## Introduction

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Hello and welcome to Hope for Health. I'm Dr. Dan Royal. Hope for Health is brought to you by New Hope Medical Center. We invite you now to enjoy this informative program on health alternatives. Today's guest is a researcher and expert in the area of female hormones. He received his doctorate of philosophy in endocrine physiology and biochemistry from the University of Oregon in 1972. He has taught courses in endocrinology, physiology, the brain, and aging at such schools as the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and the University of Oregon. He is the author of several books, including *Progesterone in Orthomolecular Medicine* and *Nutrition for Women*. He also has a monthly newsletter which he's been writing since 1980. His name is Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat, welcome.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** It's nice to have you with us. You're in Eugene, Oregon, correct? We're here in Las Vegas where it is sunny. You're there where it's overcast. I used to live there for 15 years, so I know exactly what it's like. It's raining or drizzling constantly. Are you familiar with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), where people become depressed because they're not getting enough sunlight?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. 35 years ago, when I moved to Eugene from southern Oregon where there's a lot more sun, I wondered why I was feeling lethargic and depressed. I realized we hadn't had a day of sunlight for about two months straight. That was when I really started getting interested in the hormonal effects of sunlight. When I moved back after being in Mexico for several years, I started seeing graduate student young women who had moved to Eugene and immediately started having hormonal problems, PMS, and worse symptoms.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** What did you do for yourself to correct that problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Trying to get as much sunlight as possible. But when there's no sunlight, I keep a couple of infrared bulbs—farmers use them for brooder lamps to keep baby chicks warm. They have a clear front and a reflector built-in, but they have a lower temperature than the usual incandescent bulb. That means the light penetrates more deeply. It's rich in red and orange frequencies. I keep about 500 watts shining down on me all the time when I'm indoors.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** That sounds like a very interesting approach, similar to the infrared sauna which can penetrate deeper without having to overheat the patient. What about using ultraviolet light? Isn't that also a treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have an 80-year-old mercury vapor lamp that I use for getting extra vitamin D once in a while. But I also take some vitamin D. I like to take it through my skin because I never have much confidence in how pure the excipients are in supplements. Taking it through my skin works fine for keeping my vitamin D up.

## Supplements and Allergies

**Dr. Dan Royal:** We have the same concern in our clinic about using the best quality supplements because a lot of products out there, especially the ones made by pharmaceutical companies, are very cheap but ineffective. Patients read about the great results from taking certain B vitamins or vitamin E, buy it on the cheap, and wonder why they're not getting results.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thirty years ago, I was doing a lot of counseling with allergic people in Eugene. Eugene is near a big grass-growing area, and at the end of the summer, they burn the fields and release chemicals into the air, so the asthma rate is very high. I found that giving them supplements and a good diet, especially rich in vitamin A and pantothenic acid, took care of a big part of the population with allergies. However, there were many that didn't improve. I found that if I got them to use natural foods and avoid all of their supplements, all of them improved. It turned out that many people taking a lot of vitamin and mineral supplements every day were actually allergic to the excipients in the products.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** That's a good point. Our experience is that patients have a threshold. When they are exposing themselves to allergens—whether in food, air, or supplements—they all add up. They have a cumulative effect, and then you reach that threshold where they become reactive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the total burden and the amount of energy you have to deal with the burden that produces symptoms. If your blood sugar is low, almost anything becomes a serious allergen. With animal experiments, they found that with the weakest allergen, if they lowered the blood sugar with insulin, the animals would die in shock. But if they gave them extra sugar, even the allergic animals would get nothing but mild sniffles from a deadly, super-strong allergen.

## Hypoglycemia and Thyroid Function

**Dr. Dan Royal:** What about reactive hypoglycemia, where patients eat something that raises their blood sugar and then it drops over a short period? Are these patients more susceptible to allergies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can become a vicious circle. Normally, when you are exposed to a stress or an allergen, you put out a little extra cortisol to improve your immunity and lower inflammation. But that can start suppressing your thyroid function and lowering your liver's detoxifying ability. Your intestine always has allergens in it. The chronic exposure to cortisol, suppressing your liver and thyroid function, allows those toxins and allergens from your intestine to get into the bloodstream.

Endotoxin is a basic substance produced by bacteria in the intestine, and that poisons our energy-producing systems. It almost turns off mitochondrial function, which wastes blood sugar. You can create hypoglycemia by exposing yourself to too many of these stresses. The quickest way to break out of the cycle is to eat a well-balanced natural diet, emphasizing a lot of fruits—orange juice, for example—because of the high potassium content. Potassium lets you handle and absorb blood sugar without disturbing your insulin. When your liver is receiving enough sugar from the combination of potassium and sugar in the fruit, it is able to activate the thyroid hormone, restoring the poisoned function of your mitochondria. It can bring you out of a chronic allergic hypoglycemic state and get you back to a steady blood sugar, sometimes in just a day or two.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** You mentioned a couple of things most people are not aware of. Number one, orange juice has potassium. Everybody thinks about bananas, but if you're low in potassium, you can drink orange juice. You also mentioned the liver is where the thyroid is converted from the inactive to active form.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes wrote a very good book years ago called *Hypoglycemia: It's Your Liver, Not Your Mind*. He was one of the first to emphasize that most of the active thyroid, about 70%, is produced in your liver rather than in the thyroid gland. The gland in your neck produces about 30% of the active hormone. Anytime your blood sugar falls—if you go without eating for eight hours, for example—your liver doesn't want to convert your tissues to food, so it stops making thyroid. Your metabolism decreases and your temperature goes down so that you don't burn up your body too fast.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Doesn't that conversion also take place at the cellular level?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several tissues produce quite a bit of it. The pituitary gland can detect T4 (the inactive form). Since it can convert it, it doesn't distinguish very strongly between whether you're taking T4 or T3; it turns off its activity whenever it sees T4 or T3. Since it produces just a tiny amount for its own detecting purposes, if you accumulate too much thyroxine (T4) in your tissues, your pituitary thinks you have enough thyroid, but your liver might not be producing any active thyroid hormone from it at all.

In early experiments, they took slices of different organs and added thyroxine. They found that the liver became fully activated with a modest amount of thyroxine added. The kidneys converted a little and were slightly activated. The muscles were not activated at all. But the brain, when thyroxine was added, was actually suppressed. The brain normally has an extremely high concentration of the active T3. Locally, too much T4 affects your brain in an anti-thyroid direction. Very few doctors are aware of the risks of prescribing plain thyroxine.

## Synthetic vs. Natural Thyroid

**Dr. Dan Royal:** That's a very good point. The audience may not understand that thyroxine is T4, which is the same thing as Synthroid. This means the most common thyroid medicine being prescribed has no active thyroid in it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's true. Because of pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, the FDA has begun forcing the producers of natural thyroid products, such as Armour Thyroid, to put on their label the ingredients in terms of T4 and T3. But natural thyroid contains neither of those; it's a protein. When you digest the protein, your digestive system releases those hormones. When the gland digests itself in normal functioning, that protein breakdown releases about three or four parts of thyroxine for each part of the active T3. That's why your liver has to convert the thyroxine. Similarly, when you take a supplement of Armour Thyroid, you digest it in that same ratio. This means you can't go very far wrong taking the natural substance because the ratio entering your blood is within the range produced by your normal gland.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Typically, the natural thyroids have a ratio of about 4:1, T4 to T3. In our practice, we often increase that ratio to 3:1 by adding a little Cytomel, which is pure active T3. We usually do that if the patient has developed antibodies to their thyroid, or if they are taking Synthroid and have introduced a foreign substance the body attacks. I had one patient who started gaining weight on thyroid medication; every time they upped the dose, she gained more. We checked her antibodies, and they were very high.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was teaching at the naturopathic college in Portland, someone from the University of Oregon Medical School told about a woman who had been prescribed the equivalent of one grain of thyroxine (about 100 micrograms). She got more hypothyroid, so they kept increasing the dose. When they reached 400 micrograms of thyroxine, she went into a myxedema coma. They took her to the hospital unconscious and kept her alive until someone figured out she wasn't converting T4 to T3. It had turned her brain metabolism off to the point that she was no longer conscious. When they gave her T3, she recovered immediately to full functioning.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** So it's important to have a healthy liver if that's where three-quarters of the conversion is happening. If you're taking inactive thyroid and it's suppressing the brain, can't it build up and cause other symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many people have told me that when they were given supposedly the right dose of thyroxine, they began getting symptoms like ringing in their ears and prickly sensations—common symptoms of hypothyroidism. When they added T3, the symptoms would go away.

## Thyroid Diagnosis and Testing

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Many patients tell me their doctor checked everything, but they only looked at T4 or TSH, never the antibodies. In your opinion, what's the best test?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way they did it in the 1930s, before the drug companies took control of the journals and medical schools, was to look at symptoms. When they saw symptoms, they would test the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)—how much oxygen they consume at rest. That is the absolute way to determine what's happening. It doesn't matter how much is in your blood if it's being blocked. For example, if you have eaten too many polyunsaturated fats or too much cabbage, you can have an excess of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream and still not be consuming very much oxygen.

Americans, on average, are about 25% hypometabolic or hypothyroid compared to countries where they don't eat so much artificial food. The practical thing is to go by symptoms and physiological indicators. For example, reflex reaction time. If you flash a light in a person's eye, the pupil is slow to respond if they're hypothyroid. Body temperature tends to be below normal, though an excess of stress, adrenaline, and cortisol can artificially raise it.

There is also the Achilles tendon reflex. If you have a person kneel and thump their Achilles tendon, a person with almost any thyroid function will have the reflex. But you watch how quickly the foot relaxes back to its resting position. A hypothyroid person's foot looks like it has a pneumatic door closer on it; it returns slowly. A person with good thyroid function has a foot that looks like a piece of rubber; it relaxes and bounces back instantly.

## Cholesterol and Thyroid Connection

**Dr. Dan Royal:** I see the high blood fat issue frequently and the cholesterol industry built around it. I would think one sign of high cholesterol would be low thyroid, because with a healthy metabolism, you should process those fats effectively.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver is a big source of disposal for cholesterol, but the ovaries, gonads, brain, and adrenal glands all use considerable amounts of cholesterol. In one experiment, blood containing a known amount of cholesterol was pumped into an ovary, and the amount of progesterone coming out corresponded exactly to the amount of cholesterol going in. If you lowered the cholesterol, you lowered the progesterone produced.

If you force your cholesterol down with a drug, you are likely to see problems. Many studies have shown increased rates of accidents, cancer, suicide, and death by homicide in people who were drugged to lower their cholesterol. The Framingham study found that people over the age of 50 whose cholesterol was below 200 were much more likely to become demented. Cholesterol makes those protective hormones, like progesterone in the brain, which is extremely protective against injury and toxins.

## Caller: Insomnia and Thyroid

**Geraldine:** When I was 16, they thought I had a broken jaw and took many X-rays. Right after that, my thyroid went out. I have trouble sleeping, gaining weight—the whole thing. What do you suggest for medication?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The usual thing is to check the diet and make sure you are getting enough good protein. A protein deficiency makes the liver unable to activate the thyroid hormone, the same way a lack of sugar does. You need at least 80 grams of high-quality protein, like milk, cheese, or eggs.

The symptoms you mentioned are classical hypothyroid symptoms because the brain needs energy to sleep properly. EEGs show that hypothyroid people never get into deep, restful, slow-wave sleep. They stay in superficial sleep. Even worse, they often have insomnia because when your nerves or muscles are not producing enough energy, fatigue accumulates and they are unable to relax. It's the same as the Achilles reflex test—you're slow to relax. A doctor I visited had insomnia for days. I suggested Cytomel. The next day he said, "That stuff's better than opium." He was sound asleep 15 minutes after taking a little bit of the active thyroid hormone.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Patients have the misconception that thyroid is some kind of amphetamine that will keep them up. They don't understand that thyroid helps you relax.

**Geraldine:** Thank you very much.

## Adrenaline, Cortisol, and Sleep

**Dr. Dan Royal:** If the thyroid is having a problem, the adrenals tend to take over. Cortisol levels can be elevated, interrupting the sleep-wake cycle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the sun goes down, the red light or sunlight that penetrates deeply into your cells activates processes that protect you against free radicals. After about an hour of darkness, your mitochondria start losing efficiency. When darkness has lasted for several hours, your blood sugar becomes a problem. That's why your cortisol rises after you've been asleep for a couple of hours; it keeps getting higher until dawn. That allows you to stay asleep because the cortisol breaks down protein into sugar, letting the thyroid function and nerve cells repair.

However, if your liver didn't store enough glycogen, you will have an adrenaline reaction trying to get more glycogen to compensate for low thyroid function. Low thyroid people often produce 30 or 40 times more adrenaline than a healthy person. That wakes you up with a start. The adrenaline triggers increasing cortisol, which starts damaging your tissues, converting muscles to sugar to keep your brain working. These low thyroid people who compensate with high adrenaline and cortisol will sometimes wake up with a temperature of 98.6 or 99 degrees. But if you take their temperature an hour after they've had orange juice and food, you'll find it drops to the hypothyroid range (95 or 96 degrees). It's only the stress hormones before breakfast that keep them up to a normal temperature.

## Caller: Child Hypothyroidism

**Yolanda:** I have a 12-year-old diagnosed with hypothyroidism. She was gaining weight that didn't correlate with her food consumption. Her T3 came back high, but she was diagnosed based on TSH and T4. She's been on 0.88 of Synthroid for two years.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** If T3 is elevated, a hypothyroid diagnosis doesn't make sense unless they are checking T3 uptake, which is a mathematical guesstimation, not T3-RIA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are three times when women are more likely to become hypothyroid: puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. You can see the thyroid gland enlarging. As estrogen rises, the brain senses you need more thyroid hormone and puts out more TSH, but the estrogen blocks the enzymes that digest the protein in the thyroid gland, so it stops secreting the active hormone. Progesterone activates those enzymes. You can depend on the slowing down of the thyroid whenever estrogen rises, and puberty is the most common time.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** We would typically put the patient on a grain of natural thyroid twice a day. Natural thyroid has a half-life of about 8 to 12 hours, as opposed to hanging around for 24 hours waiting for conversion.

## Caller: Wilson's Syndrome and Temperature

**Stan:** Dr. Wilson has done research on subclinical thyroid where the doctor says it's normal, but people run temperatures of 97 degrees, have cold hands/feet, and are sluggish. Does Armour Thyroid fix this issue by unclogging the thyroid so you get proper T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The stress hormones causing a falsely elevated, normal-appearing temperature is something to watch out for. If someone has a protein-deficient diet or is in menopause, they often experience excess cortisol. Cortisol accelerates dissolving of the bones and deposition of fat around the trunk. Reverse T3 rises when you're under stress and exposed to too much cortisol. A bad diet can put you into that chronic stress state. The quickest way out is with a supplement of T3. Armour Thyroid or Thyrolar will provide enough T3 for most people, but people often prefer a little more T3 to quickly get over symptoms.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Reverse T3 is difficult to document, but there are many other factors to diagnose hypothyroidism. You need a doctor who can assess whether the patient needs thyroid even if the lab is "normal."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Traditional doctors would look at signs like oxygen consumption, cholesterol, and the palms of the hands. A low thyroid person can't convert carotene to vitamin A, so they accumulate orange in the calluses of their hands and feet. Their hands and feet are almost always cold. Cold feet can cause serious inflammatory problems elsewhere. First aid for some symptoms is just to get woolly underwear and thick stockings to keep the long bones warm. You can actually cure anemia just by keeping your long bones warmer.

## Caller: Hysterectomy and Arthritis

**Earlene:** I had a hysterectomy at 36. I'm now 73. My arthritis seemed to get worse after the hysterectomy. Does this have anything to do with hormones?

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Absolutely. As a woman goes through menopause or surgical menopause, hypothyroidism can manifest.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had a friend in his 70s who had an accident and immediately started developing arthritis. He was crippled pretty suddenly. He had a doctor educated in the 1930s who immediately tested his thyroid because stress and injury can lower your thyroid. Within two weeks of treatment, his arthritis cleared up and he lived 15 more years with no arthritis. In the 30s, it was standard knowledge that arthritis was usually a sign of hypothyroidism.

## Caller: Wilson's Disease and Fat

**Bill:** I was born with Wilson's disease. I've kept it under control through diet. People say you can't live without fat, but I'm living proof that you can.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I do advocate eating saturated fats; they can have therapeutic effects. However, I am also an advocate of a fruit-centered diet. The squirrel monkey lives about three times as long as other animals of its size and has an extremely high metabolic rate; in the wild, it lives exclusively on fruit. Fruit contains the things needed to stimulate thyroid function and protect against stress. It is possible to live entirely without fat in your diet because your body can make the saturated fats it needs.

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Saturated fat is what the thyroid needs, like coconut oil. On the other hand, unsaturated fatty acids actually inhibit thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The more unsaturated the fat is, the more thoroughly it inhibits the thyroid—it inhibits secretion, transport, and reaction to the hormone. In the early part of the last century, researchers showed that animals on a fat-free diet were completely free of spontaneous cancer and lived longer than normal.

## Conclusion

**Dr. Dan Royal:** Dr. Peat, any concluding remarks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a book you might be able to find in a library that is a great introduction to the amazing things thyroid can do. It is *The Thyroid* by Thomas McGavack.
