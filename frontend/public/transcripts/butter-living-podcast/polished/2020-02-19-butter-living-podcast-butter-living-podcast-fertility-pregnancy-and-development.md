## Introduction

**Host:** Hi, Ray, how's it going?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi. Very good.

**Host:** Thank you for doing this today. I had some help from my wife, and we compiled a list of questions from a Northern California birth community and listeners of the podcast. Before we get into the questions, could you go into your background a little bit, especially as it pertains to women's issues, pregnancy, and human development?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1968, after studying many other things for about 12 years after college, I went to graduate school at the University of Oregon specializing in reproductive physiology. I did my dissertation in 1972 on oxidative changes in the uterus with aging. One of my lifelong interests was the physiology of aging, and it seemed especially relevant to the process of reproduction.

I had seen publications from the 40s and 50s showing that when you make a graph of the baby's birth weight and head circumference, both of these increase with each subsequent pregnancy. The older the mother is, the bigger her baby's brain is. That held true up until about the age of 38. At that time, women were having many more babies, so it tended to be the third, fourth, or fifth baby by the time she reached her late 30s. At that point, instead of increasing, the last birth before she became infertile tended to be lighter with a smaller head. But the general drift of both aging and parity was for the birth weight and brain weight to increase steadily.

I had started out intending to study brain physiology in graduate school, but I found that subject was completely dogmatic, whereas reproductive physiology actually tolerated a scientific approach.

## Fertility and Aging

**Host:** One of the questions from a listener was directly related to what you spoke to: maintaining fertility as a woman ages. What can a woman do to maintain fertility as she gets older?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The failure of progesterone statistically starts happening in the mid-30s. Estrogen production and concentration in the body tends to increase steadily from about the age of 20 up until the late 30s. That's about the time when aging and stress symptoms start becoming noticeable. Sometimes a woman is gaining excess weight around that age, and any kind of nutritional or environmental problem limits the ability to produce progesterone.

As the ratio of estrogen continually increases and progesterone reaches a limit determined by stress and nutrition, you start getting the signs of menopause and infertility. There are two processes that tend to extend fertility as well as lifespan in general.

One is the liver. When it is healthy, it excretes 100% of the estrogen arriving in the circulation. It makes it soluble for excretion in the urine or puts it into the bile. The estrogen that goes into the bile tends to be reabsorbed if there's not enough fiber in the diet. So, keeping a steady supply of fiber running through the intestine allows the liver to get rid of the bile-excreted estrogen.

The other is the sulfated or glucuronidated water-soluble form of estrogen that goes out in the urine. To make that happen, B vitamins and protein are the most essential nutrients. Keeping up the B vitamins and good nutrition—adequate protein and calcium—keeps the liver able to minimize estrogen. It should be 100% excreted so it doesn't build up steadily with aging. That makes the problem of producing adequate progesterone manageable because it isn't working against this rising tide of estrogen.

Vitamin A, protein, adequate minerals, a balance of calcium and phosphate, and vitamin D are the main limiting factors for making progesterone. Vitamin A is used in almost a one-to-one relationship with the amount of progesterone you produce. Thyroid hormone travels on the same protein in the blood as vitamin A. That protein, with the vitamin A and thyroid, is taken up by cells along with cholesterol and used in the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone. So, it's essential to maintain a good level of cholesterol in your blood to keep producing adequate progesterone.

**Host:** When you talk about vitamin A and the B vitamins, would it be preferable to get these from food sources rather than supplemental sources?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, supplements always contain manufacturing contaminants and breakdown products. Vitamin A, for example, is extremely oxidizable. Many people get serious side effects when they take vitamin supplements that they don't get at all when they eat foods rich in those nutrients. Eggs, milk, cheese, and liver are very safe sources of vitamin A. To some extent vitamin D as well, but if you don't get sunlight, then you will need a supplement of vitamin D.

## Progesterone Supplementation

**Host:** As a woman ages and progesterone levels decrease, does it make sense to supplement progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s, Katharina Dalton in England was treating women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) using the main progesterone product available at the time, which was injectable in oil solution. She treated them with monthly or twice-monthly injections and found that the women who suffered from PMS tended to have had babies with a high likelihood of being premature, underweight, and mentally not up to par before treatment.

She found that the patients she treated adequately for PMS were having healthier pregnancies. If they continued having a PMS symptom in the pregnancy, she would continue treating them. Many of these women had previously had monthly bleeding episodes right up into the fifth or sixth months of pregnancy and then delivered prematurely. She found that by preventing the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and headaches, she prevented the monthly bleeding episodes, and the babies were carried to full term.

After doing that for about 15 or 20 years, someone mentioned to her that her patients' babies were remarkably intelligent. She said that wasn't very likely because women who deliver prematurely are known to have children with an average IQ of about 95. She did a study and found that her babies were averaging about 130 IQ. The younger siblings were all many IQ points better. The difference was simply that the mother was a little older and was getting progesterone support.

**Host:** There was a poll where women answered whether progesterone supplementation was effective. Many said yes, but some said they weren't seeing positive effects. Why would some women not see results?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some women have a much higher need, and many products simply aren't able to deliver enough progesterone to be effective.

In 1951, there was a study using commercial progesterone for treating uterine cancer. The doctors saw remarkable improvements in the cancer, but they were giving what they considered a maximum dose—many injections of a couple hundred milligrams per injection per day. They never mentioned the patient being anesthetized or even a sedative effect. It is now recognized that the amount of progesterone the placenta produces in the latter half of pregnancy strongly affects the nervous system, preventing childbirth pain with an actual anesthetic effect and improving sleep quality.

That 1951 study demonstrated that even injecting hundreds of milligrams, it wasn't becoming available to the bloodstream. It was dissolved in oil and simply staying in the muscle or fat tissue where they injected it.

When you take it orally in a powdered form, even micronized progesterone, as it touches the lining of the intestine, a small amount passes into the cell structure. Both the intestine and the liver have enzymes to solubilize it the way the liver handles estrogen. So, any powdered progesterone that touches the intestine tends to go into the soluble form and leave the body quickly. If it gets into the circulation as sulfated progesterone, that will have its own sedative effects, but it definitely doesn't follow the metabolic pathway that natural progesterone produced by the ovaries would.

The closest you can get to natural progesterone is when it's dissolved in oil and taken orally. The digestive system breaks it up into micron-sized particles for absorption directly through the intestine into the lymphatic system. Those particles are transmitted directly to the bloodstream, circulating as fat-dissolved particles (chylomicrons) and bypassing the liver repeatedly. This allows it to be absorbed by the uterus, brain, and all tissues.

**Host:** If you are taking progesterone dissolved in vitamin E and aren't noticing effects, would a good gauge be to try taking more?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A fourth of a teaspoon of the solution containing 100 milligrams will likely bring on sleep very quickly for a man. For a woman, it will have a definite relaxing, sedative effect.

During pregnancy, the ovary (or the placenta) will be stimulated by a given dose of progesterone so that there's a positive feedback loop. It can have a catalytic effect. There were studies where women showing signs of miscarriage at the third or fourth month were given an injection of progesterone. About two-thirds of the group went from the third month all the way to full term with just that one injection. One-third needed another injection around month six. So, there is a positive feedback effect where one good strong dose will often solve the deficiency problem.

## Thyroid, Miscarriage, and Exercise

**Host:** Can you talk about the relationship between thyroid and miscarriage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone who is hypothyroid becomes subject to an excess of estrogen relative to the protective hormones: progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, and to some extent testosterone.

When the thyroid is low, tissues accumulate water and shift their metabolism toward lactic acid formation rather than carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide that should be produced under the influence of thyroid has a relaxing, sedative effect on the uterus and tends to deliver more oxygen to the fetus. When your thyroid is low and you don't produce that carbon dioxide, you make a lot of lactic acid. This has an excitatory effect on the tissues, tending to over-activate contractions in the uterus, causing stress to the fetus, and triggering cortisol production which tends to induce delivery.

Thyroid acting on the liver lowers estrogen. Estrogen itself activates cortisol production and excites contractions. The direct effect of thyroid and cholesterol on the ovary or placenta is to increase the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone. At every level of metabolism, thyroid works toward maturing the pregnancy, keeping the delivery of sugar for the embryo's brain development, keeping progesterone high, and the uterus relaxed.

**Host:** Would thyroid be appropriate as a supplement for pregnant women?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even before getting pregnant. Many studies show that thyroid hormone is the most important single fertility hormone for both men and women. I've known dozens of people who were unable to get pregnant, and usually the very first month they supplement thyroid, they get pregnant.

Another study looked at women who used a progesterone supplement for just one month preceding conception. The normal percentage of birth defects in that study was 4%, but for women who used progesterone before conceiving, there was only a 1% incidence. Progesterone has a powerful stabilizing effect on the chromosomes, and thyroid works right along with progesterone to stabilize the genetic system.

**Host:** You mentioned lactic acid metabolism being maladaptive for a fetus. Can intense exercise be detrimental to a healthy pregnancy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you look at non-pregnant athletes, one definition of overtraining is the lung's ability to diffuse oxygen. One study found that athletes who thought they were in great condition but were overtraining had a deficient ability to admit oxygen to the blood. The overtraining gave them a chronic oxygen deficit and lingering lactic acid levels.

Those with elevated lactic acid even 12 hours after exercise had lungs that had taken up so much excess water that the diffusion pathway was about twice normal. No matter how fast they breathed, they couldn't get efficient oxygenation. The same thing happens under the influence of too much estrogen. A study in mice gave one injection of estrogen and monitored oxygen movement through the lungs; they found that 95% of the diffusion capacity was knocked out in an hour following a single overdose of estrogen.

## Diet, Hydration, and Preeclampsia

**Host:** What is the most important piece of advice you would give an expecting mother?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To eat well. That means keeping protein up, having a good ratio of calcium to phosphate, getting around 100 grams of good protein every day, and a one-to-one ratio of calcium to phosphate if possible.

**Host:** What are your thoughts on the suggestion that a pregnant mother should consume high volumes of water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Water can be very dangerous. Your requirement for protein and calcium means that once pregnancy gets going, two quarts of milk a day is the minimum, along with maybe a quart of orange juice. With two or three quarts of those going in as food, you have very little need for other liquid.

If you don't balance your water intake with sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, it can have a bad outcome. Sodium is often the most important mineral lacking in pregnancy. In the 1950s, drug companies devised new chemical diuretics and decided pregnant women would be a good market. They invented the idea that you shouldn't gain so much weight during pregnancy. Almost every doctor fell for the advertising, teaching women to control weight gain largely with water pills. This had a disastrous effect on millions of pregnancies.

Progesterone is the basis for the body's ability to regulate water and salt accurately, but you have to take in a generous amount for it to work. In two studies of preeclampsia where women were developing high blood pressure, researchers tried giving large supplements of table salt. The standard prescription was to avoid salt and take diuretics. These studies supplemented several grams of salt per day and cured the preeclampsia.

When progesterone is deficient relative to estrogen, you seem to be retaining water, but you are actually losing sodium too fast. Balancing your minerals will help you get rid of the water. Albumin in the blood binds sodium via negative charges, and that combination attracts water. If you don't have enough sodium, the albumin can't retain water in the blood; it falls out of solution into tissues or out the kidneys. Preeclampsia patients lose a lot of albumin in their urine. Sodium allows albumin to stay in the bloodstream, pulling water out of the tissues and increasing blood volume to perfuse the placenta. Excess water combined with diuretics and salt restriction is a deadly mixture.

**Host:** One woman noted an increase in preeclampsia. Could it be as simple as not having enough salt and consuming too much liquid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, salt and protein. Milk especially, because it comes with the calcium.

## Prenatal Vitamins and Iron

**Host:** Are there any good prenatal vitamins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't really know of any. Traditionally, they emphasize iron. The idea that women need more iron than men isn't true because estrogen gives women a powerful advantage for efficient absorption of iron from a meager diet. Estrogen makes you attract about 10 times as much iron into the intestine as a man would.

The reason so many women seem deficient in iron isn't that they are losing it with menstruation. The average diet contains enough iron if they are absorbing it efficiently. The real cause for apparent anemia is low thyroid function. Thyroid governs the formation of red blood cells. I would guess more than half of diagnosed iron deficiencies in women are really thyroid deficiencies. The temperature of your arms and legs governs your ability to make red blood cells. If your thyroid is low, your extremities tend to be cool, slowing down red blood cell production.

**Host:** Regarding iron, a listener asked about her teenage son having high iron. Is there a way to lower it without donating blood?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person goes on a milk and cheese-heavy diet, a couple of eggs per day will provide the required iron without an excess. Milk and cheese are very low in iron. Within a couple of weeks on a meat-free diet, you will probably normalize iron stores.

**Host:** Can you talk about iron excess and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those interacting tend to start causing problems around age 45 or 50. Polyunsaturated fats tend to go into storage while saturated fats are preferentially oxidized. On a typical diet, after several decades, your tissues become very high in PUFA. We are also getting more iron than we need, overloading the liver and marrow.

This stress makes us short of oxygen—the same thing that leads to lactic acid production. It turns iron atoms into sources of reactive electrons, producing hydroxyl ions that cause tissue deterioration. When tissues are overloaded with phospholipids constructed out of PUFA, our tissue structure starts being attacked by free radicals, producing chain reactions of inflammation and toxic breakdown products that destroy mitochondria.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA) in Pregnancy

**Host:** So a pregnant woman should avoid polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Studies in cows show that even when eating grass rich in PUFA, the newborn calf's brain is completely free of them. In humans, full-term newborns are typically "deficient" in essential fatty acids, so doctors want to supplement them. However, the brain metabolism of a healthy full-term newborn is very high, and free radical breakdown products are extremely low.

In the first couple of years, the brains of healthy kids tend to be borderline deficient in so-called essential fatty acids, yet their learning ability and brain metabolism are very high. As the brain gets more saturated with PUFA over time, learning ability and metabolism slow down. In an Alzheimer's brain, PUFA levels are extremely high and bound with cholesterol, while available cholesterol is low.

You don't want to supplement a baby with these unstable, highly oxidizable fats. Many hospitals give premature babies intravenous soybean emulsion because of this absurd doctrine. Yet, studies have shown that a single injection of soybean emulsion damages animal brains. Almost all doctors will push pregnant women to eat fish oil or supplement PUFA. It is basically an advertising campaign for industry that is counterfactual and seems fraudulent.

## Stress, Cholestasis, and C-Sections

**Host:** What are some non-dietary ways to reduce stress during pregnancy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoiding things that are fatiguing. Resting as much as feels right. Fifty years ago, it was recognized that bed rest was sometimes all that was needed for a healthier delivery.

**Host:** Can you talk about cholestasis of pregnancy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High estrogen is known to be the villain. Keeping your thyroid up is the essential thing. Thyroid and progesterone are the treatment as well as the prevention.

**Host:** The occurrence of cesarean births has tripled in the past 30 years. How might this impact the generation being born?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's being done for the convenience of doctors and hospitals. They have a mechanical calendar model of when delivery should happen. If a woman is slightly hypothyroid or has a less than optimal progesterone-to-estrogen ratio, they can mature the brain properly if they just stay pregnant for another month. There is nothing wrong with prolongation of pregnancy if the woman is healthy.

By arbitrarily defining when pregnancy should terminate, hospitals are creating underweight babies with underdeveloped brains. In the last month of pregnancy, brain growth is fastest. If allowed to continue, the baby will be healthier in every way—immunity, circulation, and general vitality.

**Host:** It seems doctors are on a schedule rather than following the natural course.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many things are tending in the same direction, such as multiple vaccinations and environmental pollution. In the 1980s, in Japan, Germany, and the US, brains stopped growing statistically. In Germany, the body kept getting heavier, but without a bigger brain in proportion. In Japan and the US, there has been a downward trend in head circumference at birth.

## Autism and Vaccines

**Host:** Several women asked about the connection between vaccinations and autism. Why is autism increasing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several studies show that a woman's estrogen balance during pregnancy strongly corresponds to the risk of autism. Estrogen creates inflammation and lactic acid. Excess inflammation during gestation in animal experiments creates behavior that resembles autism.

Things that contribute to inflammation include the aluminum adjuvants in vaccinations, as well as contaminants from the culture medium (milk protein, egg protein, synthetic chemicals). The purpose of the adjuvant is deliberately to produce an inflammatory state to activate the immune system, but inflammation during pregnancy damages the nervous system of the fetus.

**Host:** What about the idea of hormesis—that a little bit of stress is good for us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is another advertising ploy. The radiation industry led the development of the idea of hormesis to explain away why commercially valuable poisoning shouldn't be grounds for lawsuits. In the 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission found that bomb tests were causing cancer, but to explain away radioactive elements in babies' teeth (Project Sunshine), they invented the idea that small doses are good for you.

**Host:** If kids are already on the autism spectrum, how can we mitigate the effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything good for the developing baby's brain is good at any age. Pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA are essential brain hormones. Some drugs developed for blood pressure, like ACE inhibitors and calcium blockers, stabilize the cell against high estrogen, lactic acid, and inflammation.

## Migraines, PCOS, and Labs

**Host:** What is the best course of action for migraines during pregnancy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My own migraines got me interested in brain physiology. I noticed girls were more likely to have them, which pointed to estrogen.

Eating a carrot every day often prevents headaches because it suppresses inflammatory bacteria in the intestine and carries estrogen out of the body. Antibiotics can have a similar effect by suppressing bacteria, lowering estrogen and cortisol.

Thyroid helps lower estrogen and cortisol. I found that supplementing thyroid and progesterone works. Once, I became hypothyroid due to fluoridated water and developed a migraine. I took about 100 milligrams of progesterone in vitamin E on my tongue. Within seconds, the visual flashing quieted down, and in about two minutes, the headache disappeared.

**Host:** How can one correct PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D is helpful. Animal experiments show that removing the thyroid and giving gonadotropin to increase estrogen produces polycystic ovaries. This implies you want to normalize the thyroid and check the estrogen-to-progesterone balance. When hypothyroidism limits the ovary's ability to make progesterone, the adrenals become hyperactive and make testosterone. You can break this vicious circle with thyroid, progesterone, and vitamin D.

**Host:** What are the most helpful labs during pregnancy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid function is key—waking temperature and pulse rate. The ratio of progesterone to estrogen is very important. Fertility clinics found that women whose progesterone was 50 to 100 times higher than estrogen were the ones who got pregnant. Animal studies show the best pregnancies occur when progesterone continues to rise steadily right up to the last days of pregnancy.

## Metabolism, Sugar, and Diabetes

**Host:** Is metabolism linked to the length of gestation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. High thyroid metabolism keeps blood sugar steady and progesterone increasing. Estrogen dominance triggers cortisol, which triggers premature delivery. You want to keep sugar intake high enough that cortisol doesn't rise.

**Host:** Is that because sugar helps brain growth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar is the primary limiting factor for brain growth. In chickens, the brain stops developing when the glucose in the egg is used up. Experimenters injected glucose into eggs and found the brain kept developing, producing chickens with bigger brains. If glucose is limited after six months of pregnancy, the human brain stops developing.

**Host:** What about "gestational diabetes"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They created Type 2 diabetes to sell insulin, and then gestational diabetes. Old obstetricians told me that "diabetic" women often had babies with very large heads. I spoke to a woman whose doctor wanted her to diet because of blood sugar around 130. She told me her previous baby, born under similar conditions, was reading adult literature at age two. I don't think the convention of gestational diabetes is very constructive.

## Breastfeeding and Childhood Health

**Host:** For extended breastfeeding (beyond two years), are there additional dietary considerations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Drinking lots of milk. Adding a quart of orange juice helps if milk supply is limited. You need lots of calcium and protein yourself.

**Host:** Does the high prolactin from breastfeeding have a negative impact?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you keep your thyroid function up, you won't experience bad effects. Thyroid supports lactation and keeps the pituitary from overproducing stress-induced prolactin.

**Host:** What causes childhood allergies and eczema?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies found women urged to supplement with omega-3 fats (fish oil) had the most allergic children. It's prenatal inflammation. Check the child's vitamin D and thyroid levels.

**Host:** What about reversing autoimmunity in a toddler?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen is the main villain. Women have five times the incidence of autoimmune disease. Stopping medical estrogen supplements often clears rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma. Progesterone, thyroid, and vitamin D stabilize the system.

**Host:** What is considered early puberty?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In coconut-based economies, the average age of puberty was 18. Coconut protected against the estrogenic effects of PUFA. Now, puberty is coming earlier—eight years old is becoming common.

**Host:** What about endometriosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen activates cell division and motility. Progesterone changes the tissue into glandular tissue. The basic problem is low thyroid. When I've seen women correct hypothyroidism, endometriosis symptoms turn off immediately.

## Parenting and Conclusion

**Host:** What is the ideal learning environment for a child?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An interesting environment. This includes adults talking about interesting things and being engaged in meaningful activity. Experiencing adults being interested in life is the most important thing for kids—to see that the world is a matter for exploration, not indoctrination.

**Host:** Do you have a parting message for parents?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Be watchful for imposed doctrines, ideologies, and procedures. Being critical of medical doctrines is just a starting point. The culture has dangerous things it wants to impose, and you have to be watchful.

**Host:** Ray, thank you so much for your time, knowledge, and thoughtfulness.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Fun talking to you.

**Host:** Bye.
