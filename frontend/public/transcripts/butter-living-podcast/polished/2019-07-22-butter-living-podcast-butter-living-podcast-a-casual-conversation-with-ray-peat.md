## Introduction

**David Butterworth:** Welcome to Butter Living. I'm David Butterworth, and this is a podcast about health and about getting back to our playful roots. On today's show, we will be speaking with a PhD, endocrinologist, artist, and a person who I think is an incredible synthesizer of knowledge. A man who seems to have painted an elaborate and coherent picture of biology in a way that I haven't seen before. His name is Raymond Peat.

Ray once wrote that once we begin to believe in the future, we understand the possibility of learning more and of being more. We appreciate the unexpected and we even anticipate the opportunity to confront it. It is in the spirit of these words that I hope today's conversation inspires thought regarding some ideal future, and how the period from conception to the first two years of life can be instrumental in paving the way for this ideal.

I'd like to reiterate that we are not advising you to do anything. We simply hope that you go out and experiment, explore, and wonder about life.

**David Butterworth:** Hi, Ray. How are you doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi. Very good.

## Morning Routine

**David Butterworth:** Thanks for being with us today. As a casual way to start, I thought it would be cool for listeners to hear what you've been up to today and what you have for breakfast.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I usually start with a big glass of *café con leche* with some very strong coffee in it. A couple of glasses like that, maybe some orange juice, and then later scrambled eggs, usually with cheese. So my breakfast takes about three hours.

**David Butterworth:** That's awesome. So you put value on how you start the day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it gives me an hour or so for thinking about what I'm going to do during the day.

## Educational Background and Blake College

**David Butterworth:** I think it's undoubted that a lot of people who listen to this are going to be familiar with you and your work, but there are going to be some listeners who know nothing about you. Would you mind diving deeply into your background and telling us why you're such a great person to listen to regarding health and life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's relevant that I was born in the middle of the Great Depression. I grew up hearing about the Spanish Civil War and Italy's invasion of Africa. I saw the Dust Bowl immigrants coming into California and wandering homeless men. It was like a precursor to Reagan's time, seeing people on the highway with their bedrolls. Between 1940 and 1980, that was rare, but in the Depression, it was a daily thing.

When the war started, our family moved from Southern California to Southern Oregon. From third to fifth grade, I was in a one-room schoolhouse outside of Grants Pass. We had eight grades in one room, so I could hear all of the lessons. When I was in the third grade, I would hear the seventh and eighth graders' lessons. That gave me an interest in the process of education and why they segregate grades so you only have the opportunity to hear what they deliver to your specific grade.

We always had encyclopedias in the house, and I started reading about education. I learned about Bertrand Russell, who was one of my early heroes, and his wife Dora. They started a school called Beacon Hill in the 1920s. From reading about that, I heard about the Experimental College at the University of Wisconsin started by Alexander Meiklejohn, and then Black Mountain College, an experimental college in the 30s.

By junior high, I discovered that those experimental ideas in education had disappeared from the culture. What was coming in 1947, '48, and '49 was the establishment of totalitarian education in the United States. The word was intended to apply to the Soviet Union, but I saw that things I had become interested in—like Lamarckism in biology, which had been a big thing at the University of Wisconsin with a guy named Guyer—had been banned from education.

When I got to my sophomore high school biology class, I realized it was being taught by a conformist. I became extremely critical and skeptical of biological and political ideas, seeing that education had been cleaned up to eliminate any non-conformist ideas.

In the 1950s, I was very aware of the dangers of atom bomb testing in the atmosphere. I realized that Linus Pauling was the only well-known person talking about the dangers of radiation. I learned that an associate of his at Oregon State University, Ralph Spitzer, had been a very successful researcher and teacher but was fired by the president of the university for writing about Lamarckism. Because of that, Linus Pauling wouldn't step foot on the Oregon State campus for 17 years.

People generally don't appreciate what a crazy culture we had in the 1950s. While I was writing letters to the editor and Linus Pauling was giving talks, they took away his passport so he couldn't leave the country because he opposed atmospheric bomb testing. The government was supporting people like John Gofman to go around lecturing, but the mood was to convince people that radioactive fallout might actually be good for you. One of the projects to study the biological effects of radiation was called Project Sunshine. Occasionally, a professor or government employee would say, "Hey, that stuff is really dangerous," and they would not only get fired, but there would be a campaign of character assassination.

In 1959, I was teaching biology at Urbana College in Ohio. I was teaching about the biological effects of radiation. By chance, I learned that a lecturer had been invited to try out for my job because they wanted someone who *wouldn't* teach about those dangers. He chose to lecture on the biological dangers of radiation, and the weekend after he was there, he got fired from his job at the University of Illinois.

He and I got together to campaign to create a college that would be able to talk about such things, that wouldn't have trustees tied to military research, and could freely investigate any subject. Leo Koch and I started working on creating a new college. Just as I was getting things organized, he got a job as a biologist at a mushroom soup company, so I was left to take over the new college, which we called Blake College.

The idea was to get faculty and students living together in a community, able to teach and study exactly what they wanted. We had it set up so that both teachers and students, after being there for six months, would become automatic trustees. There were no outsiders involved. But that didn't please the US State Department because the Vietnam War was escalating, and they cooked up ways to intervene and shut it down.

After that, I taught linguistics for a year and decided I would be more productive studying biology and trying to recover some of the insights that had been shut out of biology 40 years earlier. I decided to go back to graduate school in biology at the University of Oregon, where I got my PhD in 1972.

## The Ideal Future and Brain Development

**David Butterworth:** That gives us such a good picture of where you've come from. I want to jump right into what we plan to talk about now. What would you envision as the ideal society or living environment 30 years from now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What I did in designing Blake College was writing the fiction about what it would be like to have a place where you could do what you should be doing. That's what I think living should be: a matter of learning and exploring what we should be doing so that it's constantly in control of itself.

In 1981, I started writing a series of monthly newsletters. In one of the first issues, I wrote about the effects of the environment on the gestating brain. I got interested in the effects of education, nutrition, and environment on the brain at an early age. That was integrated into my attitude towards free education—that you shouldn't set the curriculum from outside the people who are actually doing the studying.

Education, learning, and brain development are a continuous process. It isn't a genetic apparatus of the brain which is then stuffed with information. Learning and the development of the brain is one single process. Unfortunately, our language ties into a culture which ties into people who want to manipulate others. As soon as we start learning language in that situation, the way language is controlled by institutions starts making us stupid. A psychologist once compared his daughter's development with a monkey's development. He saw that as soon as his daughter began learning language, she was unable to solve some problems that the monkey at the same age could solve. This shows that language imposes stereotyped ways of evaluating situations.

The brain is constantly being renewed and revised. Its course gets set pretty much during gestation, but you can always revise its course on a finer level at any point if you have energetic support.

Imagining the situation 30 years in the future... as it's going right now, it looks like life might not last more than a couple of weeks if the trend keeps going the way it has been. But if that can be overcome, then everything else becomes possible. We'll assume that the institutions that are indoctrinating people—like the people who control Facebook and Wikipedia—if they can be eliminated, then we can consider the actual physical limits to brain development.

We already have levels of automation so that people really don't have to work more than three or four hours a week to have all of their food and practical needs met. That leaves the question of what to do with essentially all of your free time. I think that would spontaneously tend in the direction of communication, interaction, invention, and moving on to new problems constantly.

**David Butterworth:** What do you think you'll be doing in 30 years, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That sort of thing, I'm hoping. Getting things going that are more interesting than the way they've been going in recent years. There are new generations coming on which are starting to be more critical of the existing institutions. Each generation is freeing itself from the stupefying conditions of the older generations.

One of my longtime definitions of culture is that it is the concept of the limits of what is possible. The culture teaches us that certain things are possible, and by definition, everything else must be impossible. If you simply change your mind, the limits of what is possible become undefined and very open. Changing your mind is the essence of living matter. Biology is changed by every experience. The brain is constantly in development, and that involves what you're learning. So what you learn changes your structure, and therefore your mind has changed. You're changing your past every time you learn something because you become a different organism.

**David Butterworth:** I love that. It reminds me of William Blake, who said something to the effect of, "The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that sort of thing was why I was attracted to Blake. One of his phrases was "the intellectual fountain."

## Nutrition and Brain Development

**David Butterworth:** Let's go back to some of those behaviors and conditions from conception to the first two years of life. Can you be more specific about the things that are valuable in that period, and how being thoughtful about this beginning can pave the way for a biologically energetic future?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A biochemist named Stephen Zamenhof experimented with brain development in chicken embryos. He found that the brain stopped developing at the same time the glucose reserve in the egg was depleted. He added glucose, or amino acids that could be turned into glucose, to the egg. He waited until the day he knew the glucose would disappear, then punched a hole in the egg and injected glucose. He showed that the injection allowed the brain cells to keep multiplying right up until hatching. Those chickens had bigger brains than chickens had ever had and were more intelligent.

About the same time, Marian Diamond at the University of California was studying the effects of environment on the brain. It was very Lamarckian. Just by giving rats an interesting environment—playground toys and other rats to visit with—their brains got bigger and their enzyme activity changed. The thing that was discussed least was that their offspring had bigger, more intelligent brains. I read that over four generations, they saw a progressive increase in both intelligence and brain size.

During the 1960s, other observations were made. Rats and dogs both had their brain development limited by excess estrogen, which lowered their blood sugar and made glucose less available. Glucose is essential for brain development. Too much insulin or too much estrogen—which activates insulin—would lower blood sugar and simply turn off brain cell multiplication.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were the other main thing that would stop brain development by interfering with the use of glucose. It was a well-recognized principle that fats block glucose oxidation.

So, three things were known to limit brain growth and intelligence:
1.  Lack of glucose.
2.  Excess estrogen/insulin.
3.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Progesterone was the main thing that protected against estrogen and the excess insulin effect. Progesterone affecting the hormone balance was found to produce this trans-generational advance of the brain.

After I got my PhD, I found that the Catholic University in Valparaiso, Chile, was about to institute a new branch specifically to study the influence of nutrition on brain development. I was contracted to direct that program, but the 1973 Nixon-Kissinger coup stopped that whole project.

## Progesterone and Intelligence

**David Butterworth:** You mentioned the impact of progesterone. If someone were to supplement with progesterone, what kind of dosages do you think would be appropriate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Katharina Dalton in the 40s and 50s was treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menopause patients. She had many patients suffering from poor nutrition who also had PMS. She gave them progesterone injections. After several years, someone noted that her patients' babies were superior intellectually. Dalton doubted this because women with PMS are likely to have pregnancy problems and premature deliveries, and their babies usually average a few points below normal IQ.

She studied it and found that all of the progesterone babies were academically superior. Just like the chickens, they had better brains from being exposed to the protective metabolic regulator. She said they were typically around 130 IQ instead of the 96 IQ average of their older siblings who were untreated. It was about a 34-point improvement in IQ just from that one addition.

Knowing that, I started telling people about her work. At the same time, I realized doctors had been indoctrinated with the idea that oral progesterone is ineffective. By the 1970s, everyone thought you had to give it by injection. The solvents used to inject progesterone—benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate—were neurotoxic, yet the progesterone was so nerve-protective that it still had beneficial effects.

I looked for a way to convince doctors to use progesterone orally. I found that it dissolved very well in Vitamin E, which allowed it to be taken up with fat droplets (chylomicrons). This allowed it to bypass the liver's metabolic changes and be delivered directly to the bloodstream and cells. Locally, in the mitochondrion, Vitamin E and progesterone supported each other.

I was giving this mixture to friends who were pregnant. Another friend was raising Afghan dogs. She said Afghan dogs are typically untrainable, but when she treated a dog with pregnancy problems using oral progesterone, the pups not only survived but had bigger brains and were trainable—uncharacteristic of that breed.

My friends with the progesterone babies told stories about the precocious things they would do. One story was about a four-year-old girl. She had started a notebook with her 8-year-old brother's name and her grandfather's name. She drew three lines under her brother's name and five lines under her grandfather's name. She said, "I want each of you to teach me three new things every day." When asked why the grandfather had five lines, she said, "Because you know more than he does."

## Progesterone Dosage and Pregnancy

**David Butterworth:** I'm holding a bottle of Progest-E replenishing oil. What are your thoughts on how much a pregnant woman would want to take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Katharina Dalton divided her patients into those who received around 1,000 milligrams total per pregnancy and those who received at least 1,500 milligrams. There was a clear division in their academic record; the ones that got more were the brightest.

**David Butterworth:** Is there an upper limit? Is it safe to consume?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's a statistical thing. When you look at women with preeclampsia symptoms—caused by low thyroid, high estrogen, and low progesterone—about a third of them only needed one injection to resolve their symptoms for the whole pregnancy. Sometimes a single dose will normalize the whole pregnancy.

But to be sure, it's best to check frequently to see if your progesterone/estrogen ratio and thyroid function are where they should be. Progesterone should rise steadily in a healthy pregnancy from conception straight up to the day of delivery. If it rises steadily, it keeps a great excess over estrogen, so estrogen can't interfere and stop brain development.

## Glucose, Salt, and Toxemia

**David Butterworth:** You mentioned glucose being one of these protective factors. Are you saying sugar is okay for pregnant women? And where might they get this glucose in their diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tom Brewer wrote about this. He and others, like Shanklin and Hodin in their book *Maternal Nutrition*, campaigned against pharmaceutical companies that had indoctrinated doctors to control weight gain during pregnancy using diuretics. Along with diuretics, they restricted sodium.

Brewer, Shanklin, and Hodin showed that restricting salt or using diuretics stopped brain development very prematurely. Brewer emphasized salt and protein. He showed that protein deficiency was the main historical cause of eclampsia or toxemia. Pregnant women should get at least 100 grams of good protein a day—130 grams would be better. He also wanted to assure they weren't restricting salt; they should eat salt according to taste.

Shanklin and Hodin reported experiments in Australia where women with signs of developing toxemia were given supplementary salt. One group got 6 grams of extra sodium per day, the other 20 grams. In both cases, they were immediately relieved of the toxemic symptoms.

Salt allows the albumin in your blood to bind water and keep it in your bloodstream. Low thyroid, poorly nourished women lose sodium easily in the urine. Thyroid causes sodium retention, and that sodium binds water, keeping blood volume up. This perfuses the kidney with a good volume of blood, so the kidney stops sending signals to raise blood pressure. Salt alone prevented the hypertension of pregnancy in those cases.

I suggested this to friends with PMS who retained water. They found that salting their food to taste stopped the cycle of salt craving and water retention.

## Dietary Recommendations for Pregnancy

**David Butterworth:** If an expecting mom asked for six or seven foods to eat regularly for a healthy, resilient baby, what would you suggest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
1.  **Milk:** At least two quarts, maybe a gallon, preferably low fat or 1% for protein and calcium.
2.  **Eggs:** Two or three a day.
3.  **Orange Juice:** Lots and lots of orange juice to provide carbohydrate.

The sugar in orange juice helps lower stress hormones. The calcium and sodium in milk both act to lower stress. Sugar supports the anti-stress effect of calcium and sodium, keeping down inflammation. Stress and inflammatory hormones are what progesterone is there to prevent. So when you do these nutritional things, you are supporting the effects of the progesterone.

**David Butterworth:** Would you be partial to fresh-squeezed orange juice over store-bought?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's important to get the sweetest orange juice you can. You don't want to overload on the citric acid that some juice has in excess. Good, sweet, fresh oranges are ideal.

## The Dangers of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)

**David Butterworth:** Can you give some examples of polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the liquid fats: safflower oil, soy oil, canola. Anything that is liquid at room temperature is questionable. If it's still liquid at refrigerator temperature, then it's really seriously toxic.

At birth, a calf has a brain which is almost purely saturated fats. A human baby, even if the mother has been eating a junk diet with a lot of polyunsaturated fat, is usually born with what medical definitions call an "essential fatty acid deficiency." That is actually a normal condition; the baby's brain *should* be very highly saturated.

Glucose is the main energy source for the developing brain, and it provides the substance to make the saturated fats and the Omega-9 unsaturated fats (Mead acid) which are intrinsic to our own production. The presence of Omega-9 fatty acids is natural in healthy, glucose-and-progesterone-supported brain development. However, doctors have been taught to define this as a deficiency of soy/safflower oil fatty acids. When they recognize an ideal situation, they call it a serious nutritional deficiency and start advocating formulas with added algae oil or fish oil—the highly unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA.

**David Butterworth:** Why are unsaturated fats so unstable and toxic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One argument used to sell fish oil is that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It interferes slightly with the production of prostaglandins made from the Omega-6 series. That is good, but it comes at the cost of immune suppression. The free radical breakdown products are toxic to white blood cells.

People who follow the course of ingested fish oil find that as soon as it reaches the bloodstream, it is already in a mainly oxidized, breakdown condition. These oxidized products are immune-suppressive.

A little bit of this material is incorporated into the brain. As the baby grows, it dilutes these, so by age 20, the brain hasn't accumulated a great amount. But after age 20, there is a steady accumulation of fish-oil-type fatty acids. When they break down spontaneously—without enzyme action—they produce pro-inflammatory derivatives like isoprostanes and neuroprostanes. These create inflammation and degenerative symptoms.

A baby at birth has an extremely high metabolic rate and an extremely low PUFA content in its tissues. Its learning ability is spectacular. That corresponds to a metabolic rate about 2.5 times faster than an adult. As their tissues accumulate PUFA, by age 20, their metabolism has slowed quite a bit. As they keep accumulating PUFA, the metabolic rate keeps slowing down as degenerative conditions set in.

## Puberty, Stress, and Metabolism

**David Butterworth:** Is it possible for a young organism to keep tissue content of polyunsaturated fat low through what we consume?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Puberty is one of the things brought on by stress. If you look at plants, when the water supply is deficient, they go to seed earlier. When I worked in the woods, the foreman pointed out that you can make a pine tree produce cones by whacking it with an axe. It senses danger and decides it has to reproduce.

Puberty is similar. When the body senses its metabolism is being slowed down, it turns on the reproductive system. In extreme stress conditions, kids can start becoming pubescent well before age 10. In tropical areas where the traditional diet incorporated lots of coconut fat (a saturated fat), it was normal for girls not to menstruate until around age 18. That is almost twice the years of PUFA-free development compared to 9-year-olds in the US.

That slowdown of metabolism corresponds to the increase of estrogen without proper opposition by progesterone and thyroid. It sets up premature degenerative diseases: menopause, cancer, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, and so on.

**David Butterworth:** So a nice approach would be to keep stress low, cook eggs in coconut oil and butter, and get a lot of sunshine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Sunshine is an extremely important factor. In tropical areas, culture often teaches people to cover up. I've had friends in the tropics who avoided the sun so thoroughly they were Vitamin D deficient.

Calcium intake can make up for a partial Vitamin D deficiency. Sugar helps make up for calcium and Vitamin D deficiencies because part of their effect is to keep the metabolic rate high. Combining good calcium intake, lots of carbohydrate, and lots of sunshine—along with low PUFA intake—is good protective insurance against degenerative diseases.

## Light, Darkness, and Stress Hormones

**David Butterworth:** What are your thoughts on trends like ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting regarding a developing fetus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of those fad diets are based on experiments in rodents. People usually get it wrong because mice and rats are nocturnal. If you study them in the daytime, you are stressing them because they should be sleeping.

Darkness itself turns on stress hormones. The red component of light has an electron-quenching effect; it calms excited electrons. In sleep experiments, researchers found that in everyone, every 15 minutes of darkness caused cortisol levels to increase, rising to a peak around dawn. Sunlight would then lower it.

Darkness is stressful, increasing all stress hormones. Deep sleep is our defense. But if stress and malnutrition have lowered your hormones (like in hypothyroidism), you don't get into the deepest phase of sleep, so sleep isn't restorative.

Among the stress hormones are those that regulate sodium and calcium. Sodium inhibits the rise of aldosterone, and calcium inhibits the rise of parathyroid hormone (PTH). These rise during the night. Aldosterone and PTH interfere with mitochondrial energy production the same way polyunsaturated fats do.

Having some salty soup or a glass of milk at bedtime helps. Milk (protein and sugar) inhibits the rise of PTH and cortisol. Salty soup (especially with gelatin) helps prevent the rise of aldosterone. This prevents the deterioration of mitochondria during the night. Night and winter are where most aging and degeneration take place.

## Radiation and EMF Effects

**David Butterworth:** What are your thoughts about a pregnant woman staying up late with a laptop or cell phone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cell phone environment, especially having one near your head or torso, is a very important factor. The industry claims radiation is harmless if it doesn't increase tissue temperature, but that is based on crude, science-free doctrine. Biologists have demonstrated great sensitivity of cells to even weak electrical fields.

A Russian researcher, Yuri Holodov, demonstrated that the gonads and the brain are the most sensitive tissues. The "bystander effect" refers to the fact that radiation can seem to bypass DNA and cause no immediate mutation, but the poisoned cells will be in a destabilized state. Even years later, the rate of spontaneous mutation becomes higher.

An irradiated cell emits small, irritating particles. Surrounding cells receive these and become destabilized. So, laying in bed with a cell phone right above the womb is an energy drain. Even if it isn't ionizing radiation, the energy drain creates stress, and stressed cells send out those bystander effects.

## Parenting, Communication, and Play

**David Butterworth:** I want to close with a quote from Bertrand Russell: "When you want to teach children to think, you begin by treating them seriously... you talk to them candidly... and you make them readers and thinkers of significant thoughts from the beginning." How can parents raise a child to inhabit a future that is full of wonder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly what Bertrand Russell said. When I lived in Mexico, I noticed kids were different from kids in the US. In the US, the idea was to give kids "age-appropriate" information. In Mexico, adults treated children as little adults. They were fully responsible and could be communicated with.

James W. Prescott studied different cultures and found that those free of violence had, from a very early age, touched, held, and moved their babies continuously. In the US, touching has been institutionalized away. Continuous physical stimulation and talking to kids with an adult vocabulary right from infancy is crucial.

I once demonstrated this with a kitten. A girlfriend was talking baby talk to her weaned kitten. I told her she had to enunciate clearly. I told the kitten, "Go look at yourself in the mirror." The kitten ran to the mirror and looked. Later, I told the kitten to pick up a piece of Christmas tree trimming and look in the mirror. It did. I'm sure kids are at least as intelligent as kittens. I think people should start talking to them seriously from the day of birth.

**David Butterworth:** How might play fit into all of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think everything should be play. Studying needs to be thought of as play. It's a property of life, and it's a type of thinking. If you want to solve a problem in physics, you have to play mentally—play with objects, investigate things playfully. It's an attitude without which you don't have science; you have dogma.

**David Butterworth:** Ray, thank you so much. Where can a listener read more of your work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My website, raypeat.com.

**David Butterworth:** It's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye.
