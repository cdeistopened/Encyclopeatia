## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** Adam Bergstrom is a good friend and great researcher. He is on our show several times a month and knows a lot about the work of Dr. Ray Peat. Adam, are you there?

**Adam Bergstrom:** I am here.

**Patrick Timpone:** Ray Peat is a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968 and has papers in physiological chemistry and physics. Dr. Peat, good morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are you most passionate about these days?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I’ve read Adam's stuff on "Yellow Fat Disease." Very great work.

**Adam Bergstrom:** Thank you, Ray. Thank you for turning me on to the concept because the first time I ever heard the words was out of your mouth.

## Yellow Fat Disease and PUFAs

**Patrick Timpone:** When did you first get turned on to the yellow fat thing, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, a family friend of ours was a chinchilla farmer. He found that fish were poisoning his chinchillas. That made me check the idea of essential fatty acids. In the late 40s and early 50s, anytime someone mentioned the idea of essential fatty acids, it was very tentative.

In 1946, a research institute in Texas demonstrated that the so-called fatty acid deficiency disease was really a vitamin B6 deficiency. They fed rats a fat-free diet, caused the scaly skin symptoms, and cured the disease with a supplement of vitamin B6 without any fat added. So, I grew up with the concept that fatty acid essentiality was first a mistake, and then it turned into a fraud.

In the 1970s, I saw research in which they fed saturated fat, highly polyunsaturated fats, or a mixture to rats through their whole lifetime. They found that it wasn't the quantity of fat that made them obese; it was the degree of unsaturation. The ones that ate saturated fats, such as coconut oil, were lean at the end of their lives, no matter how much they ate. The ones that ate only polyunsaturated fat were fat at the end of their lives, even if they had a low-fat diet.

**Patrick Timpone:** These are the classic things Ray Peat calls PUFAs.

**Adam Bergstrom:** Polyunsaturated fatty acids, highly unsaturated fatty acids, Omega-3s mainly—DHA, EPA, ALA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are so sensitive to oxygen degradation that people have checked the blood content after someone eats a fatty fish and found that very little of them even reach the bloodstream. When they do, they are an oxidized breakdown product. The great majority of the fat is degraded by the time it gets into your bloodstream.

**Patrick Timpone:** So overall, do you think we need to be eating any fish at all?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Only because of the trace minerals that are reliably in seafood. Selenium and iodine, for example, aren't reliable in land foods. If you eat foods grown only in one locality, you can become deficient in a particular trace mineral.

**Patrick Timpone:** In your opinion, are any fish better than others to eat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The low-fat fish and the shellfish. Shellfish are great sources of copper. Oysters are high in iron, but squid is very good; it's low in iron and high in copper, selenium, and iodine. Cod and sole are low-fat fish that are safe.

## Fish Oil Supplements and Brain Development

**Patrick Timpone:** But regarding fatty fish, you’re saying before they even get to where they're going, they start causing a body problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you take a fish oil supplement and look in your bloodstream, there is enough of the oxidized fat already to suppress the immune system. That's why they use them as anti-inflammatories. The trouble is that they accumulate and create progressive suppression of your immune system.

People talk about them being required for brain structure because an adult's brain is full of fish oil equivalents. However, studies on newborns show the brain is very low in polyunsaturated fatty acids. They say you must supplement pregnant women with fish oil because babies are being born with a brain deficiency of PUFA.

But in France, there was a study where they gave PUFA supplements to pregnant women. They gave a sound test to the woman's abdomen to measure the baby's response. They found that the babies learned more slowly in utero if they had extra PUFA added to the diet, and they were born with smaller brains. Already in the 1960s and 70s, animal experiments showed that if the mother was fed a diet high in unsaturated fat, the babies were born small-brained and slow learners. If they were fed saturated fat, the babies had bigger brains and learned faster.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are any of these unsaturated fats, like olive oil, good food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Olive oil is about 8 to 11% PUFA. The rest of it is very good fat. If you hold it down to one or two teaspoons per day, you're safe.

Up to the age of 20, the body is diluting the PUFA in the diet, so the brain isn't seriously impaired. When you stop growing in size and volume, the brain and other tissues begin increasing their concentration of PUFA. From 20 to the mid-40s, the brain becomes more polyunsaturated and more at risk of stress. When you're under stress, you release stored PUFA into the bloodstream where they can become oxidized and toxic.

**Patrick Timpone:** Isn't there also the issue of fish oil and EPA/DHA being rancid due to production and storage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That gives a head start on the problem. But even if you eat the most perfectly fresh PUFA, by the time it reaches your stomach, it's deteriorating. Some of it reaches your brain and is stored for years. Every night your brain is renewing itself, but unfortunately, during the night, free fatty acids in the blood rise. By the time you're 40, the brain finds polyunsaturated fatty acids in the bloodstream that add to the damage. Every night when you're over the age of 40, your brain is at risk of deteriorating faster.

## Historical Context of Omega-3s

**Patrick Timpone:** Adam, what's the most fascinating thing you've picked up on the yellow fat thing?

**Adam Bergstrom:** I found references of it causing "Brown Heart Disease." It was known that cod liver oil was a cause of it around the time of the Civil War. Also, in 1982, the book *Life Extension* by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw basically told you to walk big circles around Omega-3s, specifically DHA and EPA. Farley Mowat, author of *People of the Deer*, noted that the Inuit avoided fish. The Canadian government gave them nets, but they wouldn't use them because they knew if they ate just those cold-water fish, they would die.

**Patrick Timpone:** Ray, do we need the DHA/EPA molecule? Can we get it from seaweeds or other places?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. If we eat only sugar for calories, we synthesize monounsaturated fat—oleic acid, the main fat of olive oil. From oleic acid, we can make Mead acid. These are Omega-9 polyunsaturated fats. An Australian researcher found that Omega-9 fats are powerfully anti-inflammatory and don't break down or oxidize easily. They concentrate in the brain and provide good stability.

The whole concept of essential fatty acids was brought back in the 1950s when the food oil industry found they had lots of cottonseed oil waste. They found they could extract the oil and make people eat it. There was a campaign to sell Wesson oil. It was an advertising ploy, and the medical industry eventually accepted it as official doctrine.

They put several hundred veterans in Los Angeles on a diet with only vegetable polyunsaturated fats versus a normal diet. At the end of eight years, there were three times as many cancer deaths in the vegetable oil group. They stopped the study because it didn't protect against heart disease, but they didn't advertise the fact that it greatly increased cancer mortality.

## Saturated Fats and Lipofuscin

**Patrick Timpone:** In general, are most saturated fats from good sources fine to consume?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The trouble is that even the "good" fats like olive oil have 8-10% PUFA, and butter or coconut oil have 2-3%. The cells don't prefer to oxidize those because they poison the mitochondria, so they are packed away in fat cells. By the time a person is 50, even with reasonable diet choices, they will have too much PUFA stored. This makes you more susceptible to stress.

**Adam Bergstrom:** It's how you make lipofuscin, too. Lipofuscin has been shown to be not just a passive waste product; it groups into iron, zinc, and other toxic metals and uses them against the human body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1970, I was studying why hamsters aged. I found their uterus was accumulating lipofuscin. It acts like a little oxygen-consuming brown speck that binds iron. It acts like artificial hemoglobin, delivering oxygen to reducing agents, producing peroxide, and consuming oxygen before it can get to your mitochondria.

Just for fun, I put a clear plastic tube in a bottle of vegetable oil and put the other end in a glass of water. A few hours later, it was sucking up water. The oil was consuming oxygen in the process of degrading itself, just like an animal would. When you get it in your body, it competes with your mitochondria in a wasteful, destructive process.

## Grains and Preparation

**Patrick Timpone:** What is your take on grains in general?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1960s in Mexico, I got interested in how people could be fed economically. Grains are a cheap source of starch, but they come with defensive toxins. Plants put their worst toxins into the seeds as a defense against predators.

Traditional societies, like in Mexico, prepared grain by soaking it in lye or lime (nixtamalization). In China, they used ashes. Boiling grains with alkali breaks down the starches and the storage proteins (gluten-like chemicals). When people in the American South started growing corn without this traditional treatment, pellagra became an epidemic. Any grain should be highly processed to degrade the toxins.

**Patrick Timpone:** If one wants to consume organic brown rice, is soaking it for 24 hours the best way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It loses some of its characteristic taste, but it's a lot safer.

## Thyroid Health and Supplements

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: What thyroid medication does Ray Peat recommend, and why is there a scarcity of Nature-Throid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Until about 1940, the Agriculture Department didn't require thyroid glands to be removed from meats. In traditional diets, the thyroid gland went into sausages or soups. Everyone was getting thyroid as a natural supplement. After 1942, it was not permitted in food, making us dependent on supplements.

Thyroid is our natural antidote to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, which block the production, transportation, and use of thyroid hormone. Armour made a supplement for almost 100 years, but after selling to Revlon, the price skyrocketed and the formula changed.

Since the 1990s, I have been using a product made in Mexico called Cynoplus, which imitates the traditional Armour formula.

**Patrick Timpone:** You’ve been a proponent of a faster pulse rate—like 70 beats per minute—being an indication of health. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Studies in the 1980s found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate. If your blood pressure and heart rate increased slightly every year, you were doing well. If the pulse rate stopped increasing or decreased around age 70, those people didn't have a long life expectancy.

**Patrick Timpone:** If my pulse goes above 60, I feel anxious.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you checked your temperature at those times? If your hands are cold while your heart rate increases, you're running on adrenaline, which is not good. Your hands should be warm. When your temperature rises to about 98.6°F or higher, your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate and stroke volume. If you have high adrenaline, your heart has a short stroke and has to beat faster to compensate, leading to inefficiency.

**Patrick Timpone:** So if you get the body temperature up, the heart may beat faster, but you won't feel anxiety?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When your metabolism is high, you produce carbon dioxide, which has a relaxing, sedative effect.

## Body Temperature and Metabolism

**Patrick Timpone:** Regarding the Broda Barnes idea of morning temperature—is cold hands and feet solely a thyroid mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes worked in Colorado where people were seldom overheated. In humid heat, hypothyroid people can have normal temperatures. I started looking at the pulse rate as well. Brain function improves with temperature. Crows and parrots have body temperatures over 105°F and are extremely intelligent. It isn't just brain volume; it's volume plus working temperature.

You can't have cold hands and feet except during stress. Emotional stress raises adrenaline, making extremities cold. Hypothyroid people experience stress almost all the time. During the night, cortisol rises because blood sugar falls. Thyroid people have extremely high cortisol and adrenaline in the morning, which can make the morning temperature misleadingly warm. If you have orange juice and milk and your temperature drops a couple of hours later, that means you were running on stress hormones.

**Patrick Timpone:** If we can't get a good thyroid medication, do you recommend other ways?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Unless you're eating chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they are 30 or 40. Chicken necks often contain the thyroid gland. Cooking them in soup works just like the pill.

## Cholesterol, Plaque, and Alzheimer's

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener with the APOE4 gene asks about saturated fats causing plaque and Alzheimer's.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With aging, free cholesterol in the brain drastically decreases. It gets bound to polyunsaturated fats, which makes it toxic. Plaque is strictly a matter of excess PUFA attached to cholesterol.

**Adam Bergstrom:** It's in medical books that plaque is formed of PUFAs, yet they wish people to believe it's saturated fatty acids.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For 40 years, the Agriculture Department listed lard as a saturated fat, so studies on "saturated fat damage" were actually using lard, which is about 30% PUFA. Fully hydrogenated fat is very safe. A Russian study showed that saturated peanut oil reversed aging changes in mitochondria. I’ve shifted to using hydrogenated coconut oil because it has zero PUFA.

## Sleep, Sugar, and Salt

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about waking up in the middle of the night.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to look at hormones in context. If your liver and muscles are working right, your body should store sugar to draw on during the night. If you aren't producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid, you waste sugar. During the night, you run out, adrenaline and cortisol rise, and you break down tissues.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do we stay well-stocked with sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoid PUFA and eat adequate carbohydrates. When you have too much PUFA, it poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar. Within an hour or two of sleep, the body rings the alarm for more sugar. A tablespoon of sugar in milk or honey will usually put a person back to sleep.

Salt has a similar effect because it helps absorb sugar and lowers stress hormones. A salty snack can often put a hyperactive person right to sleep.

## Diet: Milk, Eggs, and Oils

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you still drink three quarts of milk a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, sometimes a gallon. The cow has a rumen that processes toxins from plants. By the time nutrients reach the milk, they are highly filtered. Even low-fat pasteurized milk is better than most alternatives.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about wheat germ oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is usually rancid and highly polyunsaturated. It’s a toxic oil, though it has Vitamin E.

**Patrick Timpone:** Eggs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Only if the chickens are fed good stuff. Commercial eggs are now mostly polyunsaturated fat. I've reduced my US egg consumption to one per day. You want to ensure they haven't been fed flax or fish meal.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you list the most active PUFAs people should avoid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fish oil, krill oil, fatty fish (like salmon), and cooking oils like soy, corn, safflower, and canola.

**Patrick Timpone:** Best oil to cook with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Butter, ghee, and hydrogenated coconut oil. Olive oil is okay in small amounts.

## TSH Levels

**Patrick Timpone:** What is your opinion on TSH levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress hormones lower TSH, so you can look hyperthyroid (low TSH) when you are actually stressed. You have to measure stress hormones and T3/Reverse T3. I've never seen a person who felt good with a TSH as high as 2.0. People are healthiest when their TSH is 0.4 or less.

## Thyroid Dosing and Recovery

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about taking fresh thyroid from cows.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to recognize the potency. One gram of dehydrated beef thyroid is equal to 15 grains of the medical desiccated thyroid. You need to be very careful.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about someone whose thyroid was radiated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They need to take thyroid. A healthy young person produces the equivalent of about four grains per day. Doctors often prescribe only Thyroxine (T4), but you need T3. You should think in terms of a four-grain replacement.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can the thyroid recover if you stop taking supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I've seen the gland enlarge and resume function almost immediately after stopping supplementation.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you support the thyroid while cutting back on supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D and calcium are extremely important. Vitamin D suppresses parathyroid hormone. Eating about 2,000 mg of calcium per day is ideal. Also, enough good sugar—a quart or two of orange juice is very supportive.

## Miscellaneous Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** What about NAD IV treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Niacinamide raises cellular NAD safely. I think injecting things intravenously risks reactions.

**Patrick Timpone:** Raw vegetables and salads?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many people are chronically sick because of green salads. The defensive chemicals in the leaves block digestive enzymes unless cooked thoroughly.

**Patrick Timpone:** Does lemon juice break down toxins in raw greens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

**Patrick Timpone:** Collagen from bone broth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good, if you use the joints (cartilage/ligaments) rather than the marrow or long bones. Chicken feet, backs, and necks are great.

**Patrick Timpone:** Iodine supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Iodized salt often causes thyroid inflammation (Hashimoto's). Seafood once a week gives you all the iodine you can use.

**Patrick Timpone:** Hemp products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The protein is okay if processed, but the oils are highly unsaturated. Be cautious.

**Patrick Timpone:** Flaxseeds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High polyunsaturated content is the problem. If used as a laxative (whole seeds), you aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff, so it's okay.

**Patrick Timpone:** Stomach acid and aging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is the source of acid (via carbon dioxide). Low stomach acid is usually a symptom of hypothyroidism.

## Conclusion

**Patrick Timpone:** Adam, anything else?

**Adam Bergstrom:** One more thing to validate the DHA thing: A salmon is high in DHA and is lucky if it lasts nine years. An Orange Roughy is the lowest fish in DHA and lives to 149 years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard up to 300 years. When they feed fish fish oil, they lose endurance and age quickly.
