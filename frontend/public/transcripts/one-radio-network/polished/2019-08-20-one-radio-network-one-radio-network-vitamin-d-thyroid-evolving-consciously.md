## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** We're happy to tell you that Dr. Peat says, "Yeah, I can come on once a month." We're going to do the third Tuesday, and that's today. Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD, University of Oregon. His specialization is in physiology. He started his work with hormones back in 1968 and wrote his dissertation in 1972, in which he outlined his ideas on progesterone and the hormones closely related to it. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** Have we had our coffee today?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep, had two cups already.

**Patrick Timpone:** You lived down in Mexico for a while?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, years down there. The first time I went down was 1955 for summer school studying painting, and many times since then. I had a school down there for a few years, an experimental college from 1961 to 1965.

**Patrick Timpone:** What kind of things were you teaching down there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was intended to be a sort of open curriculum in which teachers could teach anything they wanted, and students could study anything they wanted. The student would propose an idea and try to get teachers interested, or the teacher would give a lecture and see what the students thought.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you still spend time painting now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, almost every day. A few landscapes, lots of faces and figures—sort of integrating figures into the landscapes. It completely gets me out of the words and from reading too much.

## Energy, Structure, and the Origin of Life

**Patrick Timpone:** Talk a little bit about your ongoing research. How do you find research that you think is valuable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have a general thought in mind: understanding how everything works. Things that don't fit the established theories or paradigms just stick with me. Some of them have been in the back of my mind for 50, 60, or 70 years. That was what finally shifted my main activity from painting and literature to biology—these unanswered questions that no one was working on.

Currently, the idea is around stress, energy, and structural development. There's a young professor at MIT, Jeremy England, who a few years ago proposed a new way of looking at the origin of life rather than it being governed by chance. The really kind of silly idea behind Neo-Darwinism is that everything is random and life developed by chance. Jeremy England is saying that the flow of energy very quickly creates order, and the order will begin self-organizing.

His idea is really just a new mathematical version of the Russian Vernadsky, who started that same idea at the end of the 19th century. He was integrating the development of soil with the development of organisms in the context of the continuing flow of energy from the sun. He showed very clearly why organisms develop big brains simply by responding to the flow of energy from the sun.

**Patrick Timpone:** That's how we evolved, is what he argued?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but my interest is in how it governs development from the ovum up through the adult form. It's really the same principle: the flow of energy, ultimately derived from the sun in the form of sugar made by plants. The sugar which the mother consumes is provided to the fertilized ovum. It is that flow from glucose to oxygen that shapes the human organism. It follows that same principle that the flow of energy through the system creates order.

**Patrick Timpone:** So would that argue then that this energy has an order to it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And that's what really went wrong with Neo-Darwinism. They were horrified by the idea of spirit guiding things, so they said, "No, it's all blind and random. Matter is utterly stupid and mindless." The alternative is that matter isn't alien to spirit.

**Patrick Timpone:** I like that. It feels right.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Philosophers since before Plato's time have been onto that. It's fairly continuous through philosophy and all the cultures. It's only this fairly recent Neo-Darwinist worldview that has put things off the track. The basic horrible assumption is that the universe is random and that variation happens only by chance.

Sidney Fox, a biologist about 40 or 50 years ago, doubted that timescale had any reality. Instead of thinking of random changes in a primordial soup, he looked at volcanic energy. He took some hot lava, dropped some amino acids on it, and then splashed water on the hot rock. He looked under the microscope and had what looked like bacteria. In an afternoon, he developed a process so that high school students could create self-replicating, energy-consuming, cell-like structures in a lab class. Basically, he demonstrated that chance is not at all involved in making proteins and DNA. It's sort of a self-guiding or cosmically guided process rather than random chance over time.

## Bacteria and Oxidative Energy

**Patrick Timpone:** We've been talking a bit about parasites and bacteria. As a biologist, are we just made up of a lot of bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but they can coexist with us harmlessly. One of the people I got interested in was Frederick Koch. He developed a cancer treatment around 1920. He was a professor at the University of Michigan, and the AMA didn't like his attitude, so he was written out of science and medicine.

He showed that the treatment he used for cancer patients worked for infections. It worked simply by activating the oxidative energy system—restoring mitochondrial energy production—which activated the immune system and prevented inflammation. In the process, it made any bacteria present harmless by providing them what they needed, preventing stress to the bacteria at the same time it prevented stress to the host organism.

Some of his followers in Canada tested his materials on cows with infected udders (mastitis). When the cow was treated, their oxidative metabolism improved, and the infection disappeared. The udder became uninflamed and normal, but the number of bacteria present increased. The bacteria had become harmless and thrived without hurting the organism at all.

## Vitamin C: Oxidant vs. Antioxidant

**Patrick Timpone:** So what does that mean for us when we think about oxidative stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's exactly the wrong idea. People in the 1960s had already demonstrated that it was a wrong approach, but for 50 years, the mainstream has gone crazy on the idea of preventing oxidative stress with antioxidants. Vitamin C was a cultural icon, the basic antioxidant, but in cells, it is present in an oxidized form.

I experienced this myself in the 1960s. I decided to stop eating all Vitamin C-rich foods or supplements and analyzed the amount of Vitamin C in my urine. It dropped slightly, but I was still putting out 2,000 milligrams a day weeks after I had stopped eating any. That got me interested in what's going on energetically. Where was it coming from?

Meat and milk turn out to have a lot of Vitamin C in them, but it isn't present in the form that ordinary tests can detect. It's almost all present in the form of dehydroascorbate, a fully oxidized form of the molecule, rather than ascorbic acid. It functions in the cell as an *oxidant*, protecting against oxidative damage by maintaining normal oxidation—which is the flow of electrons all the way down to oxygen.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the takeaway regarding Vitamin C is that our body is making all that we need?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but we're getting it from unsuspected sources like meat, milk, and eggs. The organism is making it and having it right inside their cells, but in an oxidized form, which is stabilizing their oxidative system.

**Patrick Timpone:** But scientists say you have to have so much Vitamin C from oranges and whatever.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're saying it acts as an antioxidant, but its real function is as an oxidant. One of Vitamin C's main functions is to keep the oxidized state in the endoplasmic reticulum for folding proteins properly. Without Vitamin C, the protein folding goes wrong.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you take any extra Vitamin C supplementation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I stopped in 1967 or 1968. I stopped having a habitual cough right after I stopped taking the Vitamin C. After that, when I would see someone with a habitually runny nose or cough, I would suggest they stop Vitamin C, and it generally worked.

## Vitamin D, Parathyroid Hormone, and Klotho

**Patrick Timpone:** We talked to Professor Michael Holick regarding Vitamin D. He suggests 6,000 to 10,000 units. Dr. Stephanie Seneff wondered if supplemental Vitamin D does something different than the sun.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think she's very wrong and he's very right. He has pretty much turned the culture around on the issue of Vitamin D. I think its main function—not the calcium bone-building function—is that it reduces the parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is an activator of the kidney production of what they call "activated Vitamin D" (1,25-dihydroxy).

Several years ago, a mutant mouse was found that aged very fast—osteoporosis, dementia, wrinkles, gray hair. The mutant gene was called Klotho. The Klotho gene is now recognized as a regulator of calcium metabolism, and it has an anti-parathyroid hormone effect. The Vitamin D that we take, or get from sunlight, works to reinforce Klotho, the anti-aging protein. At the same time, it lowers the parathyroid hormone.

The overriding large purpose of the organism is to be conscious. The emergency purpose is to repair tissue damage. Hormones such as parathyroid hormone work on the emergency scale and divert energy from our big biological function: consciousness.

**Patrick Timpone:** So are you on board with Holick saying 6,000 to 10,000 units is reasonable? And regarding the blood test, he prefers the upper scale.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think the upper end of the scale is right. Maybe 50 to 80 on the 25-hydroxy test.

**Patrick Timpone:** I get out in the sun every day, but my level was 38. How can I explain that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The older you get, the less cholesterol there is in your skin. It's basically a cholesterol deficiency in the skin that makes older people need much more sunlight.

**Patrick Timpone:** So if I take supplemental D, would that be a good thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cholesterol can be rubbed into the skin and helps restore the youthful function. Eggs are also a very good source of cholesterol.

## Thyroid, Stress, and TSH

**Patrick Timpone:** How is parathyroid hormone tied in with TSH levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** TSH is increased by stress hormones. A person with low thyroid doesn't make their oxygen turn into carbon dioxide. They don't have the carbon dioxide needed to retain sodium, so they lose sodium. That activates the adrenals to produce aldosterone. Aldosterone directly blocks your mitochondrial energy production and increases the parathyroid hormone activity.

TSH itself is a signal of stress as well as a product of stress. TSH goes around creating inflammation. For example, parathyroid hormone shifts calcium out of the bones into the blood vessels; TSH works in that same direction, calcifying the blood vessels and increasing blood pressure.

Stress creates more adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones will suppress the TSH. So, in a defensive condition, you will look like your thyroid is normal because the cortisol is holding the TSH down. This makes TSH useless as an indicator of your thyroid status because it's just as much an indicator of your stress status.

**Patrick Timpone:** So when folks take a little bit of Nature-Throid and get their TSH level to lower, they're on the right path?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think it's good to have close to zero on TSH, as long as everything else is going smoothly—stable blood sugar, feeling good, sound sleep.

**Patrick Timpone:** You mentioned starting slow with thyroid supplementation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Traditional thyroid doctors like Broda Barnes usually started with 30 milligrams of a well-standardized product. I have seen two people who reacted surprisingly to 15 milligrams with heart pain. What's happening is that your biggest muscle cells retain magnesium and calcium in a balance. Thyroid is needed for the muscles to retain the proper amount of magnesium. If you suddenly increase thyroid when you've been deficient, your leg muscles will compete with your heart muscle for that trace of magnesium, and your heart arteries will constrict. It's very important to make sure your diet includes plenty of magnesium when you're starting to use thyroid.

**Patrick Timpone:** Just magnesium-rich foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, milk and meat will provide the magnesium.

## Fats: Endogenous vs. PUFA

**Patrick Timpone:** Masha asks: What is the purpose of the endogenous unsaturated fats, and why are they not harmful like ingested PUFAs (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Omega-9 series that we manufacture out of saturated fat, sugar, or starch means there are nine saturated carbons lacking double bonds at the tail end of the molecule. The Omega-9 series has the unstable, water-loving unsaturated carbon bonds closer to the active end of the molecule where the acid end is. The acidic end of the fat molecule is like a carbon dioxide group, which protects against free toxic electrons.

The Omega-3 system is the least stable because it has only a short 3-carbon hydrophobic tail. It has less contribution to the film property of water. The water is less tough and protected when you have these fats. At the same time, the risky, easily oxidized double bonds are farther away from the protective acid group.

**Patrick Timpone:** So olive oil is one of the safest oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because it has only 8% to 12% of the Omega-6. It provides pretty much the same fat composition that sugar would provide. Any fat we make from sugar is all Omega-9. Olive oil is something like 60% to 80% this safe monounsaturated fat.

**Patrick Timpone:** I thought HDL was good to have high?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** HDL is a protective reaction to stress. But if it's too high for too long, that is associated with some degenerative problems, like being a precursor to cancer.

## Vitamin K and Strokes

**Patrick Timpone:** Linda asks about Vitamin K for babies. Is there an oral form instead of the injection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It works even transdermally. You need a bigger dose, but it is absorbed through the skin. If the mother was eating Vitamin K while pregnant, the baby wouldn't need a supplement.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about K2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's involved in energy production, not just clotting. It's needed to make anti-clotting proteins. A Vitamin K deficiency can cause excess bleeding but also leads to abnormal clotting and strokes. It protects blood vessels against calcification.

**Patrick Timpone:** When we use the term strokes, is it usually blood clots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Officially, clotting-type strokes are several times as frequent as bleeding-type strokes. But if you look at the data, any extremely old person is likely to be having small, microscopic bleeding strokes in their brain. I think Vitamin K, progesterone, thyroid, and Vitamin D protect against that.

The so-called "transient ischemic attack" is a constriction of small arteries caused by reduced energy production. Carbon dioxide is the normal vasodilator in the brain. If your brain isn't getting enough sugar or oxygen, it stops making enough carbon dioxide, and the arteries constrict.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do we increase this carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an emergency, rebreathing in a paper bag. I've seen people lower crisis-level blood pressure in just a few hours by breathing for one or two minutes in a paper bag every 30 minutes. Increasing carbon dioxide relaxes blood vessels, especially in the brain.

## Thyroid Supplements

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about processed thyroid supplements. He didn't get results from desiccated thyroid and asks about a grass-fed supplement from New Zealand.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 30 years ago, the standard was Armour Thyroid. But the company sold their trade name, and the formula started changing. Before that, someone sent 10 products to an analytical lab, and they found that 8 of the 10 samples bought in a drugstore as prescription thyroid contained no thyroid tissue at all.

It's a refined technology to make a good thyroid product. You have to know you're getting the actual thyroid gland—I've seen people mistake lymph nodes for thyroid glands. You have to process it carefully, simply removing the fat with a solvent so it's stable.

**Patrick Timpone:** Where can we get the good stuff now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have told me recently they were having good results from Nature-Throid and WP Thyroid. But for about 30 years, I've been using the synthetic equivalents based on the old Armour composition. Cynoplus exactly copied the Thyrolar proportions. I've been using Cynoplus now for about 35 years. It is a mixture of a 4-to-1 ratio of T4 to T3. The same company makes a pure T3 called Cynomel.

## Gelatin and Amino Acids

**Patrick Timpone:** Are there any good food sources of tyrosine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Glycine and proline are the main reasons for using gelatin. Gelatin is completely free of the amino acids that are pro-inflammatory, anti-thyroid, and even carcinogenic: tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. Gelatin is a very protective protein for a mature person who isn't growing.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you take a lot of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. A book on the medical use of gelatin published around 1940 described treating diabetes and colitis with 30 grams a day. I've known people to use 60 grams a day with very good results.

**Patrick Timpone:** And bone broth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you cool it and it becomes solid, that's what you want.

## Calcium and Baking Soda

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: If powdered eggshells are pure calcium carbonate, why not just buy calcium carbonate tablets?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the manufacturer used oyster shells or eggshells, they would get a pure, safe product. But you can't count on that. When people have analyzed various calcium carbonate products, the eggshell was always the purest.

**Patrick Timpone:** He also says his joint pain subsided by putting a quarter teaspoon of baking soda in his coffee.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's actually filling in for potential calcium deficiency. The sodium tends to lower your adrenal aldosterone production. Aldosterone is an age-promoting, inflammation-promoting hormone. The bicarbonate is turned into carbon dioxide, acidifying cells and keeping them in the protected, oxidizing state.

## Skin Care and Altitude

**Patrick Timpone:** Is sulfated castor oil (Turkey Red Oil) safe for soap? Is lanolin safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Turkey Red Oil is probably okay. Lanolin is a very stiff oil, so it helps to thin it with coconut oil. Besides being a sealing agent, it is more than 50% a precursor steroid to cholesterol. To the extent it can dissolve into the skin, it's going to have an anti-aging effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about high altitude living?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies in New Mexico and Switzerland have shown heart disease decreases in proportion to increasing altitude. Every thousand feet, there was about a 2% decrease in mortality. Your body retains more carbon dioxide when you adapt slowly.

There is a myth about high altitude causing suicide by lowering serotonin. Actually, that is totally wrong. Serotonin does go down as altitude goes up, and that's why mortality from heart disease and cancer goes down. If you look at the countries with the highest suicide rates—South Korea, Lithuania, Bangladesh—they are very low altitude. The lowest suicide rates are generally in Mexico, Colombia, and Bolivia—high altitude countries.

## Diet: Carnivore, Rice, and Cooking

**Patrick Timpone:** Thoughts on a carnivore or strictly animal foods diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If that includes milk, cheese, eggs, and oysters, that's a pretty good diet. But if you eat only the muscle meats, then you have something like a 10-to-1 ratio of phosphate to calcium, which is very pro-inflammatory.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about rice or quinoa?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fats in rice are very highly unsaturated and get rancid almost immediately. The traditional Chinese way of making white rice involves removing the bran and germ. The ideal way to eat corn is the lime-processed, Mexican form called nixtamalization.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is pasteurized milk okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good tasting pasteurized milk has been held at temperature only for a few seconds and then quickly cooled. It can taste just as good as unpasteurized.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about cooking meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's overcooked, the cholesterol is progressively oxidized. Poached salmon had many times more toxic oxidized cholesterol than quickly broiled salmon. If you can bring it up to temperature in just two or three minutes, that's best.

## Porphyria and Omega-3

**Patrick Timpone:** My daughter has EPP (Erythropoietic Protoporphyria). Experts recommend a higher carb diet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, sugar is the protective thing. When your sugar is low, free fatty acids go up and poison all of your tissues. Estrogen causes a drop in blood sugar and a surge of porphyrin. Having consistent sugar intake—like frequent orange juice—is usually all it takes to prevent the attacks.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener says Omega-3 is protective to the retina.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wrote a newsletter about that. In babies, it's the Omega-3 fatty acids that are damaged by blue light or ultraviolet light. Bright light causes retinal damage specifically by the changes in these highly unsaturated fats. There is a lot of literature showing they are damaging to the retina.

## Fruit Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** Have you heard of Morris Krok and the all-fruit diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of fruits stimulate the intestine and accelerate movement, keeping bacteria happy and harmless. One problem with a pure fruit diet over the long run is that most fruits are very low in iron. You can tolerate a fairly low iron intake if everything else is good. In the US, you might end up eating a lot of bananas and dates, and those happen to be high in serotonin and can create problems of inflammation.

**Patrick Timpone:** How would you get more iron on a fruit diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In studies of Pacific Islanders who live on a potato diet, once a year they have a pork feast—one week a year—and that's enough iron apparently.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks for being here.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.
