## Cloudy Urine and Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** What does cloudy urine indicate? Is it the body wasting calcium or a yeast infection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are drinking lots of milk or eating a high meat diet, the phosphate has to get excreted. The phosphate shows up in the urine and precipitates in the presence of either magnesium or calcium. It only precipitates if the pH is above a certain point.

If you have a very high protein diet, most of the time your urine will be acidic and it will be clear despite having a tremendous amount of phosphate in it. But when something raises the pH of your urine—which can be eating a lot of fruit or vegetables, or hyperventilating—it changes. If you blow out too much carbon dioxide, the pH of your urine goes up to keep your blood at the right pH, slightly alkaline. When your urine is neutral or higher on the alkaline side, then any phosphate and calcium is going to precipitate and make it cloudy.

## Progesterone and Menstrual Cycles

**Patrick Timpone:** Here's an email from Brenda: "I recently started taking Progest-E and it's helped my cyclical mood symptoms very much. I've been taking it for days 14 through 28 in my cycle. I hate to stop taking it because I have PMS moodiness the day after I stop. Would there be any harm in just continuing to take it nonstop for a while, even if it means I miss a period or two?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known quite a few women who took some every day and kept cycling without any problem. But what they should be aware of is that if you take a little extra just before the expected time of ovulation, it will trigger early ovulation. Then, if you stop taking it or take less, it will bring on an early menstruation. So if you're going to take it every day, it has to be the same amount every day.

## Delayed Periods and Thyroid

**Patrick Timpone:** What about someone perimenopausal where the cycle takes a long time? The period just doesn't want to come. You get the bloating, but it doesn't want to come. Are there any safe herbs or anything you can do to let it go so you can feel better?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Behind the problem with the balance of progesterone and estrogen, the basic thing is almost always low thyroid. Some women will use a quick-acting thyroid so as soon as they start getting a symptom of PMS, they take just a little extra. They can adjust the hormones on a day-to-day basis that way. Other people increase their glandular thyroid starting at ovulation just knowing that they don't want to have PMS.

The opposite happens when a person is hypothyroid. They might not have any ovulation at all, or they might have extreme and prolonged menstruation. It's a very reliable treatment for prolonged menstruation to just get the right amount of thyroid. You can usually turn off a hypothyroid excess menstruation in two days with a supplement.

**Patrick Timpone:** A quick-acting thyroid is generally a prescription?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually in the US. It's a T3, such as Cytomel.

**Patrick Timpone:** And that's just a pig or cow thyroid, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it's purely synthetic, but it's exactly the same chemical that we make or would get from an animal.

## Sugar vs. Ketones

**Patrick Timpone:** Mark wants to know: "Why is burning sugar for fuel healthier for the human body than burning ketones? Also, if a diabetic wants to use fructose medicinally, how can fructose be used by the cells if the cells need glucose? Does the body convert fructose to glucose?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body can exchange them. The fructose enters the glycolysis process at almost the same place glucose does and then is oxidized the same way glucose is. A lot of doctors say that the brain, muscles, and heart can't use fructose. But actually, there is evidence that they do have the particular fructose transporter or glucose transporter that works for fructose. So the brain and heart can use fructose.

Ketones are good if you get them from fruit or vegetables such as potatoes. But if you have to produce the ketones yourself, they are only produced under stress in the body. They're good when you can get them from food, but it's hard to make them yourself without stress.

## The Budwig Diet and Flax Oil

**Patrick Timpone:** Why does the Budwig diet against cancer have so much success when it uses Omega-3 flaxseed oil, given that your work has concluded that unsaturated fatty acids are not good for us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1954, a professor from the University of Guadalajara had an article in *Prevention* magazine describing his success using laxatives for his patients to get their intestine clean. It's been known for probably 3,000 years that laxatives are helpful for cancer patients because of the toxins produced in the intestine. He happened to use a cup of linseed oil, or flax oil, as the purge. It would rush right through and clean out the intestine.

Until that time, Johanna Budwig had published as a co-author a couple of articles in a soap and fat journal and wasn't doing anything unconventional. But right after that article came out in *Prevention*, she started developing her theory of the N-3 fats. My theory was that she had gone insane during that period when she stopped being a research associate for the soap professor. Shortly after that, several little booklets came out published by a Disney subsidiary in Europe describing her theory in very crazy terms. Anyone interested in doing her program should look at those books because they were radically changed when they were presented in English to make it sound much saner than they were.

Her diet consisted of mostly cottage cheese or the equivalent curds. Because of the low iron content of cottage cheese, both milk and cottage cheese are very good protective foods for people with cancer. Fruits and milk, because of the low iron content and low PUFA content, are good for cancer patients. I think as far as the flax oil can work as a laxative, it's beneficial, but when it's working as a food, then it has the risk of suppressing your metabolism.

## Mineral Transporters

**Patrick Timpone:** John asks for Ray's opinions on Hans Nieper's mineral transporters. Why does nobody talk about them anymore?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For one thing, we don't really need mineral transporters. People like Gilbert Ling many years ago showed that the doctrine that the cell is enclosed in an impermeable or semipermeable membrane simply isn't so. When they got isotopes where they could actually see the type of sodium atom that was being added to a system, they could demonstrate that the sodium atoms were freely moving in and out of cells. There was no barrier function at all at the surface. This applies to all of the dissolved minerals and other substances. There's just no barrier there to deal with. So that's the basic thing: we don't have any need for a mineral transporter because minerals move freely in and out.

## Organic Sulfur and Iodine

**Patrick Timpone:** Jesse writes: "I don't know if Ray Peat knows anything about the organic sulfur you've been talking about. I've been taking the sulfur and iodine (Lugol's) together. My thyroid hormones have gone down. I need to know if the sulfur will take iodine out, too. Should they be taken at opposite ends of the day?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Too much iodine is probably the problem.

**Patrick Timpone:** Too much iodine can actually lower the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you know what's a good amount of iodine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've got a list of about 70 articles from around the world looking at the incidence of thyroid cancer and thyroiditis. They see that above half a milligram (0.5 mg) of iodine per day chronically increases the incidence of thyroid disease.

**Patrick Timpone:** Wow, 0.5 milligrams is not a lot, is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but that's over a period of many years where it is chronically high.

**Patrick Timpone:** I wonder how many drops of Lugol's that is. Do you have any idea how many milligrams are in one drop?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's a few milligrams.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you wouldn't want to do more than just a couple drops.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Uterine Fibroids

**Patrick Timpone:** "I'm a follower of Mr. Peat's. I haven't seen anything mentioned about uterine fibroids. What is his suggestion for the best way to get rid of them? Serrapeptase and other enzymes have not worked for me."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think normalizing thyroid is the best thing. I had an experience with a woman who was about 40 at the time, hadn't had any kids, and wanted to get pregnant. She had a fibroid plugging the end of her uterus by the fallopian tubes about the size of a tennis ball. I explained the physiology to her. She adjusted, taking enough thyroid that she could keep her estrogen level down while keeping the other hormones up.

It happens that her pulse averaged about 110 per minute. Her doctor told her she would die from keeping her pulse that fast. But she had an ultrasound every month, and every month that she kept her thyroid at that level, the fibroid shrank. I think she started around March or April, and by August the fibroid had disappeared and she was pregnant.

## Pulse Rate and Thyroid Health

**Patrick Timpone:** Is a slower pulse necessarily better?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, generally it's not.

**Patrick Timpone:** We've been told it is. I've been exercising a lot and my resting pulse is sometimes 50 or so. That could actually be a sign of weakness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, very often it's hypothyroid. Long-distance runners, for example. If you put a person on a treadmill—in one experiment they had them walk so their pulse stayed about 120 beats per minute—in less than an hour, their blood showed almost no T3, the active hormone. If a person is healthy, as soon as they catch their breath and rest for a day, their T3 is right back where it should be. But if there's anything wrong with their diet, just that moderate amount of exercise every day can push your thyroid lower and lower.

One of the ways that you might see a bad effect of a low pulse is if the distance between the top and the bottom blood pressure is very great. It should be no more than 50 points difference. It's called pulse pressure. So the systolic minus the diastolic should be 50 or less.

**Patrick Timpone:** But isn't your heart stronger if you're beating less per minute?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not necessarily. You can give a person an anti-thyroid drug and their heart rate will just go slower and slower. I've known people who had a pulse of 40 or 50 at rest and who were really very miserable. When they got their pulse up to 70 or 80 at rest by taking thyroid, they felt much better.

**Patrick Timpone:** You can often do that just by diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, avoiding the foods that are blocking your thyroid function. In America, it's mostly the polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs). But I've known people who were eating a pure soy diet or a lot of raw cabbage and broccoli. Just stopping that diet for a week or two, they popped right back.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the PUFAs and soy are definitely anti-thyroid. What about broccoli and cauliflower? If you cook them, are they okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're still slightly anti-thyroid. If a person wants to really test what low thyroid is like, they can juice some raw cabbage or broccoli and drink a glass or two of that per day.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are some things that boost thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk and orange juice.

## Hashimoto's and Autoimmune Issues

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you talk a bit about Hashimoto's? Is that overactive or autoimmune?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's underactive. Most of the so-called autoimmune things—the antibodies—really are part of a recovery process. Anytime you injure a tissue, your immune system will try to eat up the junk. It treats the tissue as if it had been infected. That's why they started calling it thyroiditis.

**Patrick Timpone:** It's not the immune system attacking your thyroid; it's doing what it's supposed to do.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you block the thyroid function for some reason, then you have to stimulate it more strongly with TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). Just that stimulation creates a type of inflammation. If that goes on too long—for example, blocking it with too much iodine, too much PUFA, or estrogen—then your immune system will come in and clean up some of the junk.

## PMS Headaches and Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** Ann says: "I'm 44 years old and the day before my period I start to get a headache. I'm assuming the headache is caused by low progesterone. I have been doing the Paleo diet for over three years now. Any suggestions?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually some good tropical fruit, orange juice, and milk or cheese will get the thyroid back to normal functioning. In the short run, a thyroid supplement can help. There have been studies where just giving even a synthetic thyroid for five or six months will correct the antibody problem in Hashimoto's.

**Patrick Timpone:** What if somebody has a hard time with casein or lactose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's no lactose in cheese, so if there's a lactose problem, cheese will take care of it. Preferably raw, grass-fed without additives.

**Patrick Timpone:** And the casein in the milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a good protein and has many good features. But an even better protein is the juice out of a potato. In a few extreme cases where a person had no digestion for any kind of ordinary protein, if they juiced some raw potatoes and then cooked that juice, they could instantly assimilate it and got over their sensitivity to other proteins.

## Bioidentical Hormones

**Patrick Timpone:** Please ask your guest about bioidentical hormone replacement. Which testing protocol would be best?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That term can apply to testosterone, progesterone, DHEA, thyroid—any of those. But it is also applied to estrogen. It happens that the most dangerous of the estrogens, estradiol, is bioidentical. So it doesn't make it safer. Whether it's synthetic or natural estrogen, you still have to be very careful.

## Ketogenic Diet and Bulletproof Coffee

**Patrick Timpone:** What does Mr. Peat think about the ketogenic diet? Also, what about "Bulletproof coffee" where you whip up coconut oil or butter into your coffee? And refined vs. expeller-pressed coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding the ketogenic diet, I already talked about that. It's a matter of stress. Anything that stresses you can turn on your production of ketones. It's better to have some sugar in your diet so you don't have the stress that makes the ketones. But if you can get ketones from fruit and potatoes, they're fine.

Regarding the coffee, a lot of people tell me they're doing that. But cream in the coffee is so good and it mixes nicely, whereas the coconut oil and butter just float on the surface.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about refined vs. expeller-pressed coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Refined is the only thing I've used. I used to occasionally get some homemade coconut oil that was just delicious for making coconut ice cream, but it happens to be allergenic. If you have any stress problems or digestive problems, it's better to use the refined, deodorized coconut oil.

## Recovering from Radiation Therapy

**Patrick Timpone:** Brian asks: "I would like to know what to do to overcome radiation therapy for prostate cancer. I did not finish the total number of treatments, but following the treatments I'm still having radiation issues."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies of people 60 years after Hiroshima and 20 years after Chernobyl in which they could still see inflammatory processes in the blood traced to the radiation exposure. It's really a lingering inflammation that you have to deal with. With that kind of radiation, nothing is actually placed in the body like with fallout. The lingering effect of external radiation puts you into an inflammatory state.

All of the things we've been talking about—the good high-energy foods like milk and cheese—help to heal that. Keeping your thyroid function up activates the repair system which lowers inflammation. Anytime your energy falls, you move towards inflammation. So don't hyperventilate. Do everything to keep your blood sugar steady and the inflammation will gradually subside.

## Omega-3s and Fish Oil

**Patrick Timpone:** William is a naturopathic doctor and wants to know what you think about Brian Peskin's claims that Omega-3s and fish oils are unnecessary.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, he's right about the fish oil. There's no evidence that it's an essential fat. But also, there's no evidence that I've seen that the "Parent Essential Oils" (PEOs) are needed either.

## Food Allergies and Heart Rate (POTS)

**Patrick Timpone:** Catherine writes: "My heart rate is about 85 sitting down, but standing up it's about 110. I was told I had POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). What is the best way to test for food allergies?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blood tests are often misinterpreted. You can see a reaction in the blood, but sometimes it's just showing that the person has been exposed to a food; it doesn't really correlate with symptoms. I think testing a food by leaving it out of your diet entirely for at least a week is best. If the symptoms go away, then you can guess that you're allergic to it.

Regarding the heart rate sitting down and standing up: High estrogen affects the nervous system so that your sympathetic side is weak and the parasympathetic is overactive. That's why women get varicose veins so much more often than men. High estrogen weakens the wall of the vein; progesterone tones up the veins. When the veins aren't returning the blood to the heart—when the blood falls into your legs—then your heart has to beat faster. Progesterone and thyroid are needed to tone up the veins and return the blood to the heart.

## The Vagus Nerve and Stress

**Patrick Timpone:** Does Dr. Peat have any recommendations for rebuilding or healing the vagus nerve?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My last few newsletters have been talking about the problems of stress, for example, "learned helplessness." If an animal is restrained and doesn't have the experience of being able to escape, they might let themselves drown in a tank of water in two or three minutes, whereas a normal rat would swim for days. That's from too much parasympathetic activity.

I've been working out some of the implications of what happens after middle age that are equivalent to learned helplessness. The body has experienced so many problems it can't deal with that it starts shifting too strongly to the parasympathetic. When we go to bed at night, normally we don't need to spend a lot of energy, so the parasympathetic lowers our blood sugar. But after middle age, it can lower the blood sugar so much that the other side of the nervous system reacts with surges of adrenaline and cortisol. That's where the degenerative things come in.

In liver disease, for example, they found that they can prevent inflammation and fibrosis of the liver just by cutting the vagus nerve so it doesn't reach the liver. So you don't want to overstimulate the parasympathetic. The Gulf War syndrome had to do with exposure to organophosphate nerve gases, but people are being exposed to similar chemicals in insecticides or even in the air in airliners. All of these exposures are creating an overactive vagus syndrome.

## Post-Meal Allergies

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the underlying cause of severe allergies like runny nose and sneezing that occur after a meal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's usually something in the intestine, not necessarily what you ate in this meal, but sometimes what you ate yesterday or the day before. Eating starts the peristalsis and it moves an irritant down to a sensitive place in the intestine. Runny nose and sneezing are the most common symptoms. Animal experiments showed that just pressure in the rectum or intestine can trigger migraine headaches, runny noses, coughing, sneezing, and even epileptic seizures. Disturbed blood sugar intensifies the sensitivity of the intestine.

## Thyroid Resistance and Reverse T3

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there such a thing as thyroid resistance or high Reverse T3 that doesn't show up on blood tests?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's important to measure Reverse T3 if you're going to measure the thyroid hormones at all. You can't interpret the T3 itself, which is the active hormone, unless you know how much Reverse T3 there is because that can interfere with the active hormone. So you have to look at the ratio of active to Reverse T3.

## Mouth Sores and Peanuts

**Patrick Timpone:** Here's an email that says after eating peanuts, his mouth cracked and he had inflammation lesions. A lab said he had fungus/candida. Was he just allergic to peanuts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That could be. But when it lingers for a long time, there could be several things. A nutritional deficiency might have been co-acting with the allergy. A lot of B-vitamin deficiencies can make sores around the mouth. Inflammation in the intestine can activate viruses to break out inside the mouth or on the lips. Benzocaine ointment, which you can get at a drugstore, happens to be an antiseptic as well as an anesthetic and will often clear up a little skin problem, whether it's a virus, germ, or fungus.

## Thyroid Supplement Brands

**Patrick Timpone:** Lindsay says she has low thyroid and is on 120mg of Nature-Throid but still experiencing many symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a particular brand of thyroid doesn't work, I think it's good to change brands. Armour Thyroid is fairly reliable. There's a synthetic called Proloid S which is an old established brand available in many countries. Cynoplus is made by companies related to the ones that make Cytomel. Cynoplus is very similar to Nature-Throid and Armour, but being synthetic, it lacks some of the potential allergens that the natural thyroids might have.

## Diabetes and Tryptophan

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the ideal diet for Type 2 diabetes? Also, I'm taking 1000mg of L-tryptophan at night for sleep. Do you recommend I discontinue this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, discontinue the tryptophan. There are articles on my website explaining how unsaturated fats are an essential problem in causing diabetes and sugar is not a problem and has been used as a cure. Getting the right diet and making sure the thyroid function is optimized are the basic things. Aspirin is well known to help regulate blood sugar and lower inflammation problems associated with diabetes.

## Acne and Rosacea

**Patrick Timpone:** Stella says: "I keep getting acne. I sweat in saunas and take chlorella, but still have issues."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid and Vitamin A are the basic things, but the skin and the intestine are very closely connected. You want to make sure you aren't eating any foods that aren't well digested or that irritate your intestine.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about using the far infrared sauna and niacin together for rosacea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Niacin sometimes refers to nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid happens to increase your histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandins, all of which are inflammatory. I don't think it's good for anyone to take nicotinic acid other than as occurs in food. Niacinamide is a form of that same vitamin (B3) that is active in cells and doesn't release those inflammatory materials.

## High Prolactin

**Patrick Timpone:** Brenda writes: "Could you please ask Dr. Peat about natural ways to reverse high prolactin levels? I recently started taking Progest-E."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes progesterone does help, but thyroid is the basic thing. Tryptophan and serotonin happen to turn on a trigger that increases prolactin and TSH; they tend to go together. If your thyroid doesn't respond adequately to the rising TSH, it isn't able to lower the prolactin. Without thyroid, sometimes increasing the salt in your diet and using a Vitamin B6 supplement can correct the prolactin.

## Sleep, Cortisol, and Nighttime Snacks

**Patrick Timpone:** Carl in Urbana is in his 70s. He tried a high fat diet (70%) and stopped feeling cold, but now he seems to be in an adrenaline state early in the evening. He wakes with a higher temperature and pulse rate, then cannot get back to sleep. He asks: "Since my cortisol state is the highest in the morning, would it be best for me to avoid any foods that would stimulate insulin production in the morning?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's normal. The parasympathetic system increasing at night lowers your blood sugar, and that increases adrenaline. Finally, during the night, it will increase your cortisol so that almost everyone has their highest cortisol of the day at dawn. That's because darkness is very stressful. Cortisol is protecting us against all of those inflammatory stress processes that develop during the night.

If you can keep the adrenaline and cortisol lower by what you eat at bedtime or even snack on during the night, that helps. Having some fluid in the night helps to keep your blood thin and circulating so that you are less likely to have a stroke from the high cortisol when you wake up. It's good to start with orange juice, for example, to get some fluid and minerals into your blood in the morning and to get the cortisol down.

**Patrick Timpone:** What would you drink in the middle of the night?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you're having a sleep problem, maybe juice or sugared milk. Even chicken soup—something that appetizers. A good chicken consommé with plenty of salt will lower your adrenaline.

**Patrick Timpone:** The salt lowers the adrenaline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Low salt is very often responsible for serious problems such as insomnia and hypertension.

**Patrick Timpone:** And again, foods that lower adrenaline and cortisol at night would be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk and honey or sugar. Fruit, oranges, tropical fruits, and gelatinous things such as consommé.

**Patrick Timpone:** Bone broth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You don't want to use marrow bones because of the high iron content. You want the joints that have the tendons and cartilage attached.

**Patrick Timpone:** So tailbones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tail is all joints, so that's very good. You want the cartilage and tendons, not the hard bone with the marrow in it.
