## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** Well, here we go. It is the third Tuesday, and that brings us to a time when we're grateful to have the lovely and talented Dr. Ray Peat on the air. He is a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He started working with hormones back in 1968 and wrote his dissertation in 1972. He has a great newsletter that comes out a couple of times a month. Dr. Peat, good morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** How are you doing there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good. It has started raining. Winter weather is setting in already.

**Patrick Timpone:** You're in Oregon, right? You get a lot of rain there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The weather has been pretty variable, but we're back to the old continuous rain. It looks like the ocean is warming up, and when that happens, we get extra rain; humid air condenses. The nighttime rain is traditional Northwest weather, but we had been changing over the last 30 or 40 years until it looked more like a Midwest climate—summer rain and drier winters. But I think we're back to the old rain in the winter night.

## Weather, Volcanoes, and Carbon Dioxide

**Patrick Timpone:** I saw with the Farmers Almanac, they use sunspots and they're predicting a cold and woolly winter this year for a lot of the country. We'll see how accurate that is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the sun and the submarine volcanoes are really the important thing changing the weather over the long term, rather than carbon dioxide. The Pacific is really pretty full of volcanoes that actually are warming the ocean, and they have cycles like sunspot cycles.

**Patrick Timpone:** So they put out a lot of heat down there and we don't really know when they're spitting up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And they're teeming with primitive life forms that can live at extremely high temperatures.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the ocean warms and that causes all kinds of things to happen in the jet stream and weather changes more dramatically.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it changes the ocean currents.

**Patrick Timpone:** It's hard to imagine that carbon dioxide is the devil. Don't we want to keep more carbon dioxide in us by not breathing so fast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of the anti-climate change people gets up on a box and lectures in London with a little sign that says, "Carbon dioxide is the gas of life."

## Milk and Tissue Regeneration

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Ray Peat is probably one of the few well-known, well-credentialed people that "got milk." You've been drinking milk for a long time now and you do good with it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There were times, like when I was living in Mexico City, when it was hard to get good milk. The rich people would send their maids out at dawn to buy up all of the good milk. So for three or four years, I went very light on milk. But the rest of my life, I've been a big milk drinker. Gallon a day.

**Patrick Timpone:** You're still doing a gallon a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, about two and a half quarts average now.

**Patrick Timpone:** We had an Ayurvedic doctor on a couple of weeks ago, Dr. Marianne Teitelbaum. She says dairy is perhaps the most misunderstood of all food groups. She writes: "The ancient doctors said that every food you eat spends three to five days in each tissue before progressing to the next... The only exception to the rule is milk. It nourishes all seven tissues in one day." Do you think that's accurate, going through all the tissues like that in one day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think some of that is historical metaphor, but there is some basis to it undoubtedly. It's now known that every tissue has its rate of protein turnover. As your nutrients change, the food you eat guides the turnover of the proteins so that you get proteins suitable for the type of food you're eating.

Every tissue has its own rate. Bone is extremely slow to turn over most of its substance. Your liver is very fast; the skin and intestine are extremely fast—just a few days and they're completely remade. The heart has a slower rate of protein turnover. But everything, including the mitochondria, is turning over constantly at its own rate.

In general, the faster a tissue turns over because it's kept warm, well-nourished, and unstressed, the better. High stress will make you turn over your thymus gland, muscles, and skin very fast, but in a destructive way. But in a good, warm, well-fed condition, you do have constant turnover and renewal of your tissues. It's like a streaming; new cells are being born as the old ones are being eaten up.

**Patrick Timpone:** Ayurveda has always been a big fan of boiling the milk. They say it helps with fat absorption and gets rid of bugs. Do you find any benefit in boiling milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Outside of Mexico City where they have cows or goats, that's the custom. Everyone puts a big pot of milk on in the morning and brings it to a boil. Usually, they skim off the fat that rises and make special dishes out of that.

**Patrick Timpone:** Would there be any benefit to our listeners who get organic grass-fed milk at Whole Foods to boil it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Surprisingly, the damage nutritionally is very small. It oxidizes some of the vitamin A and a tiny bit of the vitamin C. But milk is still basically the best source of all of the nutrients for the number of calories and protein in it. It has all of the nutrients except iron.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about A1 versus A2 milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was little we had a Holstein, and then when I was about eight or nine we got a Jersey. I don't really see any difference. I think a lot of it is just marketing to sell something for a higher price.

**Patrick Timpone:** Ayurveda says goat's milk is a little better choice than cow's milk. Do you agree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My own preference is for cow's milk just because I'm more familiar with it. When I was young, the neighbors had goats and their milk was very strong-smelling, so I learned to prefer cow's milk. But if you handle the goats right, the goat milk will taste as good as cow's milk.

## Muscle Maintenance and Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** You are 83. What has been your experience keeping your muscles from sarcopenia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I noticed after about 10 years of just sitting and studying, my shoulder muscles were smaller because I wasn't working regularly. However, my leg muscles have stayed huge. After not going skiing for 10 years, someone told me my leg muscles must be getting weak. I tested myself doing one-legged sit-ups. Every 10 years I would do 10 one-legged sit-ups and didn't notice a significant dropping off with time.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you do any other exercise regularly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, just every 10 years I would test myself.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you still like orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. When good stuff is available, it should be thoroughly ripened. The commercial stuff, they are used to selling unripe oranges. If they get unripe oranges, they add acid to it. The acid etches the enamel off your teeth. So ripe oranges are safer in every way.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you would want to rinse out your mouth with clear water after orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Clear water, maybe even baking soda if it's very acidic.

## Baking Soda and Carbon Dioxide

**Patrick Timpone:** What do you think about taking baking soda regularly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know people who do as much as a teaspoon two or three times a day and think it improves their endurance and strength. But even a fourth of a teaspoon two or three times a day helps reduce inflammation. I know people who used to get swollen legs when taking a long airplane trip; when they took a teaspoon of baking soda in water before getting on the plane, they stopped having the swollen feet.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is happening metabolically there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The sodium lowers your aldosterone very quickly. Aldosterone is a general stress hormone that tends to go up with cortisol. Aldosterone causes a shift towards inflammation and fibrosis. Chronic elevation leads to heart and circulatory disease. So, the chronic intake of a little extra sodium has an anti-stress effect, keeping your aldosterone lower.

The bicarbonate part is quickly changed. There's an enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, that changes carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and back. At the surface of your cell, when you're losing sodium through your kidneys, your cells change bicarbonate into carbon dioxide, which is more soluble in the living cell. It goes out of your blood into your cells.

It amounts to the same as breathing a little extra carbon dioxide or failing to hyperventilate. Low thyroid people hyperventilate and blow away the carbon dioxide they should be keeping. So the supplement of baking soda is imitating, to a degree, normal thyroid function—keeping your cells more charged with carbon dioxide.

**Patrick Timpone:** Fascinating. So low thyroid folks tend to breathe more?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Relative to how much oxygen they need. The oxygen requirement is very low in a low thyroid person, so they don't need to move very much air. A quart of oxygen will last a low thyroid person maybe minutes, where for a high thyroid person it would be gone in seconds.

## Thyroid Function and Testing

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you put much stock in taking the temperature to gauge thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you're producing energy at a high rate, you're maintaining your blood sugar level because you're using the sugar efficiently. The hypothyroid person wastes sugar at a terrible rate because they aren't using oxygen properly. If you're using sugar efficiently, you don't experience hypoglycemia, so you don't produce very much adrenaline. Your stress level is low.

**Patrick Timpone:** An email from Beth: "Do you think fluoride and chloride in tap water and bromide in breads are having a major effect on our thyroids?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I didn't know they were still putting bromide in bread, but if it's there, it should be avoided. Regarding fluoride, I was using a supplement of T3, the active thyroid hormone. When I would go to an area with fluoridated water, I would get a migraine headache. A glass of fluoridated water is enough to knock out a day's portion of the active thyroid hormone.

**Patrick Timpone:** Cynthia writes: "I take 60mg of natural thyroid every day. My TSH levels are normal. Does Dr. Peat think that if I just keep doing this, my thyroid will never be able to make what it needs on its own?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen several people who were hypothyroid who, when they took the amount that brought their oxygen consumption up to the right level, had recovery of their own thyroid function and could stop taking it. The supplement restored their anti-stress metabolism, lowered the adrenaline and cortisol, and allowed the tissue to start metabolizing by itself.

However, usually a person's body is loaded up with anti-thyroid substances—polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) built right into the structure of the cell. The average person in their 20s or 30s usually benefits from taking a supplement for at least a few years until they can change the composition of their body.

**Patrick Timpone:** If one is taking thyroid meds, what's the role of taking supplemental iodine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Foods such as milk and eggs always contain thyroid and iodine. Animals can't produce eggs and milk if they're very hypothyroid. Since food technology has started using iodine, there hasn't been an iodine deficiency zone in the US. If you take two or three times the amount needed, you start interfering with the function of the gland. Taking half a milligram per day chronically is enough to increase the incidence of thyroiditis and eventually thyroid cancer.

## Fish and PUFAs

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you think smoked salmon is a good food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's nutritious, but you can overload on polyunsaturated fat if you eat salmon all the time.

**Patrick Timpone:** There are PUFAs in salmon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, a lot of PUFA. The cold water fish eat algae, and the algae is the source of the PUFAs.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you prefer warm water fish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far as it's available. But there are some low-fat fish that come from cold waters. Cod and sole are the lowest fat fish that I know of, and I think they're safer than salmon if you're going to eat fish every week.

## Vasovagal Syncope and Shock

**Patrick Timpone:** Mona asks about Vasovagal Syncope. She wants to know what, besides the stressor, causes the vagus nerve to react.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid people tend in that direction. The history of shock became a major aspect of physiology a little over a hundred years ago. One of the pioneers was George Washington Crile. He showed that stimulating the vagus nerve was the basic signal for turning on shock.

What happens in shock is that signals are sent to all of your body cells, turning off the ability to use oxygen. It imitates death. When a person in shock is cut, their blood stays bright red because they aren't using the oxygen. It's like turning off the thyroid in a nervous way.

People generally compensate for that exaggerated activity of the vagal nervous system by pumping out extra adrenaline. Their adrenal glands become overactive. Surprisingly, many people are running with both sides of their autonomic nervous system running at an extremely high rate. If something interferes with their production of adrenaline, they drop into the vagal state and move towards shock or fainting.

**Patrick Timpone:** What did Crile do to lower the surgeries at his clinic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Supplementing thyroid, basically. Things they were calling thyroid cancer were just minor conditions he could turn off by giving them a full replacement dose of thyroid. He understood that TSH was driving towards thyroiditis and cancer. He would give usually three or four grains of Armour thyroid—sufficient to lower the TSH to zero.

**Patrick Timpone:** Three or four grains seems like a high dose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Two grains was the average dose for a middle-aged person, but sometimes to have good functioning, people took three, four, or even five grains.

## Diagnosing Thyroid Issues

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you lower the adrenaline and vagal response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ideally, use the oxygen consumption test. But you can make a good guess by taking your temperature and pulse rate before getting out of bed, and then again an hour or two after eating.

Low thyroid people often run on high adrenaline, which rises during the night. Adrenaline speeds your pulse at dawn; cortisol raises the temperature. So you might wake up with a normal 75 pulse and 98-degree temperature. But food lowers your adrenaline and cortisol. Often, these people will drop to a 55 or 60 pulse rate and 96 or 97-degree temperature at 11:00 AM. That tells you they are super low thyroid.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the ideal would be an hour after eating, around 11 AM, to have a 98-degree temp and higher pulse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. 80 or 85 is a good pulse rate in the middle of the day. Temperature should be 98 or 98.6.

**Patrick Timpone:** How does dopamine play into this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dopamine is similar to the adrenaline or sympathetic nervous opposition to the shock tendency. It's the body's balancing factor for serotonin. You want to keep your serotonin down and under control, and then your dopamine will take care of keeping things in balance.

## Diet Questions: Marmalade, Malabsorption, and Calcium

**Patrick Timpone:** What's more effective: eating a whole orange, drinking its juice, or eating marmalade?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The marmalade has the extract of the peeling, which has therapeutic things like naringin and naringenin—major protective factors. The added sugar is an anti-stress factor that supports your thyroid. Ideally, the juice is best, but marmalade acts as a kind of medical substitute.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener experiences malabsorption and can't gain weight despite eating thousands of calories.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known people who were very skinny eating 3,000 or 4,000 calories a day. When they supplemented thyroid, their calorie requirement dropped in half, and they put on muscle. Thyroid is an anabolic hormone. If it's deficient, you're running on adrenaline. Your cells can't retain magnesium, so they waste energy making ATP that breaks down immediately. Supplementing magnesium helps, but you need thyroid to retain it.

**Patrick Timpone:** Cindy asks about Hashimoto's. She's been told not to use natural desiccated thyroid because the body will attack it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The autoimmune condition is an excited, inefficient state. If TSH keeps rising, it drives the gland harder until it causes thyroiditis. The immune system comes in to clean up the damaged cells. If you supplement enough thyroid to lower the TSH, you stop producing the antibodies. The condition corrects itself after several months.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is pearl powder a good source of calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, pearls are made of calcium carbonate. That is the best supplement, along with eggshells and oyster shells.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about fish bones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a calcium source, but it is calcium phosphate. Phosphate has an excitatory effect. Most people are overloading on phosphates from meat, grains, and legumes. Calcium carbonate is more effective.

## Sleep and Stress

**Patrick Timpone:** How long do you sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the weather and food, but 7.5 to 9 hours. Usually, I wake up during the night and have some milk and sugar or orange juice to lower the stress. Having milk at bedtime lowers stress hormones.

**Patrick Timpone:** What kind of sugar do you use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pure white sugar is the safest. Honey is good, but if the bees eat something you're allergic to, you can react. Maple syrup is nutritious for minerals, but the heating process creates allergenic byproducts.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about using a red light at bedside for stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Shining red light on your blood anywhere in your body has a de-stressing effect. It penetrates very well. Also, an air ionizer running during the night is good because negatively ionized air activates your lung's ability to destroy serotonin.

## Protein, Stomach Acid, and Longevity

**Patrick Timpone:** Is hydrolyzed collagen powder as effective as gelatin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Gelatin lacks the toxic amino acids tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. Hydrolyzed gelatin is just short peptides and is fine.

**Patrick Timpone:** How important is thyroid for stomach acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid makes carbon dioxide. You use carbonic acid to energize the production of hydrochloric acid. So low thyroid usually means low stomach acid and slow digestion.

**Patrick Timpone:** Many Catholic monks lived past 100 on bread and water. Do you think their lack of movement conserved their carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are records of people living to 130 or 150 in the Caucasus and the Andes. These are high-altitude areas, which helps retain carbon dioxide. They also eat simple diets with milk and cheese. Meat is a pro-aging food because of the high phosphate. I think high phosphate is one of the life-shortening things.

## Gluten and Grains

**Patrick Timpone:** What is your take on gluten sensitivity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Seeds have plant defense systems. The worst toxins tend to be put in the seeds to block digestion. Gluten itself can block digestive processes and cause inflammation. However, if you let the enzymes activate the seed—like in sprouting or leavening—the toxins are inactivated. Leavened bread is basically detoxified.

**Patrick Timpone:** So gluten sensitivity is real?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's an objective thing.

**Patrick Timpone:** If someone wants to do sprouts, what is best?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are all vastly more digestible than the seeds, but they should be well-cooked. A fully sprouted bean or grain develops at least twice as much protein value as the original seed.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, are you focused on any particular research right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm trying to put together a systematic picture of how serotonin fits into stress and aging. I think intervention to lower serotonin is going to be one of the most productive things for reducing sickness and age-related degeneration.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks for being here. We'll see you in about a month.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
