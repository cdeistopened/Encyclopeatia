## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** On the third Tuesday of each month, we're honored to have Dr. Ray Peat, PhD, University of Oregon, with his specialization in physiology. He started his work on hormones in 1968 and his dissertation was in 1972. He has been working in this field ever since. He has taught at the university level and writes many different articles. Dr. Ray Peat is in Oregon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I am in Eugene, about 60 miles from the coast and 100 miles south of Portland.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are you doing any particular research right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The last few weeks, I've been particularly interested in why life expectancy is decreasing now in the US—the government is finally admitting it. That is on top of the rapid increase in autoimmune disease, degenerative disease, and cancer rates and mortality increasing in younger people. I've been looking for explanations for that.

## Autoimmune Disease and Antibodies

**Patrick Timpone:** Regarding autoimmune issues, is the basic principle correct that the body gets an infection—a virus, bacteria, or fungus—and the immune system actually attacks its own tissues while trying to get after the infection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the classic standard story. I don't think so. For example, in studies on animals trying to duplicate that process, they give them a viral infection of the brain that increases antibodies, just like in multiple sclerosis and other human diseases. They find that if they prevent those so-called autoantibodies—if they block the cells that produce them—the animal dies. The autoantibodies are actually there repairing tissues.

I've seen this in people with very high auto-thyroid antibodies. It is a common thing now to have chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland with high antibodies. Very high Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) causes inflammation of the gland, and the immune system is attempting to clean up, similar to the way it does in a viral infection of the brain in animals. The immune system needs those antibodies as part of a tissue cleanup process.

If you go back to the Nobel prizes in immunity with Ehrlich and Metchnikoff, Ehrlich worked for the chemical drug industry and created the antibody theory of immunity. Metchnikoff was an embryologist; he saw the immune system as a process of maintaining the structure of the body and removing damaged tissues so that the body remained entire and healthy. You can see that process happening in the thyroid, or if you injure cartilage. Your body will produce autoimmune antibodies, but it's a process of removing damaged tissue so the cartilage will be restored.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the body is doing what it's supposed to do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, preservation and restoration.

**Patrick Timpone:** If you go to a doctor and they see thyroid antibodies, they treat it as an autoimmune issue. You're saying the research shows that is what the body is supposed to do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are some terrible drugs they put people on chronically to suppress or kill the cells creating those antibodies. However, for about 50 years, it's been clear from animal research that anti-estrogen is an extremely powerful factor in disrupting the immune system and creating inflammation. Women have several times the incidence of autoimmune diseases—five or possibly ten times as much thyroid inflammatory disease as men. That's because estrogen is suppressing the restorative part of the immune system and activating the inflammatory part.

**Patrick Timpone:** If you were giving advice, would you just leave that alone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over the last 40 years, I've seen many women with that condition. If their doctor will give them a full replacement dose of glandular thyroid hormone over a period of five or six months, those antibodies fade away.

**Patrick Timpone:** That would be desiccated thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, desiccated thyroid or Thyroid USP.

## Vaccines and Inflammation

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In just the last few weeks, I've run across two women who, during their pregnancy, went for a checkup and were given a vaccination against their preference. Almost immediately, their blood pressure and blood sugar went up. They were diagnosed with preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. One woman was sure the vaccination had brought it on. She developed rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and found she had lupus-typical antibodies. She was diagnosed with SLE (lupus). They wanted to put her on immune system killing drugs, but she was skeptical. She started taking thyroid and progesterone and changing her diet. The arthritis and lupus antibodies faded away. I think in probably any case of autoimmune antibodies, if you remove the sources of inflammation, the antibodies will fade away after six or eight months.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there any case in the literature showing where the immune system is actually harming the body, like we've been told with arthritis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are hundreds of papers supposedly demonstrating that, but there are also hundreds of examples of people who recovered from those so-called autoimmune diseases because the body took care of the infection that was the original cause, or the hormone deficiency leading to the inflammation.

## Lactic Acid and Stress

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the white blood cells are slightly poisoned by a bad diet and your thyroid hormone doesn't provide the energy, then there tends to be quite a bit of lactic acid in circulation. Maybe only 50% above average, but that's enough to start the inflammation process. By increasing energy production, you lower the lactic acid and reduce the basis of the inflammation. With the lactic acid removed, oxidative metabolism can energize the cleanup process.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are the causes of high lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The basic general cause is anything that shifts you over to having free fatty acids circulating in your blood. Any kind of stress that runs into a limitation of energy capacity will break down the fatty acids in your tissues and put them into your bloodstream. This can keep the organism running for weeks eating its own tissues, but when fatty acids are circulating, they block the ability to oxidize glucose.

When you aren't oxidizing glucose, you aren't producing as much carbon dioxide. That lack of carbonic acid inside the cell allows the cell to shift over to the production of lactic acid. The healthy cell oxidizes glucose, which produces a lot more carbon dioxide than oxidizing fat does. That higher carbon dioxide suppresses glycolysis and lactic acid production.

**Patrick Timpone:** In simple dietary terms, what do we do unknowingly to increase this lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ideally, you would get all of your energy from carbohydrates—sugars or starches—and not have to rely on burning fat. Stress turns on fat burning, and that turns on background lactic acid formation.

## Ketosis and Fat Consumption

**Patrick Timpone:** Isn't that the whole pitch on ketosis, that you are burning fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you make an argument by doing a particular set of experiments, you can control the frame of reference to make your point. If you advocate ketone-based brain energy, you shift your argument to make lactic acid a virtue rather than a menace. For example, medium-chain triglycerides oxidized by the astrocytes (connective tissue of the brain) cause them to produce a lot of lactic acid. If you see lactic acid as a virtue for energy, that seems to support the fat diet.

**Patrick Timpone:** It sounds like cherry-picking information.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. There is a whole line of publication saying lactic acid feeds the brain and makes you athletic, but really, the background shift towards lactic acid metabolism is the essence of stress, inflammation, and degeneration.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are the big producers of lactic acid stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Too much fat in your diet.

**Patrick Timpone:** Even good animal fat or butter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You could eat so much butter that it can have that effect. However, when you eat butter, the highly saturated fat (stearic acid) has an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect because it is so stable. Fish oil, safflower oil, and soy oil have so much highly unsaturated fat that they are spontaneously oxidizing even before reaching your bloodstream. It's the oxidized fat molecules in fish oil that will temporarily produce an anti-inflammatory effect by poisoning your immune system.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about pig fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the pigs were eating good stuff, like apples, their fat would be just like butter.

**Patrick Timpone:** Did I hear you say that sugar energy from carbs is preferable to meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meat should provide the protein, which is essential, and vitamins and minerals. But meat has a very high content of phosphate and almost no calcium in proportion. Phosphate imitates the stress condition. When you are under stress and break down ATP, you liberate phosphate. If you eat too much meat without calcium, you start having an average condition of over-excitation.

## Calcium, Phosphate, and Parathyroid Hormone

**Patrick Timpone:** So you could do too much meat and not enough dark greens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cooked greens are the richest source of calcium. Cows eat greens, so milk is a very good source of magnesium and calcium.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why doesn't the calcium end up in the arteries?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the phosphate excess that pushes calcium into your arteries and out of the bones. This is closely related to inflammation and immune failure. Phosphate out of proportion triggers your parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH specializes in moving calcium out of your bones into the blood to balance the phosphate.

PTH mobilizes calcium by blocking oxidative metabolism and creating local lactic acid production, which breaks down the bone. This happens anywhere in the body exposed to PTH. If turned on chronically by high phosphate intake, it becomes a chronic block to energy production. This leads to generalized lactic acid formation. In soft tissues, the dominance of lactic acid in the presence of phosphate de-energizes the tissue and allows calcium phosphate crystals to form as the mitochondria die. The lactic acid shifts the pH of the cell so the crystal becomes insoluble.

**Patrick Timpone:** What blood test connects high parathyroid hormone to this issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High TSH, aldosterone, and the angiotensin system all go with parathyroid hormone. But the most often identified feature is low Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps shift the ratio in your body towards calcium and away from phosphate. Vitamin D, or high calcium intake, turns off the parathyroid hormone. Eating lots of calcium will prevent calcification of the soft tissue.

## Sun Exposure and Aging

**Patrick Timpone:** Is taking a Vitamin D supplement the same as being out in the sun?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is better to be in the sun. Eventually, when your tissues have assimilated the calcium and Vitamin D, you become resistant to the sun. It is the de-energized tissues liberating fatty acids that make you sunburn and age in the sun. In rabbit experiments, they fed one batch corn oil and the other saturated fat. The rabbits on the corn oil diet got prematurely aged skin when exposed to sunlight; the others did not.

## Sugar, Insulin, and HGH

**Patrick Timpone:** I have an email arguing that sugar lowers Human Growth Hormone (HGH), and since HGH is good, sugar ages the body. They also argue insulin causes aging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lowering HGH is one of the great advantages of carbohydrate, sugar, or starch. Growth hormone is a stress-related hormone. It rises when blood sugar is low and liberates free fatty acids, tending towards diabetes. If you give an excess of growth hormone, it imitates most of the degenerative features of diabetes. Animals that spontaneously lack growth hormone live about twice as long as ones with normal growth hormone.

**Patrick Timpone:** So high HGH levels are pro-aging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pro-aging and pro-diabetes. Experimenters removed animals' pituitary glands and replaced cortisol and thyroid, but not growth hormone. The animals lived twice as long.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about metabolic syndrome, where carbs raise insulin and cause inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is basically caused by eating too much fat, not enough carbohydrate. You can create it very quickly with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA).

## PUFA Accumulation in the Brain

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Butter and coconut oil have about 3% bad fats (PUFA). Chronically, you accumulate and store these PUFAs because you preferentially oxidize saturated fats—they are safer and don't destroy mitochondria. You store PUFA in your tissues.

A newborn's brain is almost free of polyunsaturated fats. By age 10 or 12, the brain shows high accumulation. After age 20, when growth stops, the concentration of PUFA increases steadily for the rest of your life. They are preferentially stored and built into the brain tissue. They tie up cholesterol, making it insoluble. It's like ashes or clinkers building up in your brain throughout the lifespan.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are the popular PUFAs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fish oil, safflower, cottonseed, corn oil, soy oil. All the things that make good paint and varnish.

## Milk Intolerance

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener in Seattle gets constipated even from raw grass-fed milk.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What the cow eats shows up in the milk. If the cow is fed something the person is sensitive to, like weeds in the pasture, it causes inflammation. I've known people who tried five or six brands. Sometimes they settle on ultra-pasteurized milk, which is basically cooked until sterile. Lots of people find they can tolerate that without constipation or asthma symptoms.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you have to find a source that works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I tried one famous organic milk and got sick. I looked up their farm; it was downwind from a stinky factory. The cows were breathing that air. The good taste of the milk should be the most reliable guide.

## Reversing Damage and Lifespan

**Patrick Timpone:** How much damage can be undone if one starts living healthy late in life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blood vessels and the brain deteriorate in proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated esters of cholesterol. Estrogen makes the balance worse; progesterone helps the balance. I think prolonged dominance of progesterone tends to reverse those brain and blood vessel changes. That is part of the function of the immune system—to break down damaged tissue and let new cells form.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the potential human lifespan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The official view accepts 122 as the maximum. But I've seen reports of people living much longer. A man in Florida was documented at 135. A man from Peru was 184. In England, "Old Parr" lived to 152. He was autopsied by the best physician in England, who found nothing wrong with his tissues.

## Island Foods

**Patrick Timpone:** If you were on an island and could only take three foods, what would they be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cheese, tortillas, and oranges.

**Patrick Timpone:** Cheese, turkeys, and oranges?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cheese, tacos, and orange juice.

**Patrick Timpone:** Turkey is a fairly neutral food though, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Like chicken, they tend to feed them grains, so their fat is very unsaturated. If you eat the leanest parts, like the breast meat, that's pretty good food.

## Bread and Gluten

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you eat bread?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why not?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 45 years ago, I liked to make bread. I would soak it for about 12 hours. The long soaking period increases the protein and practically eliminates the gluten. I found that was very digestible. A slice of regular bread would disturb my sleep, likely because of the gluten.

**Patrick Timpone:** What do you make of gluten sensitivity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gluten has a string of amino acids with the same pattern that estrogen activates in the intestine. Like estrogen, it can activate inflammation just by that pattern the immune system recognizes as a signal of stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** But people have eaten bread through history.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They did it in the traditional way of letting it soak for hours. Or, in Asia and the Western Hemisphere, they used ashes (alkali) in the dough. This increases niacin and decreases tryptophan, making it chemically much safer and non-inflammatory.

## Hypoglycemia and Heart Issues

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about the link between hypoglycemia, lactic acid, and heart conditions like AFib.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the mitochondria are damaged, usually by fat, you tend to produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. That is many times less efficient than oxidizing sugar. You are producing lactic acid and consuming sugar at a high rate but not getting the energetic benefit. To get maximum energy, you use sugar at an extremely high rate and have trouble keeping blood sugar steady.

## Pulse Rate and Thyroid in Athletes

**Patrick Timpone:** An athlete asks: I have a low pulse (60) and breathe 5-6 times per minute, but good body temp. Is this okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Endurance exercise can slow your metabolism by reducing the thyroid. The tissue itself can become more efficient. People at high altitudes adapt their tissues to resist shifting to lactic acid. Endurance athletes may have a similar adaptation. Coffee drinking does something similar—increasing efficiency without going into lactic acid production.

However, if a person starts with a thyroid problem, they produce too much lactic acid just at rest. The lower your thyroid, the lower the threshold for going into lactic acid production. High altitude and good thyroid function both help you do work without producing lactic acid.

## Optimal TSH Levels

**Patrick Timpone:** What TSH number would you like to see?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 0.01. It's okay if it's 0.1.

**Patrick Timpone:** Really? Not 1, 2, or 3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A large population survey showed that populations with 0.4 and down were essentially free of thyroid cancer. I've never seen anyone free of symptoms who had a 2.0 or higher. Very few people at 1.5 are fully functioning.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are symptoms of a TSH of 2 or 3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some kind of inflammatory problem somewhere in the system. Insomnia, for example.

## Heart Health and Tachycardia

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener in their 80s has supraventricular tachycardia (pulse 200) and ablation is recommended. What can they do to balance things out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Checking Vitamin D would be the first thing. If Vitamin D is low, you are subject to the excitatory effects of phosphate. Check calcium and magnesium in the diet. Those are the heart-stabilizing nutrients.

Also, selenium from seafood. One good meal of seafood per week provides the required selenium, which lets your tissues form the active thyroid hormone (T3). Without selenium, tissues can't produce the T3 needed for heart metabolism.

Finally, avoid a salt-deficient diet. 40 years ago, the dogma was that high blood pressure went with high sodium. Research showed that people with hypertension were actually deficient in both calcium and sodium.

## Estrogen in Men

**Patrick Timpone:** A 70-year-old male has estradiol levels of 15.1 pg/mL. Is that good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is a very fine, low estrogen level. Typically, aging men get more and more estrogen, but 15 is good.

## Microwaves

**Patrick Timpone:** What about cooking in a microwave?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It causes the same changes that boiling meat does. It has the virtue of not scorching things on the outside like a baking oven. On average, the nutrients are safer by microwave, but it doesn't taste as good.

## Parasites and Calcification

**Patrick Timpone:** Do microscopic parasites cause calcification?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just get your immune system revved up. Keep your body temperature around 98.6 during the daytime and your oxidative metabolism going well. The immune system can take care of those.

## Spices and Supplements

**Patrick Timpone:** Are there safe spices?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They all have toxic levels. Chili pepper can burn you and cause serious damage in excess. Clove is a pretty safe spice. Cinnamon and black pepper are safe.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about chlorella, spirulina, or diatomaceous earth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't like any of those. Occasionally they have been found to be contaminated with toxins. If you could have each batch tested, maybe, but otherwise no.

## Sugar and Dental Health

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener says sugar and juice increased dental cavities.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is good to rinse your mouth after every intake because of the acidity. The quality of saliva varies according to hormones. Some cavities start inside the teeth when you are under stress—"stress cavities"—because the tooth removes minerals under stress.

## Rapid Fire Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** Is bovine desiccated thyroid okay for autoimmune thyroiditis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, both bovine and porcine are good.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is A2 milk good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I tried it for a few months. It was okay, but I prefer low-fat milk (1%).

**Patrick Timpone:** Suggestions for reversing lactic acidosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Baking soda, lower fat intake, good thyroid function, and Vitamin D.

**Patrick Timpone:** What do you think of Shilajit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know anything directly about it, just what I've read.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks so much for being here. Merry Christmas.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
