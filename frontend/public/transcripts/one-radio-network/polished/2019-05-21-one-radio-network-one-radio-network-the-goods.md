## Introduction: Milk and Natural Toxins

**Patrick Timpone:** Hello, Dr. Peat. Good morning. How are things with you, sir?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pretty good.

**Patrick Timpone:** What did you have for breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just coffee and milk.

**Patrick Timpone:** Coffee and milk. It's funny, there are so many people out there who say you shouldn't drink milk. They say we are the only mammals that drink milk after weaning and it's going to kill you. All of that hasn't killed you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nope. It's actually one of the cleanest foods available because the cow filters it through many layers. Chemically, the rumen processes the toxins out of the plant material. When you eat the same leaves that a cow eats, you absorb many allergens and toxic materials that the plant puts into its leaves defensively to kill bugs or anyone who would damage them. There are chemical pesticides naturally in plant material.

Seeds are the most precious to the plant. Their whole generation depends on seeds being viable and not being eaten by microorganisms or large organisms, so they have the most intense toxins and blockers of the digestive system. When you look at the chemicals in seeds, it turns out that they block the digestive enzymes of mammals and insects, but they don't affect that same type of enzyme in plants. It is obvious that they are directed towards defense against being eaten. Unless you have very sophisticated lab equipment, you can't separate the good stuff from the toxins. However, the cow's rumen is such that the microorganisms do the chemistry of eliminating the bad stuff and increasing the good stuff.

**Patrick Timpone:** At the local store, they have a few choices of organic milk. I just got some organic half-and-half. That's pretty fun to drink; getting a lot of good fat in there.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I use cream or half-and-half in my coffee.

## Milk Varieties and Ruminants

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the deal with A2 cows? Is a Jersey A2 cow easier to digest? And talk about the difference between goat milk and cow milk.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a big difference between the milk of different species, but they still have in common the rumen milk. Camels, goats, sheep, cows, and llamas—that type of animal produces the safest milk. The reason people don't drink pig milk or bear milk is that they don't have rumens, so all the plant toxins go into their milk.

**Patrick Timpone:** Explain what rumens are exactly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's an extra stomach where the vegetable material goes and soaks at body temperature. This favors the growth of microorganisms which ferment and degrade the plant material, basically digesting it with protozoa, fungi, and bacteria. All of the major types of microorganisms get a chance to break down the plant material. Then, that broken-down material goes through the regular digestive system analogous to what we have. People, bears, and pigs don't have that extra stomach, so whatever they eat goes with minimal filtering into the bloodstream.

## Animal Testing and Circadian Rhythms

**Patrick Timpone:** You mentioned pigs, and I often think about how they do testing on animals like rats and mice. Is it viable to do something on a mouse or rat and say, "That's the way it is for humans too"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One great difference between mice and rats and humans is that they are mainly nocturnal animals. If the experimenter is working in the lab in the daytime and they keep the rat or mouse awake to do their experiments, they are creating intense stress in the animal. To do something analogous to what happens in a human, the experimenter would have to stay up all night to work with the nocturnal animals, and they don't do that. So, automatically you have to question what time of day they were doing their experiments.

Very often, if someone is selling a product, they will try out very different animals so they can get the kind of results they want. In the 1960s and early 70s, the estrogen industry was testing their products on dogs and found that estrogen would damage the dog's bones. By using a species that lives oppositely—in the nighttime rather than daytime—they found that estrogen would strengthen the bones of mice and rats. Conversely, cortisol, which weakens dog and human bones, stimulates the growth of bones in these nocturnal animals. They choose the animal that is specific to get the result they want.

**Patrick Timpone:** I've often thought that these mice and rats are probably surrounded by a huge amount of electromagnetic fields and weird lights that aren't good for them. That would put a fly in the ointment regarding the accuracy of the results.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They commonly use a very standardized controlled diet, but there are prejudices built into what they call the standard diet. Often they will put in 6% of so-called "essential fatty acids," which aren't at all essential. When someone experiments by leaving out those essential fatty acids, they get "super rats" or "super mice"—very resistant to poisons, trauma, shock, venoms, aging, diseases, and diabetes. All kinds of biological damage is less in the animals that are deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids. But since they build those fats into the standard diet, when they compare an experimental diet to the standard diet, they are already biasing the experiment. They are making sick animals their reference.

## The History of "Essential" Fatty Acids

**Patrick Timpone:** I wonder who came up with the term "essential fatty acids."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was Burr. He and his wife, around the late 1920s and early 1930s, got the idea that maybe fats were like a vitamin. Even though two or three research groups at big universities had demonstrated that you could have a totally fat-free diet and the animals actually lived longer, the Burrs created a fat-free diet.

At that time, most of the B vitamins hadn't been discovered. They were feeding a diet deficient in unsaturated fats, but also deficient in several B vitamins. They said they had created a deficiency disease in which the animals got sore tails and rashy, cracked skin around their mouths. They called this the fatty acid deficiency symptom.

However, 15 years later, a Texas research institute discovered Vitamin B6. They created the Burr essential fatty acid deficient animals, gave them only Vitamin B6—with no fat—and cured the deficiency symptom. In 1945 or 1946, they proved that there was no essential fatty acid.

Meanwhile, the petroleum industry was working on how to make plastics and paint. Synthetic plastics were being engineered, and seed oils like linseed oil, which had been the bulk of plastics and paints, were replaced by petroleum chemistry. There was no longer a paint and plastics market for linseed oil and cottonseed oil. They had to figure out some way to dispose of their product, so they decided to sell it to the public as a food.

The same thing happened in the 60s and 70s with fish oil. Fish oil had been primarily used as varnish or fuel because it hardens on exposure to oxygen, like linseed oil. Fish processing factories were throwing away the skin and fatty parts when canning salmon, causing horrible pollution in bay areas. The EPA told them they had to figure out something to do with their waste material to reduce pollution. Thus, fish oil as a health food came on the market.

**Patrick Timpone:** Let's just give it to the people; they'll eat it. But wasn't fish oil used early on, like in the 1800s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For hundreds of years it was known to make a good varnish. Whale oil was a major fuel oil for lamps.

**Patrick Timpone:** I've heard that parents gave their kids cod liver oil around 1900.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I got some when I was a kid. That was only the liver oil, and it is very different from regular fish oil. What they are selling now isn't from the liver, so it has practically no vitamin value—very small contamination with Vitamin D and A, but not enough to be therapeutic like the liver oil.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is cod liver oil healthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't have other sources of Vitamin A and Vitamin D. It started in Norway where the winters are so dark. People found that they benefited from it.

**Patrick Timpone:** But we can get plenty of A in our food and D in the sun, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Eggs are a good source of Vitamin A, and getting sunlight is the best way to get your D.

## Hydration, Salt, and Edema

**Patrick Timpone:** What is your take on water? We hear about drinking half an ounce of water for every pound of body weight. What does your research show regarding dehydration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salt is one of the important factors in keeping us hydrated. In the 50s, drug companies came out with diuretic pills to make you lose water, and they sold them to pregnant women to prevent water retention. It turns out that is a very bad idea. During pregnancy, you have to retain water in your bloodstream and expand your blood volume tremendously to take care of the growing fetus and new systems of blood vessels.

What retains water in the bloodstream is largely the protein albumin. But albumin doesn't retain water unless there is an associated cloud of sodium atoms attached to the negative charges on the albumin protein. The combination of sodium and albumin retains water within the system. If you take a diuretic that makes you lose sodium, the water that goes with the sodium reduces the blood volume and reduces the ability of the albumin to keep water from going out into your tissues.

Without enough sodium, the albumin itself goes out of the blood vessels into your tissues, creating a kind of edema and swelling. It isn't the typical pitting edema; it is very firm, resembling the myxedema of hypothyroidism. It is caused by the lack of sodium needed to keep water in the proper compartments. You dehydrate your circulatory system but waterlog the functioning tissues.

In experiments, researchers gave women with toxemia of pregnancy—who had great water retention and high blood pressure—extra salt instead of diuretics. With this supplement (in one case six grams a day, in another 20 grams), their blood pressure quickly came down to normal and their toxemia was cured.

**Patrick Timpone:** So for the edema or puffiness around the ankles, what is the difference between the kind where you press in and it leaves an indentation, and the other kind?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have protein leaking out of your blood vessels into the tissue cells, that protein is slow to move under pressure. If it is from salt deficiency causing leakage of albumin, or from hypothyroidism causing accumulation of sugar-containing protein, either of those makes the water stick around your tissue cells. It doesn't get easily pushed back into your blood vessels. Once it gets into your feet by gravity, it doesn't all come out during the night. Simple edema will correct itself during the night, but when you stand up, if you don't have enough sodium and albumin, your blood loses water into your lower extremities.

**Patrick Timpone:** So people with puffy ankles could try taking more salt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You want to make sure your protein intake is adequate. When you increase your protein, make sure you are not overloading on phosphate. Phosphate is now being recognized as a kidney toxin. In kidney failure, too much phosphate is one of the most toxic things. Meat, fish, and seed proteins are the highest in phosphate. Leaves, milk, and cheese are the lowest.

## Muscle Building and Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** Here is an email from Eric. He wants to build more muscle. What are some foods that help muscle building?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Protein is essential, but again, you have to make sure it is not excessive in phosphate. You need B vitamins, Vitamin D, and Vitamin A to make protein. However, you don't want too much carotene. Carotene turns off your metabolism and blocks testosterone production. You want natural animal Vitamin A, such as in eggs and liver—though not too much liver either, because that can be toxic to your thyroid. But it is needed for making muscle protein and steroid hormones like progesterone and testosterone.

**Patrick Timpone:** We had a guest who said guys could safely use a little bit of progesterone from wild yam. Do you agree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you take the amount a woman would use for menopause replacement (about 30 milligrams a day), that can antagonize a man's testosterone. But if you take 5 or 10 milligrams, that is in the range normal for a man. By reducing estrogen production in a man, it can make the testosterone effect much more potent. Both testosterone and progesterone are capable of reducing the synthesis of estrogen. However, testosterone can be converted into estrogen. If you don't have progesterone and thyroid hormone, you are liable to convert your testosterone into estrogen and lose the masculinizing effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are beans estrogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many years ago, they found that sheep would miscarry if they grazed on leguminous plants like clover, alfalfa, beans, and peas. They all have enough estrogens to act as a birth control pill for sensitive animals.

Beans also have other toxins designed to make them indigestible. People have developed technologies for cooking them properly. If you soak beans (or grains) for a day at room temperature, enzymes start sprouting. Those enzymes activate detoxifying processes. Soaking a bean detoxifies it quite a bit. Then, very long cooking until it softens further reduces the toxicity.

**Patrick Timpone:** So there are ways to make beans and grains digestible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but they are still a very low-grade protein compared to leaf protein. The quality of protein in a leaf is similar to milk, or about 70% as perfect as egg yolk protein. Bean and grain proteins are way down on the scale, around 5% to 10% in quality. For muscle building, they function as nothing more than energy. You might as well eat sugar as beans.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about grass-fed whey protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Whey isn't quite as nutritionally balanced and safe as casein (the solid part that goes into cheese), but it is a good quality protein. Compared to beans, it is extremely good.

## Vascular Health and Lab Tests

**Patrick Timpone:** Does Dr. Peat have insights on leg vascular insufficiency or lipedema?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Swelling of the legs and feet creates pressure from the tissue outside the blood vessels, making it hard for blood to get through. If you have extremely high fats in your blood, that increases viscosity. Interestingly, having high albumin increases the fluidity of your blood, while fibrinogen makes blood thicker. So, fat and fibrinogen increase viscosity; albumin and salt make blood more fluid.

You can correct fibrinogen and fat content by lowering stress. That includes avoiding excess phosphate and ensuring good thyroid function and Vitamin D levels. Those are the three most neglected anti-stress factors: low thyroid, low Vitamin D, and excess phosphate.

**Patrick Timpone:** Kevin emailed regarding a high PSA test. He doesn't want to take drugs. What is your opinion on PSA testing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1980s, they decided this antigen was a sign of prostate issues. Actually, this protein is a defensive reaction to irritation. Cancer does lead to an increase, but the protein itself has an anti-cancer protective effect.

When PSA testing came on the market around 1990, there was approximately a 50% increase in deaths from prostate cancer over the next few years. That is a general effect of diagnosis leading to aggressive treatment. Later, a journalist asked prostate specialists what they would do if they had prostate cancer. Almost all said they would do nothing—"watchful waiting"—because they knew treatments like estrogen and surgery weren't curing it. When this became public, the mortality rate dropped. It's okay to diagnose it if you don't treat it aggressively just because of the diagnosis.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the connection between pumpkin seeds, zinc, and the prostate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually people eat pumpkin seeds well-salted, and I think increasing salt is beneficial for many people. Generally, thyroid function decreases with aging or stress. When your thyroid is low, you lose salt in your urine. When you lose sodium, aldosterone increases. Aldosterone causes high blood pressure and fibrosis of the heart and blood vessels.

When I worked in the woods, the cook put a tablespoon of salt in our morning porridge because he knew we lost salt sweating. I would get white salt crystals on my eyebrows. The body adapts by lowering aldosterone so salt is lost easily. After I told the cook I was on a low-salt diet and stopped eating the salty porridge, I immediately stopped sweating crystalline salt. The adrenals adjust quickly. But in aging, thyroid deficiency causes sodium loss. The salt craving in most people is biological. You can correct it by correcting thyroid function, which helps you retain salt efficiently.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener in Switzerland asks what laboratory tests you advise for a health assessment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors are often reluctant to do the patient's requested tests. Vitamin D should be done regularly. Free fatty acids are extremely important but rarely done; stress increases them. The common tests that are beneficial are Progesterone, DHEA, Pregnenolone, Testosterone, TSH, and thyroid hormones. Prolactin is a good indicator of stress. Lactic acid is another test that should be done more often; a rise in lactic acid indicates something is going wrong.

Also, the Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) test reflects your status of phosphate, calcium, and Vitamin D. It is rarely done but extremely relevant. PTH, like aldosterone, poisons the function of your mitochondria.

## Vitamin A, Gut Health, and Lipofuscin

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there anything to the recent talk about Vitamin A toxicity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1973, drug companies were releasing synthetic Vitamin A and found professors to tell stories about toxicity to make people fear natural Vitamin A. One popular story is about explorers eating polar bear liver and their skin falling off. Polar bear liver likely contains toxins from algae blooms concentrated through the food chain (fish/seals), which got blamed on Vitamin A.

In animal experiments, huge doses of Vitamin A caused brain deformities in chicks, but if they gave them a moderate amount of Vitamin E, the Vitamin A was no longer toxic. At very high levels, Vitamin A stimulates its own oxidation. Vitamin E prevents this breakdown.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about reducing endotoxins from gut bacteria using garlic, ginger, or cloves?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those have their own allergens. It is safest to use fibrous foods. Rinsed bran from wheat or oats, cooked mushrooms, or bamboo shoots can stimulate the intestine and chemically reduce bacterial population. Raw carrot is another; it grows in a microorganism-rich environment and powerfully reduces endotoxin production. Olive oil and vinegar are bactericidal, so a carrot salad with dressing is effective.

**Patrick Timpone:** Adam Bergstrom asks: Does oxidative stress cause lipofuscin accumulation in autism, or is it the other way around?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's both. Lipofuscin lowers oxygen tension, creating an oxygen deficiency that imitates stress. This low oxygen catalyzes the degradation of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). Excess Vitamin A without Vitamin E interacts with unsaturated fats to lead to accelerated lipofuscin production. Vitamin E prevents lipofuscin.

## Bread, Cancer, and Carbon Dioxide

**Patrick Timpone:** Would soaking wheat work for making healthier bread?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. I experimented with soaking wheat for 12 to 24 hours. Ordinary bakery bread would cause gas, but I could eat a whole loaf of my homemade soaked bread with no problem. Soaking activates enzymes that turn the storage gluten into growth proteins, doubling the protein value and making it digestible.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a fungal connection to prostate or breast cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most tumors contain fungus because the immune system is deranged. The fungus produces estrogen, stimulating growth. If you view a tumor not as a mutant cell but as a wound that is failing to heal, treatments like biopsy, chemotherapy, and radiation just add to the organism's problems.

A healing wound can look identical to cancer structurally. The cancer lacks something to get beyond that stage of healing. One thing it lacks is carbon dioxide. Simoncini's use of baking soda provides carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide stops the production of lactic acid (the Warburg effect) and allows the tissue to mature and heal. Low thyroid, low calcium, and low sodium limit the ability to make enough carbon dioxide.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it reasonable to take a little baking soda?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Athletes find endurance is increased with baking soda. Even a quarter teaspoon in water can help. It provides carbon dioxide which re-acidifies the cell and stops it from producing lactic acid.

## Milk Proteins and Thyroid Medication

**Patrick Timpone:** What about A1 versus A2 casein milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a difference in peptides, but I haven't seen convincing research that it is important for health. Our digestive systems are usually efficient enough to break them down to amino acids, which have no endocrine effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are new digital X-rays less dangerous?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They claim they are more sensitive, but in practice, they take more pictures, so the exposure is likely the same. CT scans deliver hundreds of times more radiation than a chest X-ray. Medical X-rays are a major cause of heart disease and breast cancer.

**Patrick Timpone:** Jill asks: If someone has a problem converting T4 to T3, are they better off taking Armour or Cytomel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For most people, combination products like Armour are reliable. Women have much more thyroid disease than men because estrogen interferes with thyroid function. Estrogen increases cortisol, which blocks the conversion of T4 to T3. Therefore, most women with a thyroid problem are deficient in T3. Progesterone helps because it blocks estrogen formation and the anti-thyroid effect of cortisol.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener stopped taking Armour when starting probiotics, but their blood pressure went up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When thyroid function is low, TSH is high. TSH has a pro-inflammatory effect that creates circulatory problems. Hypertension is often caused by low thyroid (and high TSH). Correcting the low thyroid often cures the hypertension.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks for spending time with us today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
