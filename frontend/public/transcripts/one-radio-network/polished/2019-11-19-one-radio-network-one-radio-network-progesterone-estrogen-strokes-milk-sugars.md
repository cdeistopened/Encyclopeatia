## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** Well, welcome back. It is the third Tuesday of the month, and that brings us to Dr. Ray Peat, who’s been at this nutrition healing game for a very long time. Dr. Ray Peat, good morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** How are you, doc?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm very good.

**Patrick Timpone:** How's your life these days? What have you been doing? What are you most passionate about? What have you been thinking about in your world of health and healing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm working on a newsletter on progesterone for this month. Something I've been working on for 50 years, but there is always something new to think about really.

## The Estrogen Industry and Progesterone Myths

**Patrick Timpone:** What could possibly be going on with progesterone that would warrant that kind of attention for so long?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Partly that the industry is reverting to some of the old myths about it. The estrogen industry. People discover the dangers of estrogen and that moves interest towards progesterone use. Then the estrogen industry has to defend itself because it's a multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. So, they subsidize studies to make people worry about the risks of progesterone.

They're starting to say that anything estrogen has been known to cause for a hundred years, well, really, progesterone is involved in it. It's distracting attention from the dangers of estrogen. In the absence of any real information, they're just putting the thought out there that if estrogen does it, maybe progesterone is really involved somehow.

**Patrick Timpone:** So when we talk about estrogen, are we speaking of the supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, no, just for the supplements. The industry got started when someone synthesized a very simple chemical that triggered the whole fertility cycle in mice and rats in the 30s. Someone was thinking about the fact that chimney sweeps got cancer of the scrotum in the 18th century from getting soot on them and not bathing. That led to someone putting soot on rabbits and finding that it was very carcinogenic.

But they noticed that besides causing skin cancer, it triggered estrus in the female rabbits. They did extracts of soot and found that there were hundreds of estrogenic substances in soot.

**Patrick Timpone:** In the soot which came from the wood, I guess.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. You put a piece of cold metal or porcelain in the flame of a candle burner and carbon spontaneously condenses at high temperature. Methane is a single atom of carbon with hydrogen. When it burns—like if you have a cloud of natural gas and it explodes—it creates a cloud of soot. This results when the single atom of carbon surrounded by hydrogen condenses spontaneously into very symmetrical six-membered rings.

Some of the cyclic molecules are huge, and being very large and heavy, they stick to each other and form these gobs of black material. Each molecule has this pattern, six-membered rings, which happens to be analogous to the steroid molecule. The steroid molecule has three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring. When those don't have the proper oxygen atoms added in the right places, they act as estrogen. So you can get a million different estrogenic substances just from soot.

The estrogen industry realized that everyone could have a patented unique molecule and sell it as estrogen, which they called the "female hormone" because it can be found in the ovary of a pregnant animal. They advertised that they were selling the female hormone, which they said would make women more fertile.

They convinced even Harvard doctors—two of them did studies giving this, basically a soot derivative, diethylstilbestrol (DES), to pregnant women, claiming that it prevented miscarriage. But the animal studies in the 1930s and early 40s had all demonstrated that every kind of estrogen creates miscarriage or stillbirth.

My thesis advisor was one of the early researchers showing that as you increase the dose of estrogen, you can create an abortion or miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. A very tiny dose will prevent implantation. A larger dose will cause miscarriage at the first week, a bigger dose at the second week, and so on. They knew that estrogen caused miscarriages, but they were selling it to the public to prevent miscarriage simply because they could.

## Estrogen, Progesterone, and the Uterus

**Patrick Timpone:** What's the biggest piece of misinformation regarding these two hormones that most people believe is untrue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of doctors still refer to progesterone as the "pregnancy hormone." Just a couple of weeks ago, someone said her doctor told her that since she had her uterus removed, she didn't need progesterone because progesterone is only the pregnancy hormone. That is an absolutely ridiculous idea.

Going back to the 1940s, doctors were taught to sell estrogen to get pregnant. They knew that estrogen causes cancer of the uterus. That was one of the early demonstrations of soot—that of estrogens of all sorts, the most sensitive organ is the uterus, then the breast, then the brain, then the lungs.

Then someone discovered—actually about 1945 it was already discovered—that progesterone prevented uterine cancer from estrogen. So they said, if you take estrogen and don't want uterine cancer, then you should take progesterone with it. But then the profitable thing was to do a hysterectomy. Everyone by the age of 30 or 35 was being urged to have a hysterectomy. Without the uterus, they said there's no need for progesterone.

But in the 1930s, the ovaries were found to produce hundreds of times more quantity of progesterone than estrogen. Estrogen is really a minor hormone from the ovary. In experimental surgery, people have demonstrated that when they measured the amount of estrogen coming out of the ovary as a control, they measured the blood coming out of the monkey's arm and found that the arm was producing as much estrogen as the ovary. So the idea of estrogen as an ovarian hormone is really out of context. Every tissue of the animal produces a large amount of estrogen when it's under stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** So laying it out as you have been, you can see how there's so much confusion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors are still being told if you don't have a uterus, you don't need progesterone. The brain is one of the biggest sources of progesterone. The placenta in pregnancy, the corpus luteum of the ovary, and the brain. The brain contains 10 times the concentration of progesterone that the blood serum does. The skin is another major source. When you take out the ovaries, you're putting an extra load on the brain and the skin to maintain the concentration of progesterone.

## Menopause and Hot Flashes

**Patrick Timpone:** What's the best advice you can give to our lady listeners regarding these two hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're very likely to be told, still 60 or 70 years after it was proven false, that estrogen is a lifelong female hormone. But old men rival women of the same age in the amount of estrogen being produced because it's a stress hormone produced by tissue of any sort under stress. Question the claim that aging is evidence of a need for more estrogen. Old tissue increasingly tends to make estrogen, but the opposite is true.

Progesterone failure is the primary thing that brings on menopause. The monthly surge of progesterone produces the monthly cycle. When that stops, what is left is a surge of estrogen which is no longer balanced by progesterone.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is that a sign of health in general, the longer a lady menstruates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Patrick Timpone:** And the hot flashes? People have said that that's due to possible toxicity in the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is stress. Even in the 20s or younger, I've known women having hot flashes that were resolved when they took thyroid or progesterone to prevent the stress.

One of the immediate chemical changes that produces the hot flash in the skin is a surge of nitric oxide causing vasodilation. Unopposed estrogen is a powerful activator of nitric oxide. I'm convinced that unopposed estrogen is the cause of the hot flashes.

Doctors looking only at a blood test of estrogen will say no, because at menopause a woman's estrogen in the serum is very low. But this has been very competently studied. If you take a bit of tissue and compare it to the serum, the tissue has 10 or 20 times more estrogen than the serum. What makes the difference—what can raise the estrogen in the serum—is progesterone.

When you have a normal cycle with progesterone, the progesterone does eight or ten different chemical actions causing the tissue content of the estrogen to decrease. As it decreases in the cell, it enters the bloodstream on its way to the kidneys and liver to be excreted. In the absence of progesterone, those changes don't happen. So the estrogen stays inside the cell at a concentration much higher than in the blood.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why do progesterone levels go too low?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For pregnancy to be safe for both the mother and the baby, the placenta must produce a huge amount of progesterone every day. But when the woman or animal is under stress, the stress changes the pituitary and all the other glands to avoid pregnancy. A stressed animal of any sort would be less likely to survive if it got pregnant. So the trick is that pregnancy is prevented by stress for the safety of the mother.

## Progesterone for Men

**Patrick Timpone:** Many feel like a little bit of progesterone cream helps to keep testosterone levels better for guys. What's going on there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard that from several men over the years. My first experiences experimenting with progesterone was that it would stop my whiskers growing for a couple of days because a good dose of it blocks hormones that could interfere with pregnancy. Progesterone puts everything down the middle. When it's high in pregnancy, you don't want any stray hormones disturbing the pregnancy.

**Patrick Timpone:** So it's not necessarily a testosterone builder or an anabolic thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it just blocks the stress. If you get it at the right level, you don't have enough to block the testosterone, just enough to block the stress and leave your own testosterone.

**Patrick Timpone:** You sound like you wouldn't recommend guys mess with it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Most of the men that I've known who used it, it did shrink the penis and stop whisker growth. It shrinks the penis temporarily because testosterone is maintaining the circulation. The right amount of testosterone maintains a certain tone in the exit vessels, allowing a considerable amount of blood to stay there, even in the passive state.

**Patrick Timpone:** How would you know what just the right amount is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think only by trial and error. I've known men who had anti-testosterone symptoms with 10 milligrams, and others who felt an increase of testosterone with the same small dose.

**Patrick Timpone:** After all these years, do you have a milligram standard you would start guys at if they wanted to experiment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 5 milligrams.

## Early Research and Progesterone Effects

**Patrick Timpone:** How did all these people find you over the years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 70s when I started giving out samples of thyroid and progesterone dissolved in vitamin E, people got such tremendous results just giving it away to whoever happened by. They started talking about the amazing things that happened.

**Patrick Timpone:** What kind of experiences were they having?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One suicidal young woman, 21 or 22 years old, became absolutely suicidal every two weeks. Her husband brought her over and she was sobbing. I gave her a bottle of progesterone in oil and told her to go in the bathroom and spread it all over her body. She came out and within five minutes had stopped sobbing. The bulging veins on her hand disappeared. 40 minutes after putting it on, she was smiling. Exactly 45 minutes after putting the oil on, she said, "It's like night turning into day. I wish I could always feel this good."

## Calcium, Parathyroid, and Arteries

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: "You recommend 2,000mg of calcium per day. A concern expressed by other nutritionists is that calcium may not go to the bones, but into the soft tissue causing systemic damage. What are the physiological assumptions you are making?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know lots of doctors and nutritionists still have that idea. The parathyroid gland is constantly regulating. If you eat an excess of calcium and a moderate or low amount of phosphate, the parathyroid gland becomes very passive, especially if you have adequate vitamin D.

The parathyroid gland's main function seems to be to take calcium out of the bone and bring it into the blood. A side effect of taking it out of the bone is that it activates take-up by the soft tissue. Keeping the parathyroid gland as inhibited as possible leaves your bones unaltered.

When you eat an excess of calcium and have an adequate vitamin D level, the calcium passes right through your kidneys into the urine. But if your parathyroid is active, it can form stones on the way out.

Carbon dioxide is the factor that keeps the calcium in solution in the bloodstream and stable in the bones. When the parathyroid hormone is active, it forms lactic acid in the bone, and it's lactic acid that dissolves and removes the calcium from the bone. That same process happens in the blood vessels. Carbon dioxide keeps the calcium dissolved, but lactic acid precipitates calcium and forms hardening of the arteries and kidney stones. Keeping parathyroid hormone low and your carbon dioxide production high relative to lactic acid is what's going to keep bones strong and arteries soft.

## Strokes and Clotting

**Patrick Timpone:** Jerome asks: "I have a history of family strokes. What can I do to strengthen my arteries?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two main kinds of stroke: one in which a clot forms and plugs up the small arteries, and the other where a blood vessel breaks and leaks. Then there is a relatively harmless thing, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), where the arteries or capillaries close down because carbon dioxide isn't being produced.

**Patrick Timpone:** Let's talk about the clotting strokes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the United States, that's by far the most common type. It relates to serotonin. Excess serotonin increases when you're under stress, especially if you're hypothyroid. Hyperventilation raises the pH of your blood by blowing out the CO2. As the pH of the blood rises, your platelets lose the ability to bind serotonin. So serotonin rises in the blood.

Serotonin in the brain stimulates respiration and makes you breathe harder. If you're low in carbon dioxide to start with, it increases the release of serotonin into your bloodstream in a vicious circle. That's how an emotional stress can start the cycle in which the pH rises, serotonin is released from platelets, and activates your brain to breathe harder.

**Patrick Timpone:** So angst and tension could be a chief cause for these strokes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, on the background of a low thyroid function.

## Thyroid, Body Temperature, and Oxalates

**Patrick Timpone:** How powerful of a metric is body temperature for thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's almost the ruling factor. If you cool your body to 95 or 96 degrees Fahrenheit, it's essentially impossible to metabolize properly. It's a lot easier to get full oxidation all the way to carbon dioxide when you're in the body's proper temperature range.

**Patrick Timpone:** A doctor suggested that if your big toe is about 90 degrees using an infrared thermometer, that's an indication the thyroid is happy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Adrenaline is protective. When your thyroid is low, you increase adrenaline and serotonin. A primary function of adrenaline is to keep the blood flowing to your brain, lungs, and heart, and it will make your hands and feet get very, very cold. So the adrenaline takes the blood out of the extremities to keep things working in the core. If the room is warm, your hands and feet should be reasonably warm. When they're very cold, it means either that you're being frightened into high adrenaline or that your thyroid is inadequate.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: "What is the mechanism for how proper thyroid function and stomach acid break down oxalates? Does it matter how much oxalic acid is consumed?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you're eating enough minerals, the calcium oxalate is likely to precipitate in your stomach and intestine and not even be absorbed. I think the calcium and magnesium content of your food is protective by keeping the oxalate out of your bloodstream.

**Patrick Timpone:** I've been putting black cumin seed oil on my thyroid with a little DMSO and using a red light, and my body temperature has gone up about half a degree.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is able to catalyze oxidative metabolism. From the shape of the molecule, it looks like it would be a pro-oxidative, pro-thyroid factor.

## Diabetes and Sugar

**Patrick Timpone:** Jim asks: "I'm a 68-year-old man on Nature-Throid with healthy weight, no processed foods, but still cannot cure type 2 diabetes. What should I try next?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Getting a perfect, well-balanced diet is the first thing. Adequate calcium, a fairly high ratio of calcium to phosphate. Not too much meat, beans, or nuts because of the high phosphate. Milk, cheese, and cooked greens provide high calcium/magnesium and low phosphate. Vitamin D should be in the middle of the range, 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter.

Beyond that, you want to make sure your thyroid is good. Using carbon dioxide supplements—absorbing it through your skin or taking little bits of baking soda and water—will suppress lactic acid production. Diabetics talk about the sugar not being able to get into the cell, but that isn't true. It goes into the cell and is turned to lactic acid.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the insulin resistance thing is not the whole story?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress increases the liberation of free fatty acids from your tissues. It's the liberation of free fatty acids which get into the cell and block the ability of the cell to oxidize glucose. When glucose isn't being oxidized, it's likely to be turned into lactic acid.

**Patrick Timpone:** Adrian asks: "Does Dr. Peat believe the A1C blood test is a reliable metric to see if I'm taking too much sugar?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I don't think so. It relates very closely to sugar because it will be influenced by the breakdown of free fatty acids. The polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) break down into fragments that look like sugar fragments, but fats are much more oxidizable and toxic.

## Liver Health and Iron

**Patrick Timpone:** James asks about the best ways to improve liver health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good diet is the first thing. B vitamins are extremely important. Selenium is essential for being able to use the thyroid molecules to put it into the right active T3 form. And carbohydrate is very important.

**Patrick Timpone:** Trent asks: "I donate blood several times per year. What is the optimal serum ferritin blood level for someone age 70?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think ferritin is meaningful enough to worry about. Watching your hemoglobin level at the low end of the normal range is the safest place to be. Ferritin can go up and down according to inflammation. The percentage saturation of transferrin should be under 30.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the idea of giving blood to get rid of excess iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was the traditional idea, that it would prevent the accumulation of iron. But in the last several years, people are seeing that there are other things—"stressins," or substances released into the bloodstream during stress and aging. Getting rid of those has a slightly rejuvenating effect.

## Milk, Swelling, and Birth Control

**Patrick Timpone:** Elmer asks: "If I'm trying to lose fat, should we be drinking lower fat milk?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think milk is such an easy nutrient to get almost all of your nutrients that drinking two or three quarts a day is good for most people. But you don't want to drink that much whole milk if you aren't doing very hard labor to burn calories. So 1% is an average amount of fat for a person of average activity.

**Patrick Timpone:** Chris asks: "Why do feet swell up, especially when it is warm? I'm on two grains of natural thyroid."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's partly the shift of the nervous system. You let down your adrenaline a little bit when it's warmer. Adrenaline's function is to keep the blood up in your vital organs; when it's warmer you can reduce the adrenaline, and that relaxes blood vessels and lets any leakiness show up. I think it means that you're maybe not producing enough albumin in your liver or having some other effect of an unbalanced estrogen level. Estrogen makes blood vessels leaky and reduces the formation of albumin. Albumin working with sodium is what keeps the fluid in the bloodstream rather than leaking out into your feet.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are birth control pills estrogen manipulators, and are they dangerous?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 30s, they already knew that estrogen prevented implantation or caused miscarriages. They didn't want to sell a miscarriage pill. In the 50s, someone thought up the idea that it isn't acting on the uterus, it's acting only on your brain and pituitary to stop ovulation. If you can stop ovulation, you won't be accused of causing abortions.

**Patrick Timpone:** But that was fake news?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The first wave of them was causing sometimes fatal hemorrhages, often disabling strokes by causing clotting in the brain. They reduced the amount of estrogen by about a factor of 10 from the first wave. But the medical literature is still out there showing that depression, mood changes, movement disorders, and restlessness are associated with them.

## Miscellaneous Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** What percent of tryptophan ingested from food is converted to serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That depends on your level of stress. It can be very high when you're under stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is risk-taking involved in the state of learned helplessness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Serotonin turns on the stress system, but it can also turn off the adaptive things such as production of progesterone. You can break out of learned helplessness by increasing your energy. Thyroid is a crucial thing in stopping learned helplessness.

**Patrick Timpone:** What exactly is learned helplessness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The term relates to old studies where they convinced a rat that escape was impossible. The animal in that state would allow itself to drown very easily because it saw no use in swimming. But if they showed it some exit possibility, it in effect vaccinated it against stress so that when dropped into the water, instead of drowning in a few minutes, sometimes they would resist and swim for more than a day. It was a mental change.

**Patrick Timpone:** Would you talk about free will and determinism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think we are determined to have free will. It's part of our nature. Like the formation of soot molecules—extremely complex, organized, symmetrical molecules form spontaneously. The carbon atoms have an intrinsic ordering principle. I think that spontaneous tendency to improve things, to create order out of chaos, is where determinism affects free will. I think our inherent free will is intending to create high-level order.

**Patrick Timpone:** Ellen wants to know: As women get older, what are signs of low progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just about everything. Aging. Weakening bones, loss of elasticity in the skin, loss of moisture, stiffening of joints and arteries. Reduced curiosity and initiative. Less interest in adventure, more interest in security.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is titanium ceramic non-stick cookware safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Without seeing any tests, I would refrain from using it to cook anything acidic. Ceramics aren't necessarily acid-resistant. The more it's like a simple silicon glass surface, the safer it is.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is oral micronized progesterone equal to Progest-E in its effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The drug companies sell progesterone usually in an emulsion of peanut oil and micronized progesterone. As your bile emulsifies the peanut oil, very little of the progesterone goes into solution. Molecules released from the crystals will go directly from your intestine to the liver and will be attached to glucuronic acid, which quickly leaves in the urine.

When it's dissolved in vitamin E (like Progest-E), vitamin E enters in the form of chylomicrons, which enter the body through the lymphatic vessels, bypassing the liver. This lets the progesterone distribute through the whole system.

**Patrick Timpone:** James asks: "I don't have set meal times and follow my hunger signals. Is this negatively affecting my circadian rhythm?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't really think so. I think it's okay to eat whenever you feel like it. The experiments on mice claim that it's good to fast for a while, but mice are nocturnal animals. It's hard to extrapolate from rodents to people.

**Patrick Timpone:** Ian asks about the cause of vertigo.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A very common cause is toxic bacterial growth in the intestine causing a surge of serotonin, leading to a balance shift of water into your vestibular apparatus. That's probably 90% of the cases. The first thing to concentrate on is cleaning up your intestine.

## Conclusion

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thank you so much. What are you going to have for Thanksgiving?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Turkey or maybe a lamb roast. I'd like to mention a book that people can find online. It was written in 1905 called *Carbonic Acid in Medicine* by Achilles Rose. It has some very interesting stuff about the history of therapeutic use of carbon dioxide.

**Patrick Timpone:** Thank you. We love your work. Take care and we'll see you next month.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you. Bye bye.
