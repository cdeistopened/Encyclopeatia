## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Ray Peat is a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at schools all over the place, including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine. He started years ago with progesterone-related hormones in 1968 and has been working on both the practical and theoretical aspects of this work for a very long time. Dr. Peat, good morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** How are you doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are you really 85 revolutions around the sun?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, no. Yesterday I saw a thing on the internet saying I'm 83, but I'm really only 82. One place said it was 114.

**Patrick Timpone:** Who are some of your real heroes in the field of health, nutrition, and healing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I read lots of old books that the family had, early 20th century and mid-19th century. Lots of the people were not very well known, but there was a lot of good information in the medical culture that was pushed aside. Starting around the Second World War, the pharmaceutical industry really took over medicine.

One of my early interests was a doctor who wrote columns in the newspapers for many years, Walter C. Alvarez, a gastroenterologist. He was, in a way, pushing a conventional line. For example, the 19th-century doctors believed in food digestion poisoning—bacterial poisoning in the intestine. He wanted to disprove that, showing that toxins didn't cause headaches. To show that it was just a myth, he stuffed his medical students' rectums with cotton wads. All of those who were susceptible to headaches got a headache just from the cotton pressure. He said this disproves the idea that headaches are caused by toxicity in the intestine. But of course, that didn't logically prove anything, just that pressure is enough, and toxins often lead to pressure in the intestine.

A lot of Russians were showing the interaction of the nervous system with the intestine around that same time. "Nervism" was a 19th-century theory of medicine in Russia. They saw the nervous system as controlling sickness, so the interaction of the digestive system and the brain was a big topic of research. They showed that if you put a balloon in an animal's intestine and inflated it, nothing would happen if the animal's blood sugar was good. But if you lowered the blood sugar and inflated the intestine, it would cause all kinds of things: asthma, seizures, the equivalent of a headache, and vascular distortions throughout the organism.

The combination of energy in the form of blood sugar and stress in the intestine will cause that whole range of so-called psychosomatic ailments. Some French Canadians, following Hans Selye, showed that the immune system similarly interacts with the intestine and the energy supply. If you drop the blood glucose level, the intestine becomes extremely sensitive to allergens that otherwise wouldn't be noticed. The energy and the brain, which has the highest requirement for glucose as its energy source, are behind the psychosomatic and allergic ailments.

## The Mind-Body Connection and Learned Helplessness

**Patrick Timpone:** So it's fair to say there are many different components in the nervous system contributing to gut issues, including blood sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. About 20 or 30 years ago, some psychologists were demonstrating learned helplessness. Training the brain to believe that escape is impossible made the whole organism shut down. The heart would stop beating in a few minutes rather than a few hours if the animal was convinced that escape was possible. The whole organism is either energized or shut down by the perspective of what is possible. Insight becomes a life-saving matter.

**Patrick Timpone:** You can extrapolate that out and think of all the physiological things going on with people who feel trapped in their life, job, or relationship.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen that happen. Just with medical diagnosis, the doctor tells a person that they have an incurable disease and they pretty soon die.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it any surprise to you that we're so inextricably connected with everything that we think, believe, and feel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I never was committed to any particular so-called scientific view of the world. It all seemed perfectly reasonable to an ignorant kid looking at the world and hearing these different experiments. Scientific medicine always seemed like a closed, dogmatic way of seeing things. Since about the 1940s, the pharmaceutical industry has shaped medical ideas so that it's really an outlet for their products. You get a diagnosis, and then you can funnel the drugs in. Anything curative, like the old medical practice of giving people bran to cure constipation—like the Kellogg Institute—isn't profitable to the pharmaceutical industry.

**Patrick Timpone:** Isn't that how Kellogg started? His whole thing was constipation, wasn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the mid-19th century in England and France, the autopsy cause of death was often given as inflammation of the intestine. Now, having an inflamed colon is a very common thing in a dying person, but they don't think of it as the cause of death. It was people like Walter Alvarez who said, "See, it isn't toxins causing a headache, it's just the pressure." That took attention away from the intestine as a constant source of toxins and allergens. But it's really our most susceptible interface with the outside world. We're constantly putting these risky substances into our system.

**Patrick Timpone:** That's why some folks get constipated and get a headache. Those two tend to go together.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. And asthma attacks and seizures. When I was about 10, our dog found a coffee can full of bacon grease that had been saved to make soap. The dog liked the taste and ate the whole quart of bacon grease and had a seizure. That made Walter Alvarez's publication so interesting—to see a seizure brought on by eating fat. Lots of people had experimented showing that the intestine could trigger a seizure, headache, runny nose, or sore throat. Just about any symptom you can think of can be triggered from the intestine.

## Autoimmune Issues and Estrogen

**Patrick Timpone:** We have a question from Dennis: "I've heard so much about this classic autoimmune issue. Could Dr. Peat give us his theory on this autoimmune problem?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For a long time, people noticed that women have far more autoimmune problems than men, and about five times the incidence of thyroid disease. There is a very close connection. Estrogen sensitizes your immune system. It acts on your brain and your glucose supply. For example, it activates insulin secretion, but it shifts your metabolism away from glucose towards fat oxidation. That makes you less able to oxidize glucose, turning it to carbon dioxide.

In the absence of high production of carbon dioxide, you produce lactic acid. Lactic acid promotes inflammation. Starting with the fact that estrogen slows liver function by reducing the thyroid hormone, the slowed liver production shifts you into that lactate-favoring metabolism away from carbon dioxide. Lactate causes inflammation of everything. Autoimmune thyroid disease is just the tip of the iceberg. Once the estrogen slows your thyroid down and starts inflammation there, all of your other tissues are susceptible to chronic inflammation, ultimately leading to calcification or fibrosis—excess collagen production.

**Patrick Timpone:** And all this is cascading, starting from high estrogen levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Women normally cycle. For two or three days, there's a surge of estrogen around ovulation. Then, if they're healthy and well-fed, the ovary shifts strongly to progesterone production. The diagrams in medical books often show estrogen and progesterone on the same chart using a different scale. The production of progesterone is about 1,000 times greater than the production of estrogen in a healthy person, but they show them on the same graph misleadingly.

This little moment of dominant estrogen should be suppressed by a massive pouring out of progesterone for the rest of the month. But if anything interferes—like eating too much vegetable oil or starchy vegetables that are hard to digest—their energy level decreases so that they don't produce the normal amount of progesterone. It starts with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), where they don't have the energy and sense of well-being of the progesterone-controlled condition. In the absence of progesterone, everything tends to shift in an inefficient direction towards oxidation of fat rather than glucose. That takes a lot more oxygen. Every carbon requires two oxygens if it's fat, and only one oxygen if it's carbohydrate, which already comes with one oxygen. You get a double supply of carbon dioxide, in effect, when you're using sugar as a fuel. Carbon dioxide has a stabilizing, protective effect that suppresses inflammation and turns off lactate production.

## Protein, Liver Function, and PMS

**Patrick Timpone:** So if women change their diet, they could feel better during their periods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the short run, eating a lot of carbohydrate will make them feel better because it provides glucose. But at some point, their liver needs a good supply of protein to keep working. I've seen women eating 15 or 20 grams of protein a day, whereas an Army study found that even average or small women needed 100 grams of protein a day to work efficiently. Women are often told that 35 grams a day is fine, but competent studies show that 85 to 100 or more grams per day are needed for the liver to function well.

Just a protein deficiency makes the liver underproduce. In the 1940s, studies on prisoners who were starved noticed that when they were let out and given food, the men fairly often grew breasts in the first year. That was because their liver had been damaged from the prolonged protein and vitamin deficiency. The liver normally destroys or causes excretion of 100% of the estrogen reaching it. If you starve the liver for B vitamins or protein, the estrogen accumulates. So a man will grow breasts just from a prolonged nutrient deficiency. That happens in women, and that's a basic cause of PMS.

The estrogen industry, starting in the 1940s, convinced the government and the public that these PMS and menopausal problems were the result of a deficiency of estrogen rather than an excess. At the very same time, researchers were showing exactly how the liver keeps estrogen under control when your diet is good. The estrogen industry totally reversed that situation. They even sold estrogen to prevent miscarriage. All through the late 40s and 50s, doctors at Harvard were convincing doctors to prescribe estrogen to pregnant women. That created the DES (diethylstilbestrol) syndrome—cancer in the next generation.

**Patrick Timpone:** Was that whole syndrome blamed on the drug?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen. In the 1930s, my professor, Soderwall, was a student of one of the people who showed very early that estrogen causes miscarriage. He gave animals graded doses and showed that the number of miscarriages exactly corresponded to the dose of estrogen. So estrogen as a contraceptive or abortion producer was defined before 1940. But in 1941 and 1942, the estrogen industry started promoting it to *prevent* miscarriage—exactly 180 degrees opposite of what it does. That has created more than 50 years of total confusion. For 50 years, they prescribed estrogen to men with prostate cancer. It turns out that it is a major cause of prostate cancer. High testosterone men in middle and old age are relatively free of prostate cancer; the ones who develop it are the ones with lower testosterone and more effective estrogen.

## Gelatin and Amino Acids

**Patrick Timpone:** Does it matter if women get animal protein or vegetable protein to balance this out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does. Gelatin is one protein that is very safe because it lacks the three amino acids which can be very toxic if you're eating more than is needed: cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan. They are used for growth until you're about 20 or 25. After that, they are just needed for replacing skin. If you eat a young person's requirement of those amino acids when you're 40 or 50, they tend to promote overgrowth, inflammation, excitotoxicity of the nerves, and tumor growth. They are associated with shortening the lifespan. Gelatin lacks those, so it's a very safe protein to add to other proteins to balance it out.

**Patrick Timpone:** Like the Great Lakes gelatin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a good one. Gelatin is basically the stiffening glue that holds our other cells together. A lot of people are selling gelatin calling it collagen. Collagen is the raw form in your tissues; to buy actual collagen is very expensive.

**Patrick Timpone:** So if you want collagen, you should get it from pigs' feet and ham hocks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's a natural way to get it. Chicken backs, wings, and feet are traditional ways. When a person is sick, giving them a gelatinous chicken soup is therapeutic.

**Patrick Timpone:** And the excitatory amino acids are what again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. Glycine and proline are the protective, energy-providing, and stabilizing amino acids found in gelatin.

## Eggs and Cholesterol

**Patrick Timpone:** Jeremy asks: "I just love eggs. I might eat three or four a day. Is it okay?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They used to be the perfect food. I've seen the cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content analyzed in the 30s, 50s, and 70s. There has been a constant decrease in cholesterol content and a constant increase in PUFA content because of the feed. In the pork industry in the 40s, they found that highly polyunsaturated fats made the pig gain fat faster with less food. That spread to other branches of agriculture. Chicken feed has become more and more polyunsaturated.

**Patrick Timpone:** If our listeners have access to really good yard eggs, organic with no soy, is it a perfect food then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When I'm in Mexico and know where the eggs come from—chickens getting tortillas, vegetables, and bugs—I'll eat four or five eggs a day. It's okay to eat more. The cholesterol myth was created by the seed oil industry, especially cottonseed. People wanted to sell their product on the basis that it lowered cholesterol. Things that lower cholesterol generally cause cancer and degenerative disease.

In an experiment many years ago, medical students were fed eggs. It took 22 eggs a day to show an increase in serum cholesterol. At 15 eggs a day, there was no increase because their natural liver production of cholesterol was inhibited. The body recognizes it doesn't have to make cholesterol when it's getting that amount.

**Patrick Timpone:** Aajonus Vonderplanitz used to promote a raw egg diet. He claimed a dozen raw eggs a day could straighten out stomach problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen several people recover using that. One was a year-and-a-half-old kid, another a man about 70. Both had a diagnosis of leukemia. I suggested an eggnog or "Orange Julius" formula: egg, milk, sugar, orange juice, or vanilla. Both had a recovery. I've suggested that several times for lymphoma and leukemia.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a big difference between raw or cooking the eggs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been experiments showing that something in the raw egg yolk is germicidal and helps disinfect the intestine. That is somewhat decreased by cooking, but you still get almost all the benefit from a cooked egg. It's better to cook it as little as possible so the yolk is still runny because the polyunsaturated fat is easily oxidized by heat.

## Pork and Fat Quality

**Patrick Timpone:** Any issues with pork if it's well-tended?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For about 50 years, the Department of Agriculture called lard a saturated fat. They hadn't checked their figures since the 1930s. A more recent study showed that lard is about 32% or 33% polyunsaturated fats, so it ranks up with the worst of the liquid oils for oxidizability. When I was a kid, grocery stores had blocks of lard sitting out at room temperature like butter. Recently, I saw lard in a plastic bag looking like a liquid fat. That shows the change of diet on the fat. When the source of energy is mostly starch and protein, the animal turns it into mostly saturated fat. Solid lard stimulates your metabolism rather than poisoning it.

If you eat a vegetable fat that grows in the tropics, it will be more saturated because the temperature of the organism governs the saturation. Cocoa butter and coconut oil are highly saturated because polyunsaturated fats are extremely unstable at 90 or 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants producing those fats in the tropics would die of oxygen reaction poisoning.

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** An email asks: "Can Dr. Peat recommend foods for recovering from long-term inflammatory bowel disease causing hair loss, drop in lean body mass, and skin that doesn't heal?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoid things that produce inflammation. The basic things that amplify inflammation are polyunsaturated fats and the bacteria that feed on indigestible plant matter. We don't have enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin. If starches and fats are associated with those indigestible polysaccharides, they will feed bacteria in the lower intestine and cause the absorption of bacterial toxins like endotoxin.

Lettuce in a salad is an ideal bacteria food. If you are prone to inflammation, lettuce or undercooked vegetables are going to feed the bacteria that produce bowel inflammation. Overcooked vegetables are actually more nutritious than raw ones. Experiments with rats showed they couldn't live on raw vegetables but thrived on canned vegetables that were overcooked. A milk and egg diet is often therapeutic for colitis.

## Breast Cancer and Anti-Estrogens

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener's mom underwent a mastectomy and was prescribed an anti-estrogen medication which caused severe reactions. What is Dr. Peat's opinion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The anti-estrogen drugs have many effects other than suppressing estrogen. You can powerfully decrease estrogen production by inhibiting aromatase naturally. Cutting out polyunsaturated fats is key because they produce prostaglandins, which are the main force activating aromatase and estrogen production. Aspirin is a natural substance that blocks aromatase and is very safe to use in breast cancer. Progesterone is another.

## X-Ray Damage and Bone Necrosis

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener in Switzerland asks about bone necrosis in the jaw caused by X-rays. Can X-ray damage actually cause bone necrosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. About 30 or 40 years ago, I noticed a circle of white whiskers on my face where the X-ray gun had been used for dental X-rays. Right after that, I would get leukoplakia on the inside of my cheek. X-rays destroy vitamin A, E, and B2—the light-sensitive nutrients—first. These essential regulatory factors are destroyed in the bone because X-rays penetrate well.

Getting essential nutrients up would be the first defense. Vitamin D and calcium are anti-inflammatory and restorative for the bone. Keeping cortisol and prolactin down is important. Having energy come from carbohydrate rather than fats is protective. And again, aspirin keeps prostaglandin production down. An anti-inflammatory program protects against bone loss as well as cancer.

## Estrogen and Physical Appearance

**Patrick Timpone:** Being an artist, a listener asks: "If high testosterone gives men attractive traits, and high estrogen gives women attractive broad hips and narrow waists, what does Dr. Peat think about estrogen as a factor in attractiveness?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does increase fat on the thighs and hips when everything else is in balance. But if it comes at the wrong time, it is a masculinizing factor. It will shift a balance in an embryo towards male development. Progesterone protects the female against the masculinizing effects of estrogen. You have to have a generous supply of progesterone to keep down the cortisol, which is promoted by estrogen. If estrogen isn't blocked by progesterone, you get stress syndromes, including belly fat.

## Puberty and Thyroid Health

**Patrick Timpone:** A question about a 10-year-old daughter entering puberty with poor appetite, dental issues, and coldness. Should they measure thyroid or steroid hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's good to check her temperature and pulse rate. As estrogen starts rising after age 6, and especially 9, 10, and 11, the estrogen blocks the thyroid gland. In teenage girls, you often see puffiness at the bottom of the neck. The gland enlarges under the influence of estrogen because it's trying to produce hormone but isn't able to release it. Vitamin D and calcium work closely with the thyroid in sugar metabolism. Getting lots of milk, cheese, and eggs is important. Not a lot of high phosphate foods like nuts, beans, and meats.

## Turpentine

**Patrick Timpone:** What is your opinion on using pure pine gum spirits or turpentine internally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known lots of people who used it, and it isn't as dangerous as doctors lead you to believe, but you have to be careful because it can be irritating. I always painted with it and enjoyed the smell. The research has been biased against it by the pharmaceutical industry.

## Bioidentical Hormones and Cancer Receptors

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it okay to take bioidentical hormones if one has breast cancer that is ER+ (Estrogen Receptor positive)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The receptors just mean that the cell is able to respond to hormones. The presence of those receptors is almost always misinterpreted by doctors. When you have an irritation, the breast itself begins producing estrogen internally. You need to reduce that by reducing polyunsaturated fats and inhibiting it with aspirin. Progesterone inhibits cell division and knocks out the estrogen receptor. So where they tell you to avoid progesterone because you have receptors, the receptor actually means it's able to be *inhibited* by progesterone. Bioidentical estrogen is just as harmful as synthetic estrogen.

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Patrick Timpone:** What would you recommend for rheumatoid arthritis? This listener eats organic, bone broths, and cottage cheese.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With cottage cheese, make sure it doesn't have added lactic acid, as that is pro-inflammatory. Regarding bone broth, the collagen—which is the main benefit—is around the knobby end bones and joints, not the long bones. The long bone contains marrow which is rich in iron, and you don't want excess iron with arthritis.

I met a woman who was convinced her doctor was right to prescribe estrogen for her rheumatoid arthritis, yet she couldn't get off the couch. When she finally tried giving up her estrogen pills, she immediately recovered. Another woman with joint replacements used progesterone topically and her symptoms vanished. An Italian researcher named Cutolo has shown that estrogen is produced in the arthritic joint and the problem is to reduce the estrogen. Aspirin helps because it turns estrogen production down and progesterone up.

## Nanoparticles and Persorption

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you explain the connection between volatile organic compounds and nanoparticles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nanoparticles are efficient at activating inflammation, but larger particles—up to 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell—can pass through the wall of the intestine into the blood vessels. This process is called persorption. These particles can obstruct arterioles and kill a region of cells.

Plastic particles are getting into our food supply. The larger particles can be coated with volatile organic compounds, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are carcinogenic. They stick to the surface of particles and get carried into the bloodstream. This happens whenever you eat undercooked starch. Starch particles pass into the bloodstream unless they are in the presence of enough food to energize the intestine cells to keep them from being leaky. A leaky intestine isn't just holes between cells; it's that the individual cell is weak and becomes tolerant of particles passing through its substance.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the takeaway for avoiding this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Clothes are treated with silver nanoparticles that can pass through the skin. Toothpaste often contains particles. Salad dressings are thickened with fumed silica (glass particles) or titanium dioxide. Even if they aren't "nano," microparticles can still contain the pro-inflammatory nanoparticles. Processed foods are increasingly contaminated. For example, "food grade lubricants" containing Teflon microparticles are used on machinery and can contaminate food but don't show up on the label.

## Mercury Amalgams

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you recommend removing mercury amalgams for neurodegenerative issues?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they are old, they have probably released almost all of the mobile mercury. I think it's better not to mess with it. You're going to damage the tooth more by taking it out. In rat experiments, memory was impaired with each molar extraction because the nerves are closely related to brain function.

## Hormone Pellets (Caller)

**Patrick Timpone:** We have Brenda on the line. She's been using bioidentical estrogen and testosterone pellets for four years and feels great, but is confused by your stance on estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Testosterone makes everyone feel good, male or female. But women get the same effect from DHEA (the precursor of testosterone) and pregnenolone. Both will optimize your progesterone and testosterone without as much risk of excess estrogen. After age 35, fat tissues produce estrogen continuously rather than cyclically. Uninterrupted estrogen has a higher degree of cancer risk. Progesterone is normally produced cyclically, and the liver throws off the excess.

There's really no need to supplement estrogen because tissues start to produce it as they age. Testosterone has protective effects, but progesterone is more protective in aging because it can't be converted to estrogen, whereas testosterone can.

## Canned Milk vs. Fresh Milk

**Patrick Timpone:** How does canned milk compare to fresh milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It used to be that they soldered cans with lead, but I think they've revised that. Now, all you lose is a little vitamin quality and you have a little oxidized fatty material from the heat. It's a gradient from fresh raw milk to pasteurized, to ultra-pasteurized, to canned. Each time it loses a little value. I use pasteurized milk almost always.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are goat milk, kefir, and goat cheese good sources of calcium and protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

## Iodine and Thyroid

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener says taking iodine gives them energy, but heard you say it doesn't help the thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Iodine can interact with polyunsaturated fats in your body producing an anti-thyroid substance. I have a file of about 70 articles showing that increased iodine in the diet from iodized salt is correlated with increased thyroid disease and cancer. In some people, iodine has an anti-inflammatory value, but taken chronically in large amounts, it tends to have an anti-thyroid effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can it cause Hashimoto's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Male Hormones

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you explain how the male hormone system works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's simpler than female hormones because there isn't that powerful cyclic effect. Testosterone acts as an anti-stress effect for most of the lifespan. But if the thyroid is interfered with, a slow thyroid will shift you to the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. That's where degenerative problems start.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you recommend supplemental testosterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A pellet is probably better than an oily injection. Injections usually contain testosterone esters dissolved in vegetable oil with solvents like benzyl alcohol, which are toxic. I don't often recommend it because pharmaceutical forms provide huge excesses. DHEA as a precursor is easily available. A full replacement dose is around 15 milligrams, which an 80 or 90-year-old man might need.

## Natural Antibiotics

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you recommend effective natural antibiotics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The two I think are safest are flowers of sulfur and aspirin. Flowers of sulfur can be used on the skin or intestine. 200 milligrams orally in two or three days can kill off the most toxic intestinal bacteria and fungus. Candida, for example, converts the sulfur to sulfuric acid and poisons itself. It is very harmless to the intestine in small amounts.

Aspirin, when used with standard antibiotics, increases their effectiveness. But all by itself, it has antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal effects.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is taking aspirin preventatively okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, anywhere from 100 to 300 milligrams. You can buy pure USP grade aspirin powder cheaply.

## Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) vs. Niacinamide

**Patrick Timpone:** Is Dr. Peat familiar with NR (Nicotinamide Riboside) for improving lifespan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm skeptical that those reduced substances make it into the cells without being oxidized en route. Just taking niacinamide will increase your intracellular NAD. That's very simple, economical, and harmless.

## Progesterone Supplementation

**Patrick Timpone:** How does one know when progesterone supplementation is required?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pregnancy has an anti-aging effect. Studies in rabbits and humans show that lifespan increases in proportion to the number of babies, likely due to the residual high progesterone level reversing the pro-aging effects of estrogen.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener who is post-menopausal shows no estrogen or progesterone on tests. Her doctor wants to put her on hormone replacement. Would just progesterone help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Typically it does. With aging, serum estrogen goes down, but that doesn't reflect the biological situation. Estrogen is formed in cells under stress and bound there. It can't get into the bloodstream without progesterone. Progesterone knocks out the estrogen receptor and releases the estrogen from the cells so the liver can detoxify it. So, a woman who is most under the influence of estrogen will often show almost zero estrogen in the serum because it's all trapped inside the cells.

## Gluten Sensitivity

**Patrick Timpone:** What is your take on the gluten sensitivity explosion in the last 15 years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gluten interacts with stress and estrogen. The gluten molecule has a stretch of amino acids that resembles proteins involved with stress and inflammation. If you are stressed and have high estrogen, you create a condition that responds to gluten. If you are in good condition, gluten is digested properly.

Also, it relates to bad diet and improperly leavened bread. The old-fashioned 12-hour sourdough leavening process destroys almost all the gluten and converts it to nutritious protein. Modern bread is made quickly, leaving the gluten intact. That gluten is allergenic. When I baked my own sourdough bread, I could eat a whole loaf and sleep perfectly, whereas a slice of store bread would disturb my sleep.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks for being with us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
