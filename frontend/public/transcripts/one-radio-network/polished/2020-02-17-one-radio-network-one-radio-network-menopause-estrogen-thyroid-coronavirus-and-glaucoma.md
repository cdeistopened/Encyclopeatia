## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** We are back with our second show this morning. It is the third Monday of the month, so Dr. Ray Peat is here. He is a PhD from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He started working with hormones back in 1968, wrote his dissertation in 1972, and talks a lot about progesterone and hormones. His main thesis is that energy and structure are independent at every level. Dr. Peat, good morning to you, sir.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is going on in your life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm working on two or three new articles right now. I learned that Gilbert Ling died last summer. He's been such a big influence on my work for 50 years that I decided to write an article introducing his ideas to people who don't get them in the usual public media.

## Gilbert Ling and Cell Physiology

**Patrick Timpone:** What was Gilbert Ling's specialty?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cell physiology. He came over from China on a scholarship in the 1940s and very quickly developed a new kind of cell electrode, a microscopically fine tip that goes into an individual cell to measure the voltage. It's named the Ling-Gerard Microelectrode, named after him and his thesis professor. Despite being the first person to have the technology for measuring the electronic condition of a single cell, his observations were contradictory to the dogma that had been established in the 1930s. So for 70 years, his work was simply not recognized, even though he answered all objections and showed that the picture of the cell in textbooks is a big fantasy.

**Patrick Timpone:** How did his work affect what you did or what we know about health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was taking courses to work in nerve biology or brain physiology. Within the first weeks of reading the history of cell physiology, I realized my professor was talking about fantasies. So I dropped out of the brain end of biology research and looked for people closer to the actual facts. I found the reproductive system, where you can look at one cell at a time—the fertilized ovum. It was easier to talk objectively about the physiology of a single cell rather than the complexities of the mature brain.

If I had chosen to work with the first professor, he would have said, "First we threw away the bad data." What he meant was observations that didn't fit the dogma had to be discarded. When I was working in his lab, I had a microelectrode inside a cell and showed him there were different electrical potentials within a single cell. As soon as he saw it, he jerked away like he had been electrocuted. I never talked to him again. I came to see the biological world from Ling's perspective: it's a giant business structure that doesn't care about the details of reality as long as it can be turned into profit.

## Pharmaceutical Influence on Research

**Patrick Timpone:** Do they do that on a very deep level at the medical schools?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. Medical schools are hugely directed by the pharmaceutical industry. About 50 years ago, I saw biased research coming out of Yale Medical School. I wrote to the Dean asking how much funding they were getting from the estrogen industry. He wrote back saying he was insulted I would imply money influenced their research, but he wouldn't tell me the amount. At USC, I found their funding was about 99% for estrogen and almost none for progesterone. Everyone said favorable things about estrogen and unfavorable things about progesterone because that's where the money was.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you often see people do well when they take a little extra progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Both men and women equally depend on progesterone. It's a massively important brain hormone—10 times as much in the brain as in the blood. It is basically a pharmaceutical industry fraud to call it the "pregnancy hormone."

**Patrick Timpone:** And we get too much estrogen just from modern lifestyle?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you gain too much weight, eat foods that suppress metabolism, or are stressed, any tissue can make estrogen. Even if ovaries are removed, the body makes more estrogen under stress. The dogma about menopause is really a failure of the ovaries to produce enough progesterone to support the brain. In that situation, you are deficient in progesterone, leaving the body in stress. Hans Selye was one of the first people to define this in the 1940s; he said a big dose of estrogen imitates the shock phase of the stress reaction.

## Endometriosis and Thyroid

**Patrick Timpone:** Ania wants to know about endometriosis. Can that be helped with thyroid medication?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid and good nutrition will activate your liver to excrete every bit of estrogen arriving in the bloodstream. Being malnourished or low in thyroid means estrogen accumulates in the body, specifically in the uterus, breast, and pituitary gland. If you can establish a proper monthly cycle, the cyst along with the rest of the endometrium should be sloughed off.

## Food Combinations: Milk, Juice, and Starch

**Patrick Timpone:** Jeff asks: You recommend drinking orange juice and milk. Edgar Cayce said not to combine citrus with other foods. Is he suggesting having orange juice and milk together?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You shouldn't combine orange juice with meat or an iron-rich food because it will make you absorb too much iron, and it can react to produce free radicals. But I don't know of any harm it does with milk.

**Patrick Timpone:** Mr. Kahn asks about boiling greens and drinking the water for calcium and magnesium. How much should he have?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk normally provides enough magnesium in balance with calcium. But if you are getting cramps, an ounce or so of that concentrated water from boiling greens is enough to relax them. If you need that magnesium supplement, it probably means your thyroid function is low, because thyroid helps your cells retain magnesium.

**Patrick Timpone:** Lynn asks if protein and sugar are best not eaten with starch? Does this mean marmalade with tortillas or eggs with rice is best avoided?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Marmalade is good with anything. The starches that cause problems are combined starches like beans, overripe peas, and grains that haven't been sprouted or turned into sourdough. Those complex starches feed bacteria and cause gas and bowel inflammation. Pure starch, like corn starch, is less likely to cause inflammation, but it has a high glycemic index and is fattening. That's why I emphasize fruit sugar over starch.

**Patrick Timpone:** She heard you say you like cheese with tortillas. What makes cheese okay with starch?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the tortilla, which is a modified starch. The Chinese and Central Americans discovered that cooking grain in lye or lime digests the grain and destroys the things that make it indigestible. Nixtamalized corn—used in hominy, tamales, and tortillas—is very rich in calcium and niacin and is easy to digest. It is not like other grain starches.

## Coronavirus (Recorded Feb 2020)

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you think this coronavirus thing is going to get bigger, or will it fade out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the CDC, the pharmaceutical industry, and the WHO have their way, it'll be big business. So far, it looks similar to old coronaviruses, possibly twice as virulent as the average flu. The average flu kills about 1% of infected people who are already sick; this one is killing 1.5% or 2%. It is a little worse than average, but the WHO and CDC blow these up as gigantic world-ending dangers to sell more vaccines. The trouble is those vaccines won't have been tested for safety. Going back to the 1970s swine flu, the vaccines caused vastly more deaths and paralysis than the flu itself.

## Glaucoma and Eye Health

**Patrick Timpone:** Does Dr. Peat have ideas for narrow closed-angle glaucoma? Is making a hole in the iris safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Your physiology is a stress physiology. Increases in eye pressure are somewhat like blood pressure. Improving the balance of thyroid and progesterone against stress hormones (estrogen, cortisol, serotonin) will improve the pressure. The surgery to punch a hole in the iris has the risk of increasing pressure with potential harm.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you think it's possible that we have infections going on with glaucoma and cataracts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there is always a change in bacterial load. Simple things like avoiding indigestible foods that cause inflammation can help. Bacteria in the intestine send signals to other areas. The lens depends on a constant flow of liquid for nutrition. The same factors that raise pressure can decrease the flow of nutrition into the lens, leading to swelling and opacity.

## Hormone Testing

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a simple test to get a good overview of hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Life Extension Foundation has hormone panels for a good price. A blood test is the most reliable. Saliva tests for steroid hormones like progesterone aren't reliable because saliva composition changes with emotion or appetite.

## Depression and Serotonin

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener in his mid-40s has struggled with depression for 15 years. SSRIs don't help much anymore. He understands you are no fan of serotonin. What is your view on the cause of depression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing to check is temperature and heart rate. Average body temperature is now well below 98.6°F. If your adrenal and thyroid hormones are low, your energy is low, making everything stressful. Serotonin is a universal indicator of stress. It, along with estrogen, acts like beating a tired horse—they increase functions temporarily but risk harming vital functions. As energy production decreases, the brain shifts to emergency drivers like adrenaline, serotonin, and estrogen. These can create mania or depression. Keeping your thyroid up is essential. Methylene blue can repair the energy system and help depression, but it is a chemical substitute for the active thyroid hormone supported by DHEA, progesterone, and pregnenolone.

## Memory and Consciousness

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you know how to tell if a memory is a false memory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. We put things together every time we remember. The past is always with us as a potential, and we create a picture that represents what we have experienced. If you learn a new situation you weren't aware of before, you can create memories that explain what you now know to be true.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: If mitochondria have a will of their own, does being a creator mean imposing personal will upon the mitochondria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think of mitochondria as separate at all. They reflect the happy, active, energized state of the cell. Nerves are in close communication with mitochondria electronically and oxidatively. We are an energetic, oxidizing whole with purpose and perspective. The medical-pharmaceutical myth created a machine-like picture of the body with little compartments, but really it is a continuous functioning unit.

## Healing and Rest

**Patrick Timpone:** If someone just rested for a long time believing the body can heal, is there a good chance it would?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Things happening around us can help us heal or make us sick. I once watched Supreme Court judges talk on TV, and my blood pressure went up to 168 over 110. Seeing possibilities open up can help everything heal. Historically, laying down and stopping the consumption of things making you sick was the basic cure. Sophia Loren was said to have spent six months in bed to ensure she had her baby.

**Patrick Timpone:** Years ago, with natural food and no pollution, literature suggests people didn't live that long. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The Roman Empire kept good vital statistics. Men aged 20 to 30 had a short lifespan because of war, but women and those who survived their 20s had a life expectancy almost identical to 20th-century Europe and America—into their 70s.

## Detoxification and Liver Health

**Patrick Timpone:** What do you recommend to detoxify the body of a chronic infection and hormone imbalance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For an internal fungus infection, a pinch of flowers of sulfur (200 or 300 milligrams) taken orally for two or three days will suppress candida and some bacteria. The fungus secretes enzymes that convert the sulfur to hydrogen sulfide locally, which poisons the yeast. In the concentration that diffuses into the intestine, it acts as an antioxidant.

**Patrick Timpone:** Amy asks if it is important to eat only organic grass-fed beef liver, or is regular beef liver okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't worry about organic liver. Experiments analyzed commercial animals and found agricultural chemicals in the urine, blood, and muscles. But if the animal had 24 hours of isolation from those chemicals, the liver was able to capture and destroy them. The liver was the cleanest organ in the animal.

## Urinary Frequency and Dry Skin

**Patrick Timpone:** Amy also says she urinates every couple of hours. Can this be a thyroid issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If your thyroid is active, you burn calories and breathe out or evaporate about three quarts of water a day. If your thyroid is low and you're burning only 1,000 calories, you aren't vaporizing the water, so it has to be eliminated as urine.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you keep skin moisturized in the dry winter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Don't bathe excessively. Soap dries your skin. You want to preserve the protective oils formed in the skin.

## Allergies and Fibrosis

**Patrick Timpone:** What are the safest antihistamines for someone with arrhythmia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Benadryl is safe if not taken in excess. Ma Huang (Ephedra) doesn't have the risk of stopping the heart. I think Cyproheptadine, which reduces both histamine and serotonin effects, is safe for the heart.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you suggest ways to help pulmonary fibrosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fibrosis anywhere (heart, liver, kidneys, lungs) has a common hormonal cause. Estrogen creates a condition of effective oxygen deficiency (hypoxia), which leads to collagen formation and fibrosis. Hypoxia also leads to angiotensin, which tightens blood vessels. Drugs that interfere with angiotensin are approved for high blood pressure, but they also protect against fibrosis.

## Circulation and Veins

**Patrick Timpone:** Amanda has poor circulation, cold hands and feet, and veiny hands.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid and progesterone can have a big effect. Estrogen activates angiotensin and creates a shock syndrome. Bulging veins often mean they aren't getting enough energy; they are in a shock-like state. I've seen progesterone make those veins disappear in less than an hour.

## Fats and Lipofuscin

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it possible for stress to transform saturated fat into polyunsaturated fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To a slight degree, but the unsaturated fats we make with our own enzymes aren't as toxic as the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) we get from the environment.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can we get rid of lipofuscin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, progesterone is a big help. By blocking the estrogen that interacts with PUFA to make that pigment, progesterone can eliminate those senile brown spots.

## Potatoes and Allergies

**Patrick Timpone:** You've recommended eating potatoes with plenty of butter or cream. How much butter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't eaten potatoes for a long time, but if they are very well cooked, they are less allergenic. A pat of butter will protect against persorption.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are allergies a lifelong thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Robert Kennedy Jr. mentioned that childhood allergies were less than 3% before the 1970s, and after 1989, about half of all kids have allergies. He was saying vaccines are a major known cause.

## Supplements: Pregnenolone and Thyroid

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a good source of pregnenolone? Many sources seem to cause side effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think some of it has been bad manufacturing leaving impurities, specifically estrogenic materials. Women have reported swollen breasts and cramps from bad brands. Good pregnenolone shouldn't have any symptoms at all.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener has venous insufficiency. Is this related to hormone imbalance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The wall of the vein consists partly of smooth muscle. When energy is low (hypothyroid, low progesterone), the muscle is too weak to keep its normal diameter. The vein swells, and the valves don't meet, allowing blood to flow back. Getting energy up with thyroid and progesterone allows the veins to close up enough for the valves to function.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it true that some people shed more hair while taking thyroid supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1970s, a study analyzed 10 brands of thyroid glandular supplements. Only two contained actual thyroid substance. The others contained only casein and iodine to fool the USP test. I found that cats could tell the difference. My cat loved real thyroid but tried to bury the fake brands.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can a 66-year-old woman take progesterone every day without a break?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver adapts to a constant supply, so the effect gets weaker. It is good to stop for a week every month to maintain potency.

**Patrick Timpone:** How can we help our thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keep meat intake lower and use milk, eggs, and cheese for a higher proportion of protein. Before 1940, people got thyroid in their diet because fish heads were used for soup, and thyroid glands were put into sausages. Then the USDA said it had to be sold to drug companies.

**Patrick Timpone:** What do you think about drinking food-grade hydrogen peroxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can cause serious burns. Even enzymes like catalase that normally dispose of peroxide are destroyed by it if there is too much, and then it starts destroying tissue.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thank you so much for being here today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye.
