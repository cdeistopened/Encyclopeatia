## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** It is the third Tuesday on One Radio Network, and Dr. Raymond Peat has graciously agreed to come visit, take your questions, and kick around his research. He started long ago with a PhD from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He started working on hormones in 1968 and wrote his dissertation in 1972, in which he outlined his ideas on progesterone and hormones closely related to it. The main thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level. Dr. Peat, good morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you do ongoing research all the time? Are you always looking around?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep. Always reading and trying to figure things out.

## Serotonin, Oxygen, and CO2

**Patrick Timpone:** Have you figured anything out recently where you had an "aha" moment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, a couple of things about how serotonin works. For example, people have known for several decades—starting in the 1930s, actually—that hospital oxygen isn't good for people. A physiologist, based on how people react to altitude, tried adding 5% to 7% carbon dioxide to the oxygen. They started using it in fire departments for resuscitating people, and it worked very well. They tried it on newborn babies and found that it was good for stimulating breathing. It was used all around the country in fire departments for maybe five or ten years, then gradually went out of use.

Hospitals almost always keep plain 100% oxygen on hand for patients. But several people in the last 20 or 30 years have started looking at the outcome when they oxygenate a person. When the blood saturation approaches 100%—when it's above 90%, actually—the mortality starts increasing rather than decreasing. About twice as many of the hyper-oxygenated patients don't come out of the hospital.

I realized that this has been known as an effect of strenuous exercising. When you breathe very intensely, your blood can become very over-oxygenated. They know that increases prolactin as a stress reaction hormone. They tried having a person breathe 60% to 100% oxygen and found that drives their prolactin very high.

I realized that what is happening is the lack of carbon dioxide in the blood when you are being treated with oxygen, or just hyperventilating, raises the pH of your blood. This causes the platelets to release their serotonin, and serotonin drives up prolactin. People have rejected that idea because they believed there was a blood-brain barrier that would keep the platelet serotonin out of the brain. But in fact, I've been going over the evidence that there is no blood-brain barrier. When you have too much estrogen, for example, the enzymes in the capillaries of the brain lose their ability to detoxify serotonin, and so it goes right from your blood into your brain.

**Patrick Timpone:** So let's unpack this. If folks over-exercise, we get too oxygenated and we lose too much carbon dioxide by breathing fast? And that could be a problem for people running 25 or 50 miles who fall over with heart attacks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. There are more than 300,000 people every year just in the United States who die with cardiac arrest. It is known that serotonin increases the delay between contraction and readiness for a new contraction. The SSRIs—serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants—increase that delay by raising your serotonin. They are actually known to be able to increase cardiac arrest frequency.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the SSRIs are falsely helping people to "feel better" by juicing up their serotonin levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the theory.

**Patrick Timpone:** Let's go back to prolactin. You said it increases when we over-oxygenate or over-exercise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Starting in about 1965, when the birth control pills came on the market, there was suddenly about a hundredfold increase in the incidence of pituitary tumors that secrete prolactin. That was an effect of the birth control pill creating prolactinoma tumors. That is because estrogen causes you to hyperventilate and interferes with your thyroid gland. The thyroid makes you produce carbon dioxide, which is an anti-serotonin agent. So if you are high in estrogen or low in thyroid function, you're going to have effectively a shortage of carbon dioxide and an excess of prolactin and serotonin.

**Patrick Timpone:** So when we exercise, we want to work towards not breathing so much and retaining the carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. That can make the exercise much more effective.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why? What is the carbon dioxide doing in the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For one thing, it delivers the right amount of oxygen to the tissue. The tissue, like your muscle, produces carbon dioxide, and the blood arriving in the capillaries releases oxygen in proportion to how much carbon dioxide you are producing. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide is keeping the pH of the blood in the proper range where the serotonin can be stuck into the platelets. The platelets lose their affinity for serotonin if you don't have enough carbon dioxide.

## Thyroid Function and Temperature

**Patrick Timpone:** So the fewer breaths we take, the more carbon dioxide we're retaining?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not really, only metaphorically. If your thyroid function is low, you just don't need much oxygen in your tissues. You can be hyperventilating even when you're only taking 10 or 15 breaths per minute because your tissue needs so little oxygen. If you breathe at a normal rate, you're hyperventilating relative to your needs. The typical diabetic or hypothyroid person is going around at rest with an excess of lactic acid in the blood because they are losing carbon dioxide and producing lactic acid, as they can't use the oxygen that is in the blood.

**Patrick Timpone:** We had a fellow on the show suggest using a laser temperature gun on the bottom of your big toe. He said it should be around 90 degrees for proper thyroid function. Is that valid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've used the little infrared things that measure oxygenation of the tissues [pulse oximeters]. Hospitals say you shouldn't get below 90% saturation. I saw that in cold weather, my fingers always showed 98% or 99% saturation. But when I was warm and my fingers were actually using oxygen, I could get my fingers down to 90% saturation. So if your tissue isn't using oxygen, you can be dead and still have saturated hemoglobin. If you quick-froze a person's hand, it would stay saturated with oxygen. So those little gadgets used in hospitals just don't say very much about your physiology.

**Patrick Timpone:** But what about the temperature of the toe being 90 degrees?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure, if it's temperature. If your feet are below roughly 80 degrees, they start producing inflammatory signals, and it can cause your whole system to become stressed. Warm feet will make you sleep better by reducing inflammation.

**Patrick Timpone:** So that's the classic "cold hands, cold feet" with low thyroid people. Can you walk us through what's happening there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oxygen makes you burn fat and sugar, turning it into energy. In the process of producing ATP and using the ATP, you are producing heat in proportion to the amount of oxygen you are using. The thyroid is what makes you use oxygen to burn preferably sugar, but also fat or protein. So in proportion to the health of your thyroid, you'll be consuming oxygen and producing heat.

However, heat production can also increase under the influence of stress and cortisol, which could be breaking down your tissue rather than using oxygen properly. So with temperature alone, you have to know the actual amount of oxygen being consumed. That's almost all under the influence of thyroid function.

In the 1930s and 40s, doctors used an apparatus where you would breathe for two minutes to measure oxygen consumption. Using that test, 30% of Americans were hypothyroid. But when the drug companies came on the market with a supposed way to measure thyroid in your blood, they convinced the whole world that only 5% of the population is hypothyroid. It was a great medical disaster.

## Milk: Raw vs. Boiled

**Patrick Timpone:** I have a tale about milk. In Ayurvedic medicine, they suggest boiling raw milk to help absorb the fat and kill bacteria. I boiled some raw milk recently, added cardamom and cinnamon, and had one of the worst cases of food poisoning I've ever had. A friend told me boiling raw milk might make it more toxic if there is bacteria.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wonder about the cardamom. Are you used to using that?

**Patrick Timpone:** No, but I've been using it for a couple of months.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think boiling would make it worse. For years in Mexico, we often used boiled milk because we didn't know the cows. But when you have your own cow or know the cow, then raw milk is fine. If you don't know the source, heating it is a reasonable practice. You can inactivate the germs satisfactorily just by holding it at 160 degrees.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a difference between 160 degrees and boiling at 212?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It inactivates more proteins when you boil it. There are theories that it improves or damages digestibility, but it probably hasn't been researched enough. I have a couple of times gotten fairly sick from using an organic raw milk, and I think it was because the cows were eating weeds that I was allergic to.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: Do you drink milk with added vitamins, and are you concerned about the emulsifiers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't really trust them, but I drink it because it's available. I am concerned about the possible emulsifiers used to get the vitamins in solution, but I have been using commercial vitamin-added milk for many years and apparently haven't had serious problems with it.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you drink homogenized or non-homogenized?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I like the low-temperature pasteurized, but usually I drink the homogenized just because it's convenient not to have to shake it up. I don't think homogenization makes it more difficult for humans. Our digestion effectively homogenizes it; the bile acids are an emulsifier that break up the particles very thoroughly.

## Sugar and Diabetes

**Patrick Timpone:** We were taught that white sugar and white flour are terrible. But you don't seem to be against white sugar per se?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not at all. The evidence against white flour was that they were using a bleach to make it white, and the bleach was nerve-toxic. They demonstrated dogs would have convulsions. They changed to a less toxic way of bleaching flour, so it isn't a problem now.

White sugar is very highly purified—more pure than many reagent chemicals in research labs. It is washed to a crystalline purity, so it is almost perfectly free of allergenic material. Brown sugar can cause intense inflammatory reactions for sensitive people, and molasses is even worse. White sugar is very safe. Since it has none of the problems of fats, it doesn't break down into inflammation-promoting material like all fats do under stress.

It is safe for diabetics. 150 years ago in France and England, doctors cured terminal diabetic patients—people wasting away—by giving them as much sugar as they wanted. That was about 11 or 12 ounces of white sugar added to their regular meals.

**Patrick Timpone:** They were curing diabetes like that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It works because it suppresses the breakdown of fat in your body. The free fatty acids are constantly killing the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin when you are under stress. You have a stressful event, produce free fatty acids, they kill off your insulin-producing cells, and so you're unable to oxidize the fat, which keeps you under stress.

You can break the cycle, as those doctors showed, by letting them have as much sugar as they crave. That provides energy. Their blood sugar might go up to 400mg percent, but in doing that, it provides the cells the energy they need to stop the stress reaction. That stops the breakdown of fat. Glucose happens to stimulate the creation of stem cells and beta cells in the pancreas. So sugar causes the cells to be renewed; free fatty acids kill them.

**Patrick Timpone:** That is so contrary to what is going on in the world of diabetes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40 or 50 years ago in Israel, physiologists realized that it is free fatty acids that cause diabetes. Diabetics can't get glucose into their cells, so they are having the equivalent of hypoglycemia—specifically neuroglucopenia. Their brain can't get glucose, so it sends out signals to increase the food supply, leading to the breakdown of fat and production of toxins.

## Deuterium in Water and Sugar

**Patrick Timpone:** You mentioned organic beet sugar might be a good choice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Beet sugars are often grown in Idaho, the Dakotas, and inland mountain areas. The rainfall there is depleted in deuterium. Research in the last five years has shown that heavy water—deuterium—is age-promoting. When rain falls, the heavy water rains out first. The last rain to fall inland is lighter water. So beet sugar has less deuterium than tropical cane sugar.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do we know how to get deuterium out of the water we drink?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's been done for the nuclear industry, but it's hard to do on a practical scale. For many years, I've figured that taking as much water as possible in the form of milk and orange juice is best. The cow and the orange tree act as filters. As they age, they accumulate deuterium, and the water that passes through them is somewhat deuterium-depleted.

## Supplements and Exercise

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about desiccated liver tablets for bodybuilders. Is the heme iron a problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The heme group is how we use iron in the blood. The iron atom is isolated by the carbon framework. When you eat meat or liver, the iron is isolated until it gets into your bloodstream. But if you take an iron supplement, the free iron ions react in your stomach and can destroy nutrients like Vitamin A and B12 before they are even digested.

**Patrick Timpone:** Have you seen anything bodybuilders can take to build muscle without harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doing the exercise in the proper way so you don't lower your androgens. The anti-stress program—everything that keeps your cortisol low—leaves the androgens, such as testosterone and DHEA, active. Keeping cortisol low is something the Germans discovered in the 1960s. They were accused of doping because their androgen levels seemed impossibly high, but it turns out if you just don't exercise so hard, your androgens are much higher.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do we do muscle work the right way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Concentric contraction protects the muscle. If you lift a weight and then drop it without letting it down gradually, it's the lengthening of the muscle under stress [eccentric contraction] that damages the muscle. If you walk or run uphill, the dominant action is concentric. Walking downhill injures the muscle because you're stretching the muscle under pressure.

**Patrick Timpone:** So concentric is pulling the weight up. Dropping it slowly is bad?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Letting it down slowly while resisting gravity is stretching the muscle, doing microscopic damage. That produces cortisol, which damages the mitochondria. They've shown that old people doing concentric contractions *only* can create new mitochondria and restore the energy system.

## Sleep and Serotonin

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about restoring dopamine and reducing serotonin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The important thing is to limit your tryptophan intake as far as you can without becoming protein deficient. That's why I advocate gelatin, because gelatin contains no tryptophan, which is the source for serotonin. It also has the precursor for dopamine.

**Patrick Timpone:** I thought we needed tryptophan to go to sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not really. Like histamine, too much serotonin keeps you awake.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is missing in people with insomnia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is the main thing. Sleep researchers found that thyroid-deficient people went through the night without ever reaching the deep sleep stages. I found that if I took 5 or 10 micrograms of T3 thyroid, I would go to sleep perfectly in about five minutes.

## Thyroid, Testosterone, and Estrogen

**Patrick Timpone:** What effect does increasing thyroid have on testosterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Too much thyroid can create stress and waste testosterone. Not enough thyroid will cause testosterone to be converted into estrogen. Estrogen blocks the secretion of thyroid from the gland. Progesterone has a powerful releasing function on the thyroid gland, so when it has been blocked by estrogen, a dose of progesterone can reactivate the gland.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about corns and calluses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bad shoes cause the callus to form. Put something on to soften the material, like salicylic acid and urea.

## Learned Helplessness

**Patrick Timpone:** How do we take the edge off learned helplessness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid hormone is one thing; progesterone is another. An improved diet that shifts you away from the serotonin side of things helps, because serotonin is at the heart of learned helplessness.

With animals, researchers would put them in a hopeless situation, such as a tank of water where they were forced to swim. If they had never had the experience of escaping, animals would sometimes let themselves drown in just a few minutes. But if they had ever been in a situation where they managed to escape, that one experience would change their perspective and physiology. They would then be able to swim for many hours. It makes a total difference in the ability to survive just by changing your mental picture of how things work.

## Hydrogen and CO2 Therapy

**Patrick Timpone:** Can Dr. Peat comment on how hydrogen might work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has dehydrogenase enzymes that usually receive electrons from fat or sugar metabolism. Some believe they can receive electrons directly from molecular hydrogen. It seems to reduce inflammation and stress, similar to how sugar provides a generous amount of electron energy.

**Patrick Timpone:** Regarding CO2 therapy, does anyone do that anymore?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have heard of a few hospitals in the US and several in Europe, particularly Germany and Eastern Europe, still using it.

## Aging and Heat Loss

**Patrick Timpone:** Does wearing a hat to keep the head warm slow the aging process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Also putting on a soft wool cap for sleeping. The head, kidneys, and heart have a very high metabolic rate. Your head loses a lot of energy. Big animals live longer partly because their geometry has less surface area for losing heat. A mouse loses a tremendous fraction of its biological energy through radiation. Putting a woolly hat on reduces the stress. At an average temperature of 70 degrees, a person is losing more than half of their body energy by radiation.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why is wool good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The wool fiber has a catalytic function. I think the microscopic structure has a bacteria-suppressing effect, similar to how a natural wood butcher block is self-sanitizing.

## Libido and Supplements

**Patrick Timpone:** What is a good way to improve libido after age 40? DHEA, progesterone, pregnenolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they are in the right quantity. I've known aging men who took 25mg tablets of DHEA, and their estrogen became as high as a young cycling woman. You don't want to take more androgen than is optimal. A young man produces about 12mg of DHEA per day. Pregnenolone is the safest. I experimented for a year taking an average of 3,000 to 4,000 milligrams of pregnenolone per day just for fun. I had no side effects, and my skin was sort of rejuvenated.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about Centrophenoxine to remove lipofuscin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One group found that Vitamin E was removing lipofuscin from nerve cells. But they did a control test with the ethanol (alcohol) used to dissolve the Vitamin E, and the ethanol control removed the lipofuscin almost as well. A very tiny amount of alcohol seems to do the job very safely, like Vitamin E.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about black cumin seed oil for Candida?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have no experience with that. But I've had a lot of experience with flowers of sulfur [precipitated sulfur] for Candida. The fungus has exoenzymes that convert the sulfur into hydrogen sulfide, which poisons the fungus locally.

## Milk Mucus and Sugar Myths

**Patrick Timpone:** Does drinking milk cause mucus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mucus is our first defense barrier against alien substances. If you get bad milk or are allergic to something in it, you will produce a copious amount. But I think a lot of people just don't like the concept of consuming an animal secretion.

**Patrick Timpone:** Doesn't sugar rip arterial walls, which cholesterol then patches up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The "sugar disease" (diabetes) was originally defined as a wasting disease where you couldn't build tissue. The glycation of proteins is not really glycation in most cases; it is a chemical reaction produced by the small fragments of polyunsaturated fats breaking down—producing things like acrolein—which is interpreted as glycation.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about honey and maple syrup?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They contain nutrients, but they are produced by high-temperature dehydration. Heating sugar in the presence of amino acids creates brown toxic material which is allergenic. Honey is fine if it hasn't been heated above pasteurization temperature.

## Migraines, Ketosis, and Antioxidants

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener gets optic migraines (wavy vision).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens when you aren't getting circulation to the optic part of your brain. Blood vessel spasms and serotonin are involved. Aspirin and sugar are first aid for that. Thyroid is long-range preventive.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about Aubrey de Grey's claim that ketosis is chemically reactive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ketones found in fruits and vegetables are very good. But if you produce "ketosis" yourself [through starvation or diet], you produce ketone bodies, one of which is a reactive alcohol. The ketones you produce yourself have side effects.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about Carbon 60 (Buckyballs)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think those are risky because tiny nanoparticles can activate the inflammatory process.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are antioxidants overhyped?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the worst damage to the body is an absence of oxidative processes—reductive stress. We have to avoid an excess of electrons and keep our oxidative system working to consume them, not try to block them with antioxidants. Cancer cells are extremely well provided with antioxidant systems.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is that why you aren't a proponent of Vitamin C?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Partly. But also because a diet of vegetables, meat, milk, and eggs provides thousands of milligrams of Vitamin C daily in the form of dehydroascorbate, which isn't usually measured in reference books. Grains are the only major food that don't contain Vitamin C.

## Miscellaneous Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** What form of aspirin do you prefer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I use crystalline USP aspirin. I try to average about 300 milligrams a day because it protects against anything inflammatory.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why are veins in the back of the hands an indication of estrogen status?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen weakens smooth muscle contraction. Varicose veins are an extreme example. Sometimes just a glass of milk or orange juice to get your salt and sugar up is enough to fix it.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about lipomas (fatty tumors)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there is any harm in removing them.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener had a hysterectomy and takes estradiol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the women I've known who had endometriosis stopped having symptoms when they corrected their thyroid problem. The thyroid should bring the estrogen down under control.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you detox DDT?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping your liver function good is the basic detox method. Eating a balanced diet and keeping your thyroid function up will make your liver handle things optimally.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks for being here.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thanks.
