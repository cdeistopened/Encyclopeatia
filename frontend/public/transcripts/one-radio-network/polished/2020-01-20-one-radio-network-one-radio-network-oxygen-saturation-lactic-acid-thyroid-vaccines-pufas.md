# One Radio Network: Dr. Raymond Peat on Energy, Metabolism, and Thyroid Health
**Date:** January 20, 2020
**Host:** Patrick Timpone
**Guest:** Dr. Raymond Peat

## Introduction: Energy and Structure

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat is with us now. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He started his work on hormones in 1968 and wrote his dissertation outlining his ideas on progesterone and related hormones. His main thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level. Dr. Peat, good morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** How is your life, sir?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very interesting. I had an interview yesterday about philosophy. It was an interesting change of subject, but basically, everything interrelates, so it keeps things interesting.

**Patrick Timpone:** Maybe we can talk about that a little bit. Your thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent. Is that almost a spiritual idea, that spirit or chi creates all this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is going on all through the universe. The same things that generate energy and order in planets and galaxies are exactly the same things happening in our bodies. Energy flows and creates order.

**Patrick Timpone:** So as we allow the energy to flow more, we have more order in our life, body, and health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep. Oxygen is receiving electrons. Sunlight puts electrons into the form of sugar. That is the source of all our energy: energized electrons from the sun in sugar. When we consume it, if we are really healthy, it goes all the way down to oxygen, forming water. So the cycle is complete.

But if we aren't healthy, then the sugar electron energy stops very near where it started and comes out as lactic acid. It is only half broken down, and it becomes toxic rather than constructive. When we burn the electrons all the way down to oxygen, a byproduct of the sugar is carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is what keeps our structure finely tuned and adjusted, favoring that complete use of energy.

## Lactic Acid, Cancer, and Carbon Dioxide

**Patrick Timpone:** So the lactic acid and the incomplete use of sugar could be one of the reasons why sugar is blamed for cancer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. When Warburg discovered that cancer produces a huge amount of lactic acid—even when it has oxygen and should be able to oxidize it all the way to carbon dioxide—people for 100 years have been inattentive to what that means. There are still exercise physiologists claiming that lactic acid is a wonderful source of energy.

What Warburg started discovering was that it isn't just cancer producing lactic acid, but lactic acid itself produces cancer and keeps it going. It creates the energy block in other cells. When the cancer cells turn glucose into lactic acid, the lactic acid circulating in the neighboring cells disturbs their energy, interferes, and displaces the carbon dioxide and its metabolism. So the cancer spreads just by lactic acid to a great extent. It becomes systemic. Circulating lactic acid can be a test for cancer and general health. When it is circulating, it puts all of your body under stress, shifting the electronic balance away from full oxidation and displacing carbon dioxide.

**Patrick Timpone:** In the perfect model, we turn sugar into carbon dioxide. What prohibits it from doing that and turns it into lactic acid? Is that how we create disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. Just about anything that interferes. The idea of stress is extremely general. It can be too much activity or too little activity. If you are put in a cage so you can't move, the same physiology happens as if you were forced to run on a treadmill. When you are strapped down, your serotonin increases, and the serotonin turns on that cancer or stress metabolism. If you are forced to run constantly, the circulating lactic acid suppresses the active thyroid hormone and interferes with your ability to finish the oxidation to carbon dioxide. It leaves you in a stress condition.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why does the body like to have this carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have looked at all kinds of organisms, including single-cell organisms. There are simple organisms that don't need oxygen—they just need some form of energy—but it turns out that all of the simple organisms tested still need carbon dioxide. It is really in the whole picture of life; it is even more essential than oxygen. But most organisms have the oxygen and produce their own carbon dioxide.

## Exercise and CO2 Retention

**Patrick Timpone:** When we exercise, is there a way to retain more carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just the right amount of exercise. You don't want to overtrain; that is where the lactic acid starts melting you down, increasing cortisol, and lowering the constructive progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone. The right amount of exercise increases those constructive steroid hormones and produces more carbon dioxide than at rest. You are raising your body temperature by the right amount of exercise, and that increases the carbon dioxide.

The carbon dioxide binds to all of the cellular proteins and changes the way the hormones interact on the cell proteins. Many years ago, in explaining respiratory physiology, they always mentioned that a major way to transport carbon dioxide on the red blood cells is in the form of carbamino compounds. The carbon dioxide sticks to an amino group on the hemoglobin molecule. The acid and the base stick together instantly. Upon reaching the lungs, where there is more oxygen, that compound decomposes.

Strangely, only two or three people I found over the last 50 or 60 years have been interested in that carbamino reaction. It happens not only in the red blood cells but everywhere there is a protein with an exposed amino group. That means the so-called hormone receptors are influenced and modified by the presence of carbon dioxide.

These groups happen to be where oxidative damage happens. You've seen the diabetic way of diagnosing red blood cells when they are getting glycated. Glycation happens in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, in the blood vessels, and in aging in general. These so-called glycation compounds are sticking to the same place the carbon dioxide should be. If you have high carbon dioxide, any glycating compounds—like breaking down sugar or unsaturated fats—just don't stick because the site is protected by carbon dioxide binding.

## Oxygen Saturation and Breathing

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you utilize this information to help you stay healthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I make sure that I take some thyroid to keep my body temperature and heart rate up. Every couple of years, I check my oxygen saturation. If I'm at a high altitude, it's easier to get my oxygen saturation down to the level that is safest. Just waking up in the morning when I'm feeling best, my oxygen saturation will go down to 90% or 89%. If I'm under stress, my finger gadget that measures the oxygen-hemoglobin saturation might go up to 98% or 99%. It isn't good to have your tissue saturated with oxygen because that is competing against the carbon dioxide. You should keep your oxygen and carbon dioxide in a good balance.

**Patrick Timpone:** That is opposite of what we are told. We are told the higher number is better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you put your finger in warm water, you'll tend to have a lower saturation. I've experimented putting my fingers in cold water and it goes right up to 100% saturation. If you aren't using the oxygen, it will simply show a high saturation in your extremities. You want to be using the oxygen and making carbon dioxide. I think the average person ought to be around 93% to 95% saturation.

**Patrick Timpone:** If we are at 98 or 99, what would we do to move that down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would suggest relaxing and paying attention to how your body feels. If you are having a thought of things you have to do, that can tend to make you hyperventilate. Just by being anxious and hyperventilating, you breathe so fast you are blowing out too much carbon dioxide. All by itself, that will raise your lactic acid because carbon dioxide suppresses that wasteful use of sugar and protein.

Taking thyroid makes you breathe harder, but it's doing it by producing more carbon dioxide, which stimulates breathing. So the amount of oxygen you are moving isn't the question; it's how you are using that oxygen.

## Thyroid Health and TSH

**Patrick Timpone:** Is body temperature still one of your main ways to look at the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Just getting in a warm bath can solve a lot of things. If you are sure you are keeping the energy up—having some orange juice or milk and sugar to make sure you don't get low blood sugar—warming your body will improve your metabolism and lower inflammation by getting the carbon dioxide produced.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do body temperature and TSH normally correlate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very often, if the TSH doesn't easily increase your thyroid secretion, the TSH keeps rising. When it acts on other cells, the first thing it does is excite the thyroid gland. That should produce T4 and T3, which keep the TSH down at a moderate level. But if the gland isn't responding, the TSH keeps rising. TSH has an irritating, stimulating action on other cells, such as blood vessels and bone marrow cells. It will create a generalized inflammation. A lot of circulatory problems, like hypertension, are caused directly by too much TSH rather than by too little thyroid hormone.

**Patrick Timpone:** If people are working with a doctor and using TSH numbers, are they on solid ground?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I keep seeing people being diagnosed exclusively on the basis of their TSH. You have to look at the whole metabolism and how many calories they are eating. You can't be hyperthyroid and maintain your body weight on 1800 calories a day. I keep seeing people treated for years with a thyroid suppressive drug when their metabolic rate is already too slow. Stress hormones will lower the TSH, so it looks like you are hypothyroid, but you are really just under stress.

Looking at large populations, one study found that people with a TSH of 0.4 and below were free of thyroid cancer. As their TSH went up, so did the incidence of thyroid cancer.

## Diet: Protein and PUFAs

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you map out some bullet points for thyroid health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have seen people on a raw vegetable diet—eating lots of undercooked or raw broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and soybeans—developing multiple endocrine problems. Just by adding eggs, milk, and orange juice, their pituitary function came back to normal.

Besides raw vegetables, the two most important things for damaging thyroid function are:
1.  **Protein deficiency:** People sometimes get along on 20 or 25 grams of protein a day, but that isn't enough to keep your energy running at the proper high rate.
2.  **Polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs):** Even on an ideal diet, they tend to accumulate. Nuts, seeds, fatty fish, poultry, and pork are generally rich in PUFAs because of what the animals are fed.

PUFAs inhibit the secretion of the thyroid hormone, interfere with transport, and block the actions of the thyroid hormone in the tissues. At the same time, PUFAs intensify the actions of estrogen. Estrogen is a major inhibitor of thyroid secretion. Ultimately, PUFAs tend to degrade the mitochondria that produce carbon dioxide.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are your favorite proteins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The National Academy of Science found that even medium-sized people at desk work needed at least 100 grams of protein a day to work efficiently. The trouble is that the highest quality proteins are rich in methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan. These happen to be potentially toxic, excitatory amino acids.

Ideally, you would get more gelatin-like amino acids. Gelatin lacks those toxic amino acids. Milk happens to have anti-stress factors and proteins that counter the stress which the excitatory amino acids would promote. The high calcium content of milk is the most important anti-stress factor.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is gelatin best for older people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For an old person, that's the best because it doesn't support tumor growth. When you are growing up, until 25 or so, you need the full protein like milk, cheese, and eggs.

**Patrick Timpone:** Regarding animal foods, fatty fish, pork, and chicken tend to have more PUFAs because of what they are fed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Soybeans and corn have a very high proportion of unsaturated fats. During the 1940s, it was discovered that those grains produced the best weight gain per dollar in animals because they suppress the thyroid.

**Patrick Timpone:** How can you find eggs that are worth eating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My friends in Mexico would feed their kitchen scraps to the chickens—meat scraps and leftover tortillas with the fat removed. Their eggs were super. As the polyunsaturated fat content goes down, the cholesterol tends to increase and the taste is better. Supermarket eggs labeled high in Omega-3 often have a fishy taste because flaxseed is used as a supplement.

## Vaccines and Immunity

**Patrick Timpone:** Your current newsletter is on the history and mechanism of vaccination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It relates to how the immune system works. Most vaccines create a local inflammation at the site of injection using aluminum or other antigens. That local inflammation leads to the delivery of these irritants to the brain and reproductive organs, causing chronic symptoms. It is generally recognized that inflammation during pregnancy changes the way the fetus's brain develops.

**Patrick Timpone:** We've been told that vaccines disrupt the innate immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was in graduate school, the innate immune system was considered primitive and irrelevant. They focused on antibodies. But now it is coming out that the antibody system is a desperate last measure of immunity, promoted by estrogen and stress hormones. Meanwhile, the innate immune system actually does learn and is adaptive.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the innate immune system gets stronger as it is exposed to substances?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Natural exposure is through the skin, lungs, or digestive system, definitely not through the muscle via injection. Studies in India have shown that Vitamin A can reduce infectious disease on a level comparable to vaccines. Vitamin D is the other essential immune-supporting nutrient. If you simply gave everyone good nutrition, you wouldn't have epidemics.

**Patrick Timpone:** How does the antibody theory work with vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen promotes the B cells which produce antibodies, whereas progesterone supports the thymus gland and the T cells, which have intelligent adaptability. Estrogen promotes autoimmunity. Women have five or 10 times the incidence of autoimmune diseases as men because of this influence. The fact that vaccines work exclusively on that system shouldn't be surprising that autoimmune diseases are the fastest growing in the population.

**Patrick Timpone:** How does this affect a 50-year-old versus a child?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That should have been studied in aging animals, but those studies haven't been done. In 1986, the government passed a law saying drug companies have no liability for harm done by vaccines. HHS pledged to improve safety but admitted 30 years later they had done nothing. Many safety studies used the vaccine minus one antigen as the control—meaning the control contained the toxic adjuvants. They were comparing a known toxin against the vaccine.

## Listener Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** Are thyroid nodules reversible? And do you know a good source for desiccated thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know of any well-defined, reliable glandular product now. Armour changed their recipe. I've heard the fewest bad things about WP and Nature-Throid, but I haven't used them. I use a synthetic designed to be equivalent to the old Armour called CynoPlus. It is a mixture of T4 and T3. It is available in Mexico.

Regarding nodules: Yes, they are reversible. I've known people who supplemented only T4, which suppresses the gland but doesn't give the metabolic effect. One person added T3 to their T4 supplement, and within about three weeks, the nodules had shrunk.

**Patrick Timpone:** Opinion on melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body produces a fraction of a milligram. Even a 1mg dose is unphysiological. 5 or 10mg is risky. In animals, melatonin rises in winter due to darkness and causes the gonads and thymus to regress. If one is going to supplement, use very small doses, a tenth to a fourth of a milligram.

**Patrick Timpone:** Advice on constant stomach noises?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's good. If you are anxious, things go quiet. As soon as you relax, your intestine gets lively.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener has sinus issues triggered by cold, wind, and ice cream. She takes progesterone, B3, thyroid, and follows your diet, but still has issues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes it is the lack of a carrot salad. Carrots are antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. They stimulate the intestine while binding toxins such as estrogen secreted in the bile, preventing reabsorption. Having a good-sized carrot salad every day can shift your hormones significantly, reducing sinus inflammation.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener has half a thyroid gland left and is on Synthroid (T4). Is the other half sufficient?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It generally regrows and is adequate, but the T4 will tend to keep it suppressed. That is okay if your liver is able to turn T4 into T3. You have to have steady blood sugar to convert T4 into the active T3. Women are more likely than men to have a problem with just T4.

**Patrick Timpone:** How long can one expect to live following these ideas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the most important thing is the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), which block your ability to respond to thyroid hormone. If you minimize intake and activate elimination, I think life should be able to go on indefinitely. That is the basic motor of aging.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are nuts a good idea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nuts are generally high in PUFAs, except Macadamia. Macadamia nuts are the lowest I know of.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you increase starch and sugar to reduce fat intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Orange juice, tropical fruits (the sweet ones rather than starchy), and nixtamalized grains such as tortillas and tamales. Ancient cultures discovered cooking grains in lye or lime ashes (cal). The alkali turns the fat into soap, which you wash away. It partly digests the protein, increasing nutritional quality (niacin), and makes the carbohydrates less likely to feed bacteria.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you eat bread?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not for 40 years. About 50 years ago, I made bread by soaking the flour for 12 hours until the gluten was essentially gone. I would make a batter and bake it at a high temperature. It made a delicious, non-toxic bread.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about cryotherapy or cold showers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your thyroid function is low, getting cold can slow things down even more and put you into an inflammatory state. When your feet are around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, they start producing inflammatory signals. A cold bath in that situation can make things worse.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a link between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Adrenaline, histamine, and serotonin rise during hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia and oxygen deficiency are almost identical in the harm they do. They bring up inflammatory stress hormones and cause heart rhythm problems. Keeping sugar stable is important. Re-breathing in a paper bag to increase carbon dioxide can lower stress, anxiety, and arrhythmia signals by suppressing lactic acid.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about alcohol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In some physics labs, they found that ethanol at a very small amount is a powerful antioxidant. The amount it takes is on the order of a teaspoon to a tablespoon per day.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about molecular hydrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We have enzymes called dehydrogenases which can use hydrogen. I think the hydrogen molecule can be handled by enzymes that handle NADH and transmit energy. It can be constructive by reducing inflammation.

**Patrick Timpone:** Intermittent fasting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think it is beneficial. If you have a high metabolic rate, going 20 hours without food can bring on stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** Does boiling water damage gelatin powder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, they are very stable.

**Patrick Timpone:** How to break out of chronic inflammatory patterns?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid (specifically T3), orange juice, and milk are the quickest ways.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about peanut butter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago, they found that about 30% of peanut butter samples contained aflatoxin, a very toxic fungal metabolite. That risk is enough reason to avoid it.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thank you for being here.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye bye.
