## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** We're going to have fun now. We are talking to Dr. Ray Peat, and it is great to have him on the show again. We've been inviting him about once a month, and he keeps saying yes. He is a renowned nutritional counselor. He acquired a PhD from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He started his work on hormones in 1968 and wrote his dissertation in 1972, where he outlined his ideas on progesterone and hormones. Closely related to this, his main thesis is that energy and structure are independent at every level. Dr. Ray Peat, good morning, sir. How are you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Patrick Timpone:** You always sound good, Doc. What did you have for breakfast this morning?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee, milk, and orange juice.

## Milk and Lactose Adaptation

**Patrick Timpone:** I like your breakfasts. It's funny, after hanging out with you and doing these shows, I started thinking, "I'm going to try some milk too." I have access to raw goat's milk. I never did really well with it my whole life, but I'm doing great with it now after a couple of months. I'm wondering what could change in the body? If I wasn't able to do even raw goat's milk before, what would change to make it work for me now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body is always changing to adapt to circumstances. They've done experiments with people who thought they were intolerant of lactose. By introducing an ounce or two—or three or four ounces—of milk per day, within their tolerance, they found that in a few weeks, even lactose-intolerant people were able to drink regular amounts of milk. The enzymes take a couple of weeks to adapt. That applies to any food. When you change to a different kind of major energy source, your intestine takes weeks to really adjust to it.

**Patrick Timpone:** So if you are going to change and introduce something that you haven't had for a while, it would be best to go just a little bit every day and let the body know what's going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, you give it signals of what's happening, and it starts making new enzymes to handle the new material. That happens most easily when you have all of the essential nutrients in adequate amounts and your thyroid is working efficiently so that you have lots of energy to do the new protein synthesis.

## Milk Composition: Iron and Calcium

**Patrick Timpone:** Is milk that good of a food for folks to even consider?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The only major deficiency it has is iron. During pregnancy, high estrogen causes the woman to absorb iron with extreme efficiency—I think they say nine or ten times more efficiently than a man extracting it from food. That charges up the woman's body with high amounts of iron. The baby is born overloaded with iron stores; their liver stores enough iron for almost a year of life living on milk. Milk lets them adjust to that newborn state of iron excess. It is designed to be deficient in iron, so you can't live indefinitely on just milk.

However, the estrogen also makes the woman absorb calcium very efficiently because the bones of the baby are going to require lots of calcium. So, milk has an excess of calcium for adult requirements. It turns out that even in an adult who doesn't need it for growing bones, that excess of calcium has a very powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-stress effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** I have access to raw cream, too. To take a big hit of that, like an ounce or two, sure feels good.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have good coffee with fresh heavy cream, that's delicious.

## Nighttime Stress and Sleep

**Patrick Timpone:** If you have warm milk or cream before bed, and it soothes you, that goes a long way, doesn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. During the night, the lack of light causes a developing stress. After about the age of 30, all of the changes related to aging happen during the night because of the stress that requires sleeping to get through it. The pituitary hormones all zoom up during the night—growth hormone, the gonadotropic hormones, and cortisol.

The parathyroid hormone rises during the night, and it exacerbates things because it inhibits energy production, which makes you need the cortisol. The combination of parathyroid hormone and cortisol rising very steeply during the night takes your energy down and breaks down your bones. Morning urine is full of the calcium that you've torn out of your bones during the night. Experimenters have found that milk at bedtime greatly lowers the night stress and prevents some of the surge of those stress hormones.

**Patrick Timpone:** Maybe that's where the old idea of warm milk at night comes from.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably.

## Goat Milk vs. Cow Milk

**Patrick Timpone:** Gandhi did pretty well, and I think he lived on goat's milk. Do you know any big difference between goat's milk and cow's milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has several differences. Partly it's because of the goat's favored diet; they won't eat everything. Basically, it's creamier, and the cream is emulsified in a different way, so it's slower to separate. This makes it easier to digest for a lot of people.

## Brain Development and Fats

**Patrick Timpone:** I was on a call with a doctor regarding a blood test, and he said I could use some more fat in my brain. How can people make sure we're getting plenty of good fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The interesting thing is that if the mother keeps her blood sugar up, babies make their own fat. It is all saturated, except for the polyunsaturated omega-9 fatty acids that are synthesized in the baby's liver. Babies are born with a highly saturated brain. In that state, in their first few years—when the brain contains only our native polyunsaturated fats and lots of saturated fats—they have their highest metabolic rate and a tremendous rate of learning. By the age of five or six, they know five or six thousand words. Imagine an adult trying to learn five or six thousand words in five years.

**Patrick Timpone:** Wow. So how do we humans pony up on more of that good fat in our brain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar. Just like a baby.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starch and sugar both turn to fat when you eat enough of them.

## Pork and Fat Quality

**Patrick Timpone:** What would be the difference between having coconut milk ice cream with sugar versus some really well-tended pork fat? Does the brain like them equally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It actually prefers saturated fat. But since our diets have been industrialized, pigs now have highly unsaturated fat. For about 50 years, the Department of Agriculture published lists calling pork fat, or lard, a saturated fat. But it turned out to be extremely polyunsaturated because they feed them so much soy and corn to make them fat. Those polyunsaturated corn and soy oils are highly fattening. Coconut oil is more like natural human fat; it is not so fattening.

**Patrick Timpone:** There is a person at the farmers market who feeds their pigs food thrown away at Whole Foods—mostly vegetables and grass.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone used to feed their pigs that way. When I was a kid, the creameries would make cheese and give away huge amounts of whey. The farmers would mix whey with apple crops or waste vegetables and fruit. That was really an ideal diet: milk protein, fruit, and vegetables.

**Patrick Timpone:** She was saying there's a huge difference between what she's doing and standard pigs. Even if you get organic pork, you don't know what they're feeding them; it could be organic soy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I used to really like pork when I lived in Mexico because the farmers would feed them that sort of food. When I was a kid, my grandmother sent me to the store to buy lard for her cooking. At room temperature, it sat in square cubes, just like butter—nice and solid. The last time I saw lard in a meat store, it was almost liquid.

## Milk Processing and Fat Content

**Patrick Timpone:** Here's an email: "Is reduced-fat, ultra-filtered milk that is lactose-free good to drink?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can be if there are no serious additives in it. They put an enzyme in that breaks lactose down into glucose and another monosaccharide. It's a perfectly good sugar and makes it taste sweeter.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there an issue with drinking organic, grass-fed milk that has been homogenized and pasteurized? Is that a negative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not really.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you recommend folks get as high a fat content as they can in the milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, you can get fat. I used to drink a gallon a day of whole milk when I was working easily. But when I became sedentary going to school, I started getting fat on that, so I reduced it to 1%. I could drink a gallon of 1% milk without getting fat. One of the virtues of milk is that the high calcium content stimulates heat production, the same way sodium, protein, and sugar stimulate your metabolism. Calcium is a major factor in maintaining a high metabolic rate.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it the calcium that gets into the mitochondria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both sodium and calcium stimulate the cell to counteract their stimulating effect. The rising energy production relaxes the cell, but in the process, it burns up a lot of energy.

## Thyroid Health and Diagnosis

**Patrick Timpone:** One of the biggest complaints when people go to the doctor is low energy. Talk a bit about that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mostly that turns out to be a low thyroid state. Even in the 30s and 40s, experts estimated that probably 40% of the population was practically hypothyroid. Since then, the diet has deteriorated. Using those same standards, probably 60% or 80% of people are suffering from hypothyroidism.

However, the standards for measuring it have changed since the 1940s to revise the definition of "normal." The standard they use now is TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). What they overlook is that the stress caused by hypothyroidism and bad diet produces stress hormones that lower TSH, the same way an excessive thyroid hormone would. So, a stressed, tired, low-energy person will have very low TSH production because of the stress hormones.

**Patrick Timpone:** Wow.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Quite a few people have had a diagnosis of *hyperthyroidism* because their TSH is so low, but their symptoms—water retention, fatigue, hair loss—are typical of hypothyroidism. Several people have told me, "I'm both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid." It makes absolutely no sense, but doctors are actually saying that.

**Patrick Timpone:** Which marker should people pay attention to?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's good to look at all of them, but Free T3, Free T4, and TSH are all ambiguous under stress. I look at:
*   Is hemoglobin and hematocrit up to normal?
*   Is cholesterol above normal?
*   Are liver enzymes a little bit off-center?

Temperature and heart rate are pretty good indicators. The real indicator that was abandoned after the pharmaceutical companies took over in the 40s was measuring actual oxygen consumption and heat production. If a person was only burning two-thirds as much energy as a healthy person, they were given a thyroid supplement to bring their oxygen consumption up to normal, and their symptoms went away.

Women who diet a lot have been found to maintain their weight on 700 calories a day because of low thyroid function, instead of the textbook 1,700 calories.

## Anxiety and Stress Hormones

**Patrick Timpone:** It's fair to say that stress and angst change a lot of things in the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid people chronically have anxiety. When energy production goes down—which happens to everyone during the night—the body compensates with increased adrenaline and cortisol. When your thyroid is chronically low, you run around in the daytime with elevated adrenaline and cortisol. I've seen people with several times the normal amount of adrenaline production. Some people can function normally with four times as much adrenaline as normal, but that's why some low thyroid people tend to get anxious or have atrial fibrillation. Especially at sunset, when stress hormones normally rise, a low thyroid person can go into a very anxious, worrying state.

## Sleep and Mitochondria

**Patrick Timpone:** Why do stress hormones come out at night?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments on rabbits in Leningrad found that as soon as the lights were turned out, the mitochondria started swelling. Halfway through the long winter night, the mitochondria were extremely enlarged. About 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, they started exploding, collapsing, and stopping energy production altogether.

In humans, there was a study where they took blood samples every 15 minutes during the night. They found that when they turned the lights out, within 15 minutes there was a rise in cortisol. For those who went to sleep, the rise was much slower than if they stayed awake. So, sleep is a way of reducing our need for cortisol.

**Patrick Timpone:** We've been told it's beneficial to go to bed early, like 10:00 PM versus 1:00 or 2:00 AM. Is there something to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. People who spent the summer months in Antarctica, where daylight is constant, said they felt the best of their lives and didn't feel that nighttime stress. Getting to sleep early minimizes the stress of nighttime.

## Light Therapy (Red/Infrared)

**Patrick Timpone:** What about near-infrared lights?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Infrared is basically heat. It helps keep your metabolic rate up just by staying warm. However, red light at the fairly narrow band from orange to red passes right through water without heating it. When it runs into a blue protein or blue enzyme—we have quite a few containing copper—the red light is absorbed. Under stress, free radicals reduce that blue copper. The red light re-oxidizes the copper, putting the mitochondria back to work because the copper enzymes are the final enzyme of the mitochondrial energy-producing system.

**Patrick Timpone:** So red lights can be beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, within just a minute or two, they can restore enzyme activity. They've measured rats' cognitive ability and oxygen consumption in their brains just by shining red light through their head. It restores mitochondrial oxidation very quickly.

**Patrick Timpone:** We're hearing a lot about the 600 to 800 nanometer range.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 600 to 700 is the most important band.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you shine it in your eyes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Experiments with welders who burned their eyes with ultraviolet light found almost instant pain relief when they looked at red light. Also, experimenters gave frogs a deadly dose of gamma rays. When they gave them red light immediately after the radiation, it didn't kill them. The red light restored the enzymes that would have led to fatal inflammation.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener writes: "I fall asleep well with my chicken light shining on me."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That looks like an ordinary incandescent bulb, but they are designed to run on 130 volts. On standard 120-volt lines, they are less blue-oriented and richer in red light. I have one over my head all the time.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a benefit to the more expensive 600-800nm lights versus the cheap "chicken lamp" bulbs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the $5 ones are fine. Even with serious neurological diseases, they can help restore mitochondria.

## Circulation and Inflammation

**Patrick Timpone:** Jerome in Germany, age 65, asks about numbness in his toes and feet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With age, one of the things that becomes chronic is inflammation from slow digestion. The intestine releases inflammatory signals into the bloodstream. The nerves that pass through the pelvic area are being poisoned by the intestine emitting serotonin, histamine, nitric oxide, and endotoxin into the general pelvic area. This can affect the bladder and poison the nerves and blood vessels passing through the pelvis, slowing down circulation and energy production in the legs and feet.

**Patrick Timpone:** What can he do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The accumulation of polyunsaturated fat in the tissue means that any inflammation—for example, from a green salad, which isn't digestible by humans and feeds bacteria—will produce things that activate inflammation. The more polyunsaturated fat you have stored, the more inflammatory prostaglandins (especially PGE2) will be produced.

Cutting your polyunsaturated fats or using aspirin chronically can help. Aspirin will block the formation of prostaglandins and reduce that amplifying effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** How much aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Enough to make the symptoms go away. If you are going to do it chronically, especially if you have used antibiotics and disturbed intestinal bacteria, you want to make sure your diet has some Vitamin K. Chronic aspirin use can cause excess bleeding. I noticed that if I scratched myself, I would bleed longer. So I took Vitamin K, and now I can take aspirin—1,000 milligrams a day—without bleeding abnormalities. If you eat liver two or three times a month, you get the whole range of Vitamin K.

## Protein Powders vs. Gelatin

**Patrick Timpone:** Carol asks if you prefer certain types of protein powders.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Powdered proteins contain two or three amino acids that are very unstable. When they break down, they can produce inflammatory toxins. Cysteine and tryptophan are the worst for breaking down during processing. The only protein that doesn't have these unstable amino acids is gelatin.

**Patrick Timpone:** Just gelatin from the store?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It isn't a complete protein for a growing animal, but an adult who isn't growing has a very small requirement for tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine. If you reduce methionine alone in an adult animal's diet, experiments found a 40% extension of lifespan. Gelatin is a good source.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about taking tyrosine, cysteine, and 5-HTP for Parkinson's and sleep.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think 5-HTP is good at all; it can lead to increased inflammation. Cysteine produces inflammation and can damage mitochondria. Tyrosine is okay in moderation; it leads to adrenaline. But gelatin has a generous amount of the precursors to adrenaline and dopamine.

**Patrick Timpone:** Where do you get gelatin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Great Lakes Gelatin is an old company. 30 grams a day is fine. The soluble one (green label) is easier to dissolve.

## Blood Glucose and Pulse Rate

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener's fasting blood glucose came back at 127. Should he be concerned?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wouldn't be concerned, but you should pay attention to temperature, pulse rate, and cholesterol. In the long range, glucose will probably come down when thyroid function is optimal.

**Patrick Timpone:** Talk about the pulse rate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When adrenaline rises to compensate for low thyroid, it prevents the very slow pulse rate of classical hypothyroidism. Often a person waking up in the morning when cortisol is high will have a racing heart which slows to normal after breakfast.

Healthy, high-IQ kids in studies had around an 85 beats per minute pulse rate. Studies on older people found that pulse rate varied with IQ. Very low thyroid people have lower mental functioning. They tested people with heart implants: when they turned the stimulator up from 70 to 85 beats per minute, mental functions, calculation, and memory increased.

**Patrick Timpone:** So as thyroid gets more in balance, pulse rate generally increases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in the range of 80 to 90 is good for most people. That tends to go with a stable blood sugar around 90 and stable blood pressure around 120/80.

## Thyroid Supplementation and Magnesium

**Patrick Timpone:** If someone starts supplementing thyroid, what happens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first week or two, if you are running on adrenaline, the thyroid feels like speed—it makes you anxious. But if you go very slow, like a fourth of the standard dose for several weeks, you'll find your pulse slowing down and temperature creeping up. When you are fully oxidizing energy, it relaxes the nerves and muscles.

However, increasing thyroid requires magnesium. Cells begin making more energy and need to retain magnesium because it binds to ATP. A low thyroid person is breaking down ATP because there isn't enough magnesium to stabilize it. If you don't have a good reserve of magnesium, increasing thyroid just increases stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is a reasonable dose of magnesium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the first few days, a gram or two of magnesium carbonate is okay. But a good diet—coffee, milk, orange juice, meat, and fish—are all good magnesium sources.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is T3 different from standard thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. T3 works within seconds if you chew it, or maximally in an hour and a half if swallowed. It fades off quickly, losing half its activity in 12 hours. You can't take it just once a day because of the ups and downs. That's why glandular powder is often better.

## Supplements and Gut Health

**Patrick Timpone:** Ellen asks about Chlorella.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wouldn't touch it. All of those organisms have irritating components, and the lakes can become contaminated with toxic versions. Same caution for Spirulina.

**Patrick Timpone:** Gio asks about bloating caused by sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That indicates slow digestion. Bacteria should stay in the colon, but when digestion is slow, they move up into the small intestine (SIBO). Bacteria in the small intestine will eat sugar before you can absorb it, producing gas. The first thing is to accelerate the transit of food. Thyroid is the main thing behind the energetic quality of the intestine.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about turpentine for the stomach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since I was a kid, people put a drop on a sugar cube. I think it's basically harmless, though you can be allergic to it. You have to ensure it is pure gum spirits of turpentine, not the stuff from the hardware store which can be gasoline.

## Iodine and Digestion

**Patrick Timpone:** Leslie asks about iodine. Should she take it daily?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Milk and eggs are guaranteed sources of iodine because cows and chickens stop producing if they are deficient. Seafood is also a good source.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you test digestive enzymes by putting food in a solution?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not really. Experiments showed that enzymes in a test tube were extremely slow. But when they added a piece of intestine lining, the reaction went at top rate. The enzymes need to be laid out on the fuzzy lining of the intestine to work properly.

## Progesterone

**Patrick Timpone:** What source of progesterone do you suggest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The kind I designed is Progest-E complex. It is progesterone in an oily solution that works well through the skin and orally.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there any reason for men to look at progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Stress hormones cause testosterone to turn into estrogen. Progesterone and pregnenolone stop the formation of estrogen from testosterone. At small doses, progesterone frees up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking the stress conversion to estrogen. However, a large dose (like 100mg) can have an anti-androgen effect. I took 100mg for a migraine once; the headache stopped, but the following day I didn't have any whisker growth.

## Potatoes

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you tell us about the protein and Vitamin C content of potatoes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies on Pacific Islanders found they were healthy eating nothing but potatoes for 50 weeks of the year. Potatoes seem to have low protein by analysis, but in animal feeding experiments, the protein turned out to be higher quality than egg yolk.

This is because the potato juice contains keto acid versions of essential amino acids. As soon as the body absorbs them, any available ammonia attaches to the keto acid, turning it into an essential amino acid. They are also a good source of Vitamin C, B vitamins, and most minerals, though low in B12 and iron.

## Calcium and Hair Loss

**Patrick Timpone:** What about eggshell calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the next best thing to milk. It is calcium carbonate. If it isn't finely ground, it can be irritating.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about regrowing hair lost due to digestive disorders.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is an association between hair loss and heart disease due to stress hormones. High parathyroid hormone (PTH) is very destructive to the hair follicle. Lowering PTH with Vitamin D and calcium is probably the most protective thing for both heart disease and hair follicles.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you elaborate on why calcium forms harmful plaque?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the same mechanism. Parathyroid hormone blocks mitochondrial metabolism and turns on lactic acid production. Lactic acid takes calcium out of the bones, and in the process, shifts the balance to deposit it in soft tissues where it shouldn't be. Increasing calcium in the diet lowers PTH and protects against calcification.

## Hydrogen and Carbonated Water

**Patrick Timpone:** We were talking about a machine that makes hydrogen gas for water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it would be good to experiment with carbonated water combined with your hydrogen water. I would bet it would be about twice as effective.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the science behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen and carbonated water, found that carbonated water and CO2 gas alleviated breast cancer and healed ulcers. The Japanese are currently using it experimentally against cancer. There is a thin line of research suggesting we can assimilate gaseous hydrogen from the environment for energy.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, we burned through it. Thank you for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
