## Introduction

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Raymond Peat has been kind enough to come on the show from time to time the last few months. He has a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and others. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968. His website is RayPeat.com. Good morning, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning. Just as I came on, I heard you talking about genetically modified food. That is something everyone should be very concerned about. Did you talk about the research of Seralini, Surov, and Baranova?

**Patrick Timpone:** I haven't heard those names. Talk about that.

## GMOs and Epigenetics

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Baranova and Surov fed different combinations of modified grains to hamsters. They found that with each generation, the symptoms were worse, until the third generation was sterile. That's something biologists have been covering up for at least 50 years—probably much longer. When something mildly harmful persists beyond one generation, it is intensified every generation. Even without modifying or mutating genes, it accumulates epigenetic changes and alters the course of development. In just three generations of eating whatever had gone wrong with that grain, the animals were sterile.

**Patrick Timpone:** So they gave animals GMO grain and by the third generation, they were sterile?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, most had very small litters, and the few that survived were sterile. Similar experiments were done 50 or 60 years ago. They would make a small nick in the egg of a frog, and there would be slight changes as that animal grew up, but its offspring would be even more damaged. The third generation wouldn't be able to reproduce at all.

**Patrick Timpone:** Through what mechanism does that work epigenetically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mechanists say that if it doesn't change your genes, it doesn't hurt you, because they claim everything is permanently built into the genesis. They believe you simply print out what is inherited. But that isn't the way life works. That was a dogma starting in 1890 called Neo-Darwinism.

Until about 1975 or 1980, doctors insisted that a woman could be starved, stressed, or very sick, but as long as the baby stayed in the uterus, it wouldn't be affected. In fact, animal experiments showed that if your grandmother was stressed or poorly nourished, your health is going to be affected. The whole body changed its form—smaller brain, higher blood pressure—for generations after a serious stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** So we know that with ongoing dietary and lifestyle changes, genes express themselves differently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Everything is constantly being checked against what's going on elsewhere in the organism and its environment. Our genes are constantly being expressed according to the present situation. The doctrine of immutable genes was a fantasy imposed for political reasons.

This has positive implications, too. A group in Berkeley in 1960 gave lab animals playgrounds instead of little boxes. The parents grew up happier and slightly more intelligent, but the offspring were even more intelligent. The third generation had bigger brains than had ever been measured before.

## Silicon Dioxide and Supplements

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there anything in particular that has been top of mind for you recently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For years I've noticed that drugs, nutritional supplements, foods, and cosmetics are being modified for the manufacturer's ease with silicon dioxide powder. I finally decided to bring together some concrete information about that.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is silicon dioxide something we definitely want to keep out of our bodies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I don't buy any supplement that contains particulate matter, such as titanium dioxide or silicon dioxide.

**Patrick Timpone:** Most sulfur or MSM products sold contain silicon dioxide. Why do they use it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It makes the product easier to manufacture and package. It's a lubricant. It isn't an ingredient of food, but it can be used as a lubricant on the machinery used for packaging. One product is called "food grade lubricant," and it contains silica and the monomers of Teflon. They don't have to mention it in the ingredients when it's used as a "processing aid."

**Patrick Timpone:** What does silicon dioxide do in the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The size of the particle determines the effect. Amorphous silica is inflammatory and eventually fibrogenic and carcinogenic. A particle of a certain size is interpreted by the cell's inflammasome the same way as an asbestos crystal. As it gets smaller towards a nanoparticle, it becomes more toxic and enters cells more easily.

These particles pass through the wall of the intestine. Cells in the intestine are designed to sample antigens in the food, so they deliberately take up particles. However, they can't digest silica, so they accumulate it. Their immune function is gradually destroyed by accumulating this indigestible fibrous material.

**Patrick Timpone:** What are other common additives in supplements we should avoid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything other than sugar, salt, or other relatively pure edible substances shouldn't be there. For example, magnesium stearate. It sounds chemically like an edible substance, but it is manufactured and accumulates contaminants.

## Vitamin C: Synthetic vs. Natural

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there anything you take regularly to hedge your bets?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have stopped using any nutritional supplement orally. I found that I could consume gallons of orange juice—huge amounts of vitamin C—without issue. But the smallest amount of a vitamin C supplement gave me a bad cough, intestinal inflammation, and headaches. When I stopped taking it, those symptoms went away. It would take only about 2 milligrams of synthetic ascorbic acid to make me sick, whereas I could consume 4,000 milligrams of ascorbic acid in natural food forms.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you don't feel it's necessary to supplement vitamin C?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. After I stopped taking it, I checked how much ascorbic acid was coming out in my urine. I was excreting between 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams daily. I was extracting vitamin C from meat and milk. Nutrition charts show meat has very little ascorbic acid, but the same molecule in the oxidized form—dehydroascorbate—is concentrated in the cells. In the cells, ascorbic acid acts as an essential oxidant. We get this form in meat, eggs, and milk.

## Dairy and Canned Milk

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks: How does canned milk compare to fresh milk? And are goat milk and cheese good sources of calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cheeses are great sources of most nutrients—calcium, magnesium, B vitamins—though deficient in iron. Canned milk is slightly lower in vitamin C and some B vitamins. The main concern historically was lead soldering, which was corrected 20 or 30 years ago. However, you must be alert to can liners, as estrogenic plastics are sometimes used.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do some people do better on goat or sheep cheese?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the fat particle is more thoroughly homogenized in goat milk. Also, goats are pickier about what they eat, so it is a more certain source of nutrients like vitamin E because they don't like stale food.

## Thyroid and Diet History

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about thyroid supplementation. Is it daily? For life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1940, the US Agriculture Department declared that thyroid glands must be removed at the slaughterhouse. Before that, everyone who ate animal products—fish heads, organ meats, sausages containing glands—was getting thyroid in their diet every day. Suddenly, our meat supply was deprived of it. Milk became one of the rare sources because the mother puts hormones into the milk.

For example, after the Three Mile Island incident, women breathing leaking isotopes did not have thyroid-deficient babies as long as they were breastfeeding, because the milk provided the hormone.

## Mercury in Fish

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a concern with mercury when consuming fish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All food is getting mercury now because smoke circulates it around the world. However, studies found that the brightest kids had the highest mercury content, showing that if they are well-nourished, the mercury can pass through them.

Hans Selye did experiments poisoning animals with mercury until their kidneys were damaged. When he gave them a good dose of vitamin C combined with the mercury, their kidneys looked normal. He showed that mercury was reduced to a non-toxic form. A good balance of oxidizing and reducing substances—like flavonoids in fruits and vegetables—helps the body eliminate it.

## Grains and Sprouting

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks if soaking grains is similar to the lye process you talk about.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not exactly, but it is another way of creating a more nutritious product. If the grain hasn't been killed by heat, wetting it activates sprouting enzymes. The seed stores starch or oil for energy and concentrated nitrogen (arginine, lysine) to grow the sprout. When you activate those enzymes, you reduce toxic proteins and starches and increase the nutritional value. The alkali (lye) process doesn't activate the proteins, but it chemically reduces toxins and increases niacin.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can we do the lye process at home?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You cook it until it swells up and the husk comes off the seed.

## Caller: Thyroid Medication Not Working

**Mike (Caller):** I'm taking 30 milligrams of Armour Thyroid—about 10 pills a day—and I don't feel any heating. My lab reports say I'm within range, but I feel no change.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes, a pioneer in thyroid therapy, found that low thyroid regions had high rates of cancer and heart disease. He put his patients on thyroid supplements and in 30 years had no patient die of heart disease. His average dose was 120 milligrams (2 grains) of Armour Thyroid.

Barnes found several things interfere with thyroid. He would increase the dose while watching the patient's temperature. If the temperature didn't rise to normal (98.6°F after breakfast), he looked for interferences. Too much protein, specifically muscle meat rich in methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan, inhibits the thyroid. Calcium in milk protects against that anti-thyroid effect.

**Patrick Timpone:** Mike, have you checked for dental issues like cavitations? Even if you don't have root canals, old extraction sites can have infections on meridians that affect the thyroid.

**Mike (Caller):** My dental is good, no root canals. My pulse stays around 58 to 60.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people have stored enough polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in their tissues that it can take six months or more of thyroid supplementation before their tissues respond. The fats interfere with the use of glucose to activate thyroxine. Sometimes it takes a temporary large dose to get the system going.

## Heart Health and Inflammation

**Patrick Timpone:** What can we do for the heart muscle itself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Inflammation is the worst thing for the heart and arteries. Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) are the key to the inflammatory process. They convert to prostaglandins, which amplify any problem. This leads to the trapping of fatty acid esters of cholesterol. It isn't pure cholesterol that causes the problem; it's the accumulated fatty acid ester.

In animal experiments, a T3 (active thyroid) supplement would energize an enlarged, fibrous heart so it could clear out the excess collagen. Broda Barnes found that heart diseases were essentially prevented when patients were kept on the right amount of thyroid.

**Patrick Timpone:** Did he use T3 or a combo?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He used only Armour Thyroid. The industry convinced doctors that pure thyroxine was more scientific, but it isn't the same. Healthy young men can convert thyroxine to T3, but people under stress, aging, or with high estrogen cannot produce T3 adequately. Armour provides the T3 everyone needs during stress.

## Age Spots (Lipofuscin)

**Patrick Timpone:** How can we remove age spots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a woman who developed brown age spots after six months on an estrogen supplement. Within a few weeks of using progesterone, they disappeared. It was a sensitivity to estrogen excess.

In the brain, vitamin E can activate the removal of lipofuscin (age pigment). Eating vitamin E gets it into the bloodstream in the proper form to stop and reverse age pigment.

## Detox and Particles

**Patrick Timpone:** How much clay or charcoal should we use for detox?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1970s, Gerhard Volkheimer showed that particles up to 10 times the size of a red blood cell can pass through the intestine into the bloodstream. This includes charcoal, clay, and minerals. Particulate matter should be taken with food containing cellulose fiber, which prevents those particles from passing into the bloodstream.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about using a teaspoon of Clorox in water to soak vegetables?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, dilute Clorox disinfects. Ideally, you use hydrogen peroxide because it leaves no chemical residue.

## Gut Health and Reflux

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about navigating diet issues. Is it just trial and error?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone has a different internal ecology of bacteria. If you are low in thyroid, digestion is slow, allowing bacteria to live farther up the intestine than they should. Healthy people keep bacteria confined to the colon.

Using fibrous foods that are resistant to bacterial degradation helps control overgrowth. Raw carrots are an example; they contain antiseptics. A carrot salad—shredded carrot with olive or coconut oil, vinegar, and salt—acts as a broad-spectrum antiseptic for the intestine.

**Patrick Timpone:** Does stomach acid actually digest, or just keep bacteria down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both. But digestion requires the exact anatomy of the intestine—the micro-projections—along with the enzymes. People deficient in hydrochloric acid are usually malnourished and low thyroid. You need carbon dioxide (from thyroid metabolism) to produce stomach acid.

**Patrick Timpone:** So reflux could be tied to thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Reflux is a combination of irritation from bacteria/undigested food and low energy. When blood sugar drops at night, irritation causes reverse peristalsis—waves moving backward from the intestine to the stomach and esophagus.

## Fish Oil

**Patrick Timpone:** Why do doctors still prescribe fish oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You get an anti-inflammatory effect for about the first six months because the oxidized fragments are immunosuppressive. But eventually, the pro-oxidative effect dominates.

The brain accumulates polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) starting around puberty. By old age, the percentage of PUFA in the brain is very high. A young brain that learns well has very little PUFA accumulated.

## Orange Juice and Sugar

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener is concerned about the fructose in orange juice being equivalent to soda.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fructose is in some ways better than glucose because it doesn't stimulate insulin secretion; cells can take it up without insulin. Problems arise in experiments where they feed a diet high in PUFA combined with excess fructose. The PUFA blocks the proper handling of sugar. If we deprive ourselves of PUFA, our bodies handle sugars properly.

**Patrick Timpone:** Should we check fasting blood sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your thyroid is good and you didn't overeat protein at bedtime, stress hormones rise only slightly during the night. If sugar is used up, cortisol and adrenaline rise in the morning, causing high morning glucose. Eating fruit or milk helps keep morning cortisol to a minimum.

## Sleep and Cortisol

**Patrick Timpone:** How can we lower cortisol at night for better sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A fibrous diet helps. Irritation in the intestine escapes control when blood sugar dips. A mild fibrous food in the afternoon—like a carrot salad or cooked mushrooms/bamboo shoots—protects against irritation. Aspirin late in the day reduces inflammation. Having carbohydrate like orange juice or milk with sugar at bedtime helps maintain sleep and reduce the cortisol rise.

## Accessory Thyroids

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about accessory thyroid glands. Are they effective if the primary gland is removed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes, but you don't want to count on it. Starting in the 1930s, the Cleveland Clinic realized thyroidectomy wasn't the right approach. By the time George Crile Jr. took over, they were doing almost no thyroid surgeries. They would supplement with thyroid to suppress TSH, allowing patients to live perfectly well without surgery.

## High Blood Pressure

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener has high barium and high blood pressure. Suggestions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have many articles showing that it is very common to cure high blood pressure simply by correcting thyroid function.

## Grapefruit Juice

**Patrick Timpone:** Does grapefruit juice have the same benefits as orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Early studies suggesting estrogenic effects likely used under-ripened grapefruit. Good, sweet grapefruits have a protective, pro-thyroid effect similar to orange juice. When thyroid is working right, it keeps estrogen to a minimum.

## Stem Cells

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the best way to activate our own stem cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every night, the stress of darkness activates a surge of new stem cells. However, stress hormones and prostaglandins kill them as soon as they are born. In the pancreas, for example, PUFA and nitric oxide kill newly born beta cells. Sugar helps stem cells survive. It is a competition between polyunsaturated fats and glucose for whether the newly born cells will survive.

## Intermittent Fasting

**Patrick Timpone:** Is there a benefit to intermittent fasting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A healthy liver can store glycogen, so a healthy person can go 12 to 18 hours without eating. But if you have too much PUFA in your body, as soon as blood sugar dips, you pull PUFA into circulation and start damaging tissues.

**Patrick Timpone:** Does coffee help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Coffee, aspirin, and correcting thyroid help you go longer without food stress.

## Coffee and Decaf

**Patrick Timpone:** Does decaf coffee still have benefits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, if it is decaffeinated with carbon dioxide rather than solvents. Coffee contains potassium, magnesium, niacin, and B vitamins. It is a significant nutritional source.

## Thyroid Medication Shortages

**Patrick Timpone:** Listeners are having trouble finding Armour Thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Armour used to test every batch on mice for potency. In the 1990s, the company was sold and changed. There are other products using pure beef or pork thyroid. It's a matter of trying different products and monitoring pulse and temperature. The shortages are often powered by regulators; the FDA has been serving the pharmaceutical industry to remove traditional products.

## Triglycerides

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener lowered triglycerides to 400-500 mg but was prescribed high doses of Omega 3, 6, and 9. What can replace these?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Using orange juice instead of bread and starch can make a big difference. Starches stimulate triglyceride synthesis. Vegetables, orange juice, and anything that supports thyroid function will normalize triglycerides.

**Patrick Timpone:** Thanks for being here, Dr. Peat. The newsletter is available at RayPeatsNewsletter@gmail.com.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
