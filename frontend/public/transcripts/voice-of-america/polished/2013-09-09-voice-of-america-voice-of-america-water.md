## Introduction: The Power of Water

**Sharon Kleyne:** I want to invite you to listen to the Sharon Kleyne Hour: The Power of Water. For over 30 years, I have been studying water—not only the water on the surface of the earth and below it, but also water vapor and humidity. From the moment you were born, water vapor became the most important influence of your life. Without water on earth, there would be no water vapor or humidity for you to stay alive.

We are all dehydrating differently. The water vapor in the air, the water on the earth, and our cloud system all influence each other. I am coming to you from the Rogue River Valley in Southern Oregon, sitting on the famous Rogue River. Even here, amidst beautiful mountains and tall trees, we are having challenges with water.

There is no place in the world that uses more water per day than America. Between showering, using the bathroom, and brushing teeth, we typically use 30 gallons. A dishwasher takes 12 gallons; a washing machine takes 43 gallons. Watering the lawn takes 10 gallons per minute. By the time we go to bed, the average American has used 150 gallons of water a day.

Concerns about fresh water are serious. In China, 118 rivers are polluted. Steven Solomon, author of *Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power, and Civilization*, notes that water is overtaking oil as our scarcest natural resource. By 2030, the United States could be short 40% of the water we require. Vandana Shiva has written an excellent book on "Water Wars," and Dr. Neil Grigg has discussed water finance. Water will become the most expensive part of your life.

Today I have an exciting guest, Dr. Raymond Peat, a PhD from the University of Oregon. We will discuss aging, nutrition, and hormones.

## The Science of Water in Living Systems

**Sharon Kleyne:** Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us. You have a PhD in biology specializing in physiology, and you have continued your research since the 1970s. What has been your focus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started professional biology study in 1968, but before that, around 1950, I heard about Albert Szent-Györgyi. He went around the country doing demonstrations of living tissue and the state of water inside muscles. He showed that the condition of the water, as it affected molecules, changed instantaneously when a muscle was stimulated.

I looked around to see who else was working on that, and it was utterly neglected by professional biologists. Szent-Györgyi won a Nobel Prize for Vitamin C, but his real interest was in how the state of water changes between life and death. I had that in mind through the 60s. Later, Linus Pauling did research that lined up with Szent-Györgyi’s, proposing that anesthetics work by altering the state of water in cells.

The chemical community ignored Pauling, even though he had a Nobel Prize. After several years, I decided that despite the established academic science culture lacking interest in what I wanted to study, I would use their instruments to do my research without getting indoctrinated by their belief that everything is governed strictly by genes and membranes.

**Sharon Kleyne:** Why do you think they left so much of that study behind? Researchers like Lawrence Henderson and Gilbert Ling did enormous research on water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was a philosophical doctrine that took over, related to allopathic medicine. The "gene people" represented almost a religious line of thinking that hated to admit organisms were as complicated as they are. There is a book called *Cold War in Biology* that explains how there was a political campaign through American universities to direct thoughts toward genetic engineering—making it an industrial, manageable concept of how organisms work. They wanted to go from factories to doctors to what they could sell.

**Sharon Kleyne:** I agree. When I first launched a product for the skin, I was convinced the skin was dehydrating. Investors asked, "Can it be patented?" They left water behind because water is the primary reason we are alive, but they couldn't easily patent the description of water until recently. Do you think that is why they ignored it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is a matter of controlling products. In my first muscle physiology course, water was absolutely neglected. The membrane was there to keep water inside, but how water controlled chemical reactions was ignored.

However, Gerald Pollack at the University of Washington is now demonstrating amazing things. He shows that a surface organizes water and causes water to be in control of things dissolved in it at a tremendous distance from the surface. When you look back, those professors were crazy to ignore the power of water inside the cell.

**Sharon Kleyne:** I had a Nobel Prize winner on who told me it took him 25 years to prove there is water in the cell. They still don't want to admit that we are made of water. When research studies diseases, they don't look at dehydration first.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was a child, I asked why water was blue. People said it was the sky reflecting in it. But I was at Crater Lake on a cloudy day; the sky was gray, but the lake was just as blue as ever. The scientific culture claimed it was the sky, but Linus Pauling stated in a textbook that water is a blue substance. Science had this insane need to abstract things and say water basically isn't there.

## Forests and the Water Cycle

**Sharon Kleyne:** I went after the air we live in because I found they had ignored water vapor. There is an influence between body water, water vapor, the cloud system, and fresh water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The forests are a stabilizer of the whole water system. Groundwater and air water depend on the interaction of forests. Deforestation causes a terrible change in the water system. Part of the water system is the trunk of trees. The wood is moist, and channels allow moisture from inside the tree to come out into the leaves.

The bigger the trunk, the greater the reservoir of available water to put back into the air. If you cut down trees that are five feet in diameter and replace them with trees that are six inches in diameter, they are unstable regulators of atmospheric water. When humidity goes down, they aren't able to replenish it from these huge tanks of water in their trunks.

**Sharon Kleyne:** What happens to a healthy forest when you have dead trees and brush around it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Insects come in after the forest is dying because the immune system of the tree depends on good nourishment. Part of that nourishment comes from rotting old generations. It is like organic gardening; you put the residue back in the soil. A forest fire will reduce the brush to ashes, but the ashes feed the soil. If you haul out the lumber and burn it elsewhere, you are starving the forest soils by removing that organic mineral residue.

**Sharon Kleyne:** We need to understand that without water, people will take it for granted. As Peter Brabeck of Nestle said, water will become expensive because we have taken it for granted.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vandana Shiva has some important videos on this. She was trained as a physicist but realized nuclear energy wasn't going to help the planet, so she looked at the water economy.

## Hormones, Inflammation, and Water Retention

**Sharon Kleyne:** You have spent a lot of time studying progesterone and hormones. Can you explain how they function regarding stress and aging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The organism is mainly a system of protein molecules, fat, and nucleic acids. The protein changes its electrical properties according to the chemical reactions inside. It can change its acidity or alkalinity based on metabolism.

Any system with a lot of protein, like a sponge or Jell-O, will change the way it holds water according to acidity and alkalinity. Acidity makes it give up water; alkalinity makes it retain water. The metabolism of burning sugar in the presence of oxygen regulates this balance.

Edema, where feet or fingers swell, is the result of bad metabolism. Hormones get out of balance, changing the acidity/alkalinity so that water falls out of the cells and collects in the tissues under gravity.

The thyroid hormone is responsible for letting us use oxygen to produce energy, which maintains protective hormones like progesterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, and DHEA. Under stress, some testosterone or DHEA changes into estrogen. Estrogen tends to create the edema state. Thyroid and progesterone are the most powerful hormones in preserving the proper retention of water inside cells—not too much, not too little.

**Sharon Kleyne:** How does an individual know this is happening?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The aging process is essentially a loss of water. A baby has extremely high water content in its tissues—over 80%. In a very old person, it approaches 55%. Function decreases along with the water. A baby has a high metabolic rate and ability to heal. At puberty, vitality is at a maximum. After that, the ability to heal decreases, and the water content inside every cell decreases from conception to death.

## Nutrition and Aging

**Sharon Kleyne:** Tell us what you have learned about nutrition to help retain water and detoxify the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies showed that if you feed an animal saturated fat, such as coconut oil, the skin cells grow in an orderly way, retaining moisture and keeping skin firm. If you feed them polyunsaturated fats, they mature very quickly, as if under the influence of estrogen excess or Vitamin A deficiency. They are more susceptible to sun damage, and the skin becomes thinner. Too much polyunsaturated fat makes the skin age and become disorganized prematurely.

**Sharon Kleyne:** What about coconut water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a great source of minerals. If it is fresh, it has good sugar. Sugar oxidizes to produce carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide is the main power in regulating the alkalinity of cells. Orange juice is an ideal source of carbohydrate because it has minerals.

**Sharon Kleyne:** You are not anti-dairy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, because of the high calcium content and the low ratio of phosphate to calcium. Phosphate is an age-accelerating factor. A diet high in meat and nuts has a serious excess of phosphate and a deficiency of calcium. Calcium stimulates the metabolic rate and prevents obesity. People who drink milk regularly are a very slim population in proportion to the calories they consume.

## Eye Health and Structured Water

**Sharon Kleyne:** Tell us about your research regarding aging eyes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got interested in how the transparency of the cornea and lens works while in Mexico at Lake Pátzcuaro. The fish there were transparent; you could read a magazine cover right through them. This got me interested in what makes the tissue transparent.

The water molecules are lined up such that the quantum energy is organized. Mae-Wan Ho at the Institute of Science in Society writes about the "coherence" of organisms involving this quantum-level organization of water.

In the lens and cornea, if you have too much inflammation, estrogen, or ultraviolet radiation, it excites the tissue and lets the water get disorganized. The water content increases in a loose form, and that causes the opacity of a cataract. It is actually too much water because it is out of control and disorganized.

**Sharon Kleyne:** Is that because the proteins are dehydrating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the proteins are dehydrating. They are losing control of the water. The living substance has lost its structured water, and the bulk water is retained.

**Sharon Kleyne:** If the body is swelling, it is trying to hold back on its loss of water. With the carbohydrates and fats in food, the cells get toxic. I call it "manure" that heats up the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The "age pigment" (lipofuscin) is involved. It is what you see as spots on old people's skin. It starts anytime the tissue isn't getting enough oxygen to retain its water properly. Polyunsaturated fats become oxidized and form clumps of this dark pigment. This wastes oxygen and creates a vicious circle. Progesterone and thyroid can energize the cell enough to reverse that age pigment.

## Conclusion

**Sharon Kleyne:** We are out of time. What would you like to say to the audience worldwide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is so much on the internet. Look at websites for Vandana Shiva, Gerald Pollack, and Martin Chaplin, who has a great water website. You can get information that your doctor won't know for 100 years.

**Sharon Kleyne:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. This has been one of our most exciting educational shows. Remember, you are in the "Health Olympics." Earth is whispering to us every moment. Drink your water and think about your health.
