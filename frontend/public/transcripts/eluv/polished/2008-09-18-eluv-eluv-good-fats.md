## Introduction

**ELUV:** This is the Ultrasound Show and my name is ELUV. We're going to be speaking with Dr. Raymond Peat, who has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon. He specializes in physiology and has taught at several universities, including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine. He also conducts private nutritional counseling. We're going to be speaking with him about the benefits of good oils, with a focus on coconut oil.

Greetings and welcome to the Ultrasound Show. You've done some extensive research on nutrition, how oils affect the body, and the toxic effects of polyunsaturated fats. I wanted to start by defining: what is a good oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically, saturated fats are safe and even therapeutic. A man named Nanji, who has been working with liver diseases, has demonstrated some of the toxicities of the unsaturated fats in a very comprehensive way. He showed that coconut oil and other saturated fats can be used therapeutically to treat liver disease, hepatitis, and cirrhosis.

The liver happens to be his specialty, but people have demonstrated similar effects in all systems, including brain protective effects and preventing aging of the skin. There were some very old experiments where they shaved rabbits; the rabbits given unsaturated vegetable oil in their diet got aged, wrinkled skin when exposed to sunlight. The rabbits given coconut oil tolerated the sun exposure without aging effects.

**ELUV:** This really goes against what we have been taught here in the United States about saturated fats—that they were bad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the coconut industry doesn't have a good lobby in the United States.

## The History of Oil Consumption

**ELUV:** What is that all about? Because years ago, apparently, we used to use coconut oil for many of our food processes. What happened to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For 100 years, it was a good, cheap oil. They made crackers, tortilla chips, and potato chips with it. It was very popular because you could store it in a barrel as long as you wanted and it never got rancid.

But in the Second World War, the islands weren't accessible, so they started experimenting with using other seed oils. Animal food was one of the first places they experimented with unsaturated fats. They started seeing rats and other lab animals dying with softening of the brain and degeneration of the gonads. They found that it was one of the effects of getting too much of the polyunsaturated fats.

Mink farmers were another early experience. They were feeding the mink a lot of fish, and the mink were getting a specific disease of their fat tissues that would ultimately be fatal. It was called "yellow fat disease," and that was traced to the unsaturated fats in the fish.

Early Vitamin E studies showed that it would protect to a great extent against overexposure to unsaturated fats. That led to Vitamin E being thought of as an antioxidant. Originally, research showed Vitamin E was an anti-estrogen, but it came to be described only as an antioxidant because it protected against polyunsaturated fat excess. The reason there is a connection is that estrogen excess causes the oxidation of polyunsaturated fats. An excess of either estrogen or polyunsaturated fat amounts to the same thing as a Vitamin E deficiency, leading to sterility, brain problems, skin aging, and so on.

**ELUV:** Is Vitamin E a saturated oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E is somewhat unsaturated, but it happens to stop the chain reaction that proceeds if you have too much of the polyunsaturated fats. If you don't have any polyunsaturated fats in your diet, you really don't need Vitamin E. The requirement for Vitamin E is directly related to how much unsaturated fat you're eating. When they feed animals coconut oil, they find that they hardly need any Vitamin E at all. Coconut oil works very much like Vitamin E in stopping the chain reactions of oxidation.

## Fish Oil and Essential Fatty Acids

**ELUV:** Let's go back to fish oil. There is a huge industry move promoting fish oil as brain food. You're saying that's actually not true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I have several articles on my website describing the history of the concept of unsaturated fats being "essential" nutrients. That was revived around 1950, despite research that had knocked it out because they were proven *not* to be essential nutrients. You could cure the disease that had been called an "essential fatty acid deficiency" by giving Zinc and Vitamin B6. So, it wasn't a fat deficiency at all; it was a vitamin deficiency brought on by intensified metabolism.

When you don't eat the fats, you simply need better nutrition because your metabolism is running at 100% activity, the way it should. Following the discovery that polyunsaturated fats slow the metabolism—so you don't need as many vitamins and proteins—pig farmers found that very valuable. If they fed pigs a lot of polyunsaturated fat, strictly a corn and soybean diet, the pigs didn't eat as much because their metabolism was suppressed. They could fatten the pigs very cheaply. Since they sold the pigs young, it didn't matter that it also caused accelerated aging, cancer, and heart disease.

After it became an established part of the American diet, it had the same effect on people. It started making them obese, even though they weren't eating as many calories as previously, because it poisons the thyroid system. The thyroid makes you able to produce energy, use a lot of oxygen, and eat a lot of food without getting fat. Polyunsaturated fats block the function of the thyroid hormone at three or four separate points.

## Thyroid Function and Weight Loss

**ELUV:** This is interesting because people go to their doctor and are told they have a hypothyroid condition. They concentrate on that, whereas that is almost an effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Textbooks 60 years ago used to say that anyone could lose weight if they ate less than 1,700 calories a day. But women have been kept in closed wards where they could maintain their weight on 700 calories a day—less than half of what used to be maintenance. That is simply because the American metabolic rate has drastically slowed over the last 50 years.

The first time I experimented with coconut oil, I had been at about 186 pounds for 20 years. I started putting a tablespoon of coconut oil on my supper. I noticed right after eating that I felt like I had been exercising. I was pink and breathing hard for about two hours. I did that every day. Gradually, that leveled out, and I found I was losing a pound a week. By adding another 100 or 200 calories a day in the form of coconut oil, over a period of several weeks, I stabilized at a new weight of about 176 pounds.

**ELUV:** There have got to be people out there going, "He's eating oil and losing weight. Does this make sense?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years before, I read research with rats where they did the same study methodically. They divided rats into groups consisting of pure saturated fat (coconut oil) and the other extreme, pure corn oil. At the end of their lifetime, the obesity didn't correspond to the number of calories they had eaten, but only to the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat. The rats who had a low-calorie diet but pure corn oil were the most obese. It was strictly the ratio of fat, not the quantity.

## Animal Fats and Diet Choices

**ELUV:** Going back to livestock fed with these unsaturated fats—how does that affect us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have analyzed lard. Scientists used to think of it as a saturated fat, and it was when pigs ate well. But for the last 50 years, pig fat has been chemically the same as corn oil or soy oil because that's what they eat, and it gets stored in their tissues. When you eat pork from industrial pigs, you're basically having a high vegetable oil intake, which is extremely fattening.

Beef and lamb evolved to eat vegetable material. They evolved a stomach which specifically destroys polyunsaturated fat. They have enzymes which use Vitamin E to destroy about 98% of the vegetable oil in their food, turning it into saturated fat.

**ELUV:** That's fantastic to know for making diet choices.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's why milk, even whole milk, is not associated with obesity. I first noticed this on a trip to Russia, where everyone was fat. When I crossed the border into Finland, everyone had milk and cheese in their stores, and everyone was slender and healthy-looking. Research shows milk drinkers have a very low incidence of obesity.

**ELUV:** What if they're drinking low-fat milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's fine, but they need to keep the fats in proportion. If you eat beef, you're getting a large proportion of saturated fat. Even if you don't eat the fat part of the meat, the muscle tissue incorporates a pretty good percentage of saturated fat.

**ELUV:** Would that be the same for duck or pheasant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, those animals reflect exactly what they eat. They don't have the detoxifying system, so they are pretty unsaturated. However, they live at a very high body temperature. Poultry is not as bad as pork or rabbits because the higher the temperature of the organism, the more saturated the fat has to be. The extremely unsaturated fats oxidize and break down so fast that in a chicken or pheasant, they don't make it into the tissue the way they do in a colder animal.

**ELUV:** What about fish? If fish oil isn't good, is the fish itself okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have ever had a piece of fatty fish laying around at room temperature, it gets rancid very quickly—even worse than leaving corn oil out. That's because the fish evolved to live in cold water. At room temperature, it starts oxidizing.

Anyone can do a simple experiment: put a cork in a bottle of unsaturated vegetable oil with a small rubber tube leading into a glass of water. At room temperature, the oil acts like it's respiring. It burns oxygen, breaks down into a varnish-like material, and sucks water up the tube. Fish oil is even worse than standard seed oils. An Amazon river fish, where the water is warm, has fat very similar to olive oil and is much safer, but we rarely get those in the United States.

**ELUV:** What about fish from Florida, since it's warmer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Undoubtedly they are safer. Any organism reflects the temperature of the tissue; warmer tissue has more saturated fat. A biochemist put sweaters on pigs and found their fat became more saturated just by keeping their skin warmer.

**ELUV:** I was speaking with someone in Israel who gets organic olive oil from the mountains. Is that a good oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's one of the best oils we can get next to coconut oil, but it still has about 10% of the toxic polyunsaturated fat. You don't want to use more than just enough for flavoring.

## Coconut Oil Dosage and Estrogen

**ELUV:** Is there a particular quantity of coconut oil someone should consume daily?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually a tablespoon once or twice a day. That will intensify your metabolism and make you lose weight easier. I've known people who ate ounces a day to treat brain tumors or epilepsy, or to lose weight quickly, but too much can make you feel extremely hot.

**ELUV:** You mentioned it reduces estrogens. Is that through the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The thyroid activates the liver. Assuming there's enough protein and B vitamins in your diet, the liver should destroy 100% of the estrogen in the blood that passes through it. If your thyroid is low, the liver allows estrogen to pass through. This raises your systemic exposure to estrogen, which blocks the secretion of thyroid hormone. It starts a vicious cycle.

In the estrogen-stimulated state, the body selectively favors polyunsaturated fats. Women normally have a much higher concentration of polyunsaturated fats circulating because estrogen causes them to be released. Those fats then activate the estrogen receptor and intensify the effect of estrogen.

**ELUV:** Does this affect cellulite?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There's usually a lot of water in the tissue under the influence of estrogen because both estrogen and polyunsaturated fats cause cells to be more permeable. Water leaks out of capillaries easily. Even if you don't have a lot of fat, the estrogen specifically around the thighs intensifies leakiness, causing water accumulation.

**ELUV:** Why is it so difficult for women to get rid of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mostly because they keep their thyroid suppressed by the percentage of unsaturated fats in the diet. The gland is unable to break down stored thyroid hormone, the transport protein is competed against, and the action of the hormone in the tissues is blocked by polyunsaturated fats.

## Processing and Usage of Coconut Oil

**ELUV:** What is the best way to take coconut oil? Cold pressed, virgin, expeller pressed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For thousands of years in tropical climates, they filtered it to remove the debris produced when crushing the coconut. This was done because particles cause the oil to go rancid by liberating enzymes. The research on the benefits of coconut oil was done using the highly filtered, tasteless, pure product. It is the oil itself, not the nutrients in the natural product, that has the benefits.

**ELUV:** So it's not the actual pulp?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that is removed so the oil will be stable. The nutrients are there in the fresh oil—it's delicious for ice cream or cookies—but it doesn't keep well. For weight loss, anti-cancer, and liver-protecting effects, the plain, tasteless, filtered oil is fine.

**ELUV:** How long does it take to see benefits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can feel the effect usually in about 30 minutes after eating it; your pulse rate goes up and your hands get warmer. However, a complete change of body fat takes about four years. If you've had a very unsaturated diet, your thyroid is going to be suppressed for two or three years even after changing to saturated fats.

**ELUV:** If the thyroid is fast, does it help balance it out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually, when the thyroid is overactive—pulse over 100, temperature around 99, sweaty hands—that is a self-correcting process. After about six weeks, the thyroid has unloaded the excess. In the last 50 years, people are frightened by that heat and doctors kill the thyroid gland, but it really is a self-corrective process.

**ELUV:** So given the right fats, the body has the capability to regenerate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A researcher in Israel, Gershom Zajicek, calls it "the streaming organism." He cites evidence that all tissues—brain, eye, liver, adrenal glands—are constantly regenerating. All you need is energy to keep that regeneration going, and the thyroid provides that energy.

**ELUV:** How exactly does coconut oil help the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main value is that it interrupts the anti-thyroid effects. When you eat coconut oil, it gets into your bloodstream and relieves the suppression of metabolism by getting in front of the suppressive molecules. The short-chain saturated fats (6, 8, and 10 carbon molecules) are very active metabolically. They can be taken up by the mitochondria without using the carnitine transport system. It bypasses that system and gets metabolized immediately. It's like little kids crowding in line ahead of the big fat people.

**ELUV:** It sounds like it's acting more like a carbohydrate than a fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. It is as easily metabolized as a sugar molecule. Also, those short-chain saturated fats have a hormone-like effect. They have an antihistamine effect, quieting immune cells. When metabolized, they release ketones. These short fatty acids and ketones act like GABA transmitters in the brain to calm overexcited cells.

**ELUV:** That seems like an anti-stress effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The GABA system helps slow excess cell division in tumors. That's probably one of the reasons saturated fats are protective against tumors—it applies the brakes the way the GABA molecule would.

## Skin Care and Conclusion

**ELUV:** I use coconut oil for skin care.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The rabbit experiment showed it protected against skin aging and sunburn. If you are sunburned, you can apply coconut oil to get a protective antihistamine effect. The sun causes excitation that spreads to the polyunsaturated fats in skin cells. Saturated fats interrupt that spreading of destructive oxidation.

**ELUV:** Weren't there studies in Asia regarding skin and sun?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was consulting with a couple in San Diego—an older man and his attractive young Filipino wife. They had been married for 40 years. She cooked her meals in coconut oil and his in standard American food. She looked 30 or 40 years younger than him.
