## Introduction

**ELUV:** Tonight we have special guest Dr. Raymond Peat, who has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at several universities, including the University of Oregon, Montana State University, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and Blake College. He also conducts private nutritional counseling. Today we are speaking with him about the effects of stress and trauma on the body.

Let's dive in. Tonight's theme is really about how the body reacts to stress and trauma. Let's first talk about day-to-day stress and what happens to the body and the brain physiologically.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing is that if you're really healthy, you can meet challenges without experiencing something that Hans Selye would have called stress. For example, if you are not very healthy, just skipping a meal can put you in really serious stress. However, a healthy person stores something like 7 or 8 ounces of glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver, muscles, and brain. Since at rest the muscles can burn primarily fatty acids, your brain is the main thing that consumes glucose. If you are more or less inactive and relaxed, you can easily go 12 to 15 hours without eating and without having any stress at all.

But if you're not able to store that much glycogen—for example, low thyroid people or people with a history of severe stress aren't able to store very much—then when you run out of sugar, whether it's from going all day without eating or because your liver isn't very efficient, your body tries to increase the available glucose.

Normally, just being awake makes enough adrenaline to mobilize as much of the glucose from your stores as you need. But when you run out of that stored sugar, your brain still requires sugar to function properly. Instead of just increasing the adrenaline more and more, when the adrenaline reaches a certain level and can't get the blood sugar up out of your storage, then you turn on the cortisol. That's the classic stress that can be harmful because the cortisol dissolves tissues.

First, tissues like the thymus, which are very fragile, start turning to sugar immediately when you run out of stored glycogen. The thymus is gone in just two or three hours of intense stress. That happens to be one of the reasons they think adults don't have thymus glands; by the time they are dead and analyzed, the thymus has been eaten up by stress. They might have had a perfectly normal thymus until they were sick and dead.

After the thymus is consumed and turned to sugar, the cortisol starts breaking down your muscles. Then the skin, brain, lungs, and heart are spared from stress, partly because they are very saturated in a healthy person with androgens—testosterone and DHEA especially—which block the breakdown function of cortisol. If your brain, lungs, and heart are short of those protective steroids, then that's where the stress really starts causing severe, deadly damage.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is produced when someone has had such terrible stress, such as being tortured or being in terrific catastrophes. They not only deplete stored glycogen and break down the expendable tissues like thymus and liver, but then the cortisol starts damaging the brain and heart. They get very severe chronic symptoms. Once the stress is completely resolved, the brain can massively regenerate itself. For example, they've seen MRIs of girls who had been in anorexia for months; their brain shrinks from living on the cortisol breaking down their tissues, but once they start eating, the brain can rebuild itself in just a few weeks.

## Meal Frequency and Stress

**ELUV:** How often does one have to eat, or is it recommended to eat, in order to not have this stress reaction happen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The famous Argentine biologist Bernardo Houssay, in the 1940s, was the first one to show that if he fed his animals only once a day, they not only tended to get fat on the same amount of calories, but they had a high incidence of diabetes. But if you fed them at least three times a day or more, then they were very resistant to diabetes and were less fattened on a given number of calories. So, more or less nibbling all the time is the safest thing. But if you have a really good diet and aren't under emotional pressure, then a person can get along on one or two meals a day.

**ELUV:** Let's talk about a really good diet. What is a really good diet for the optimal health of the body, brain, and organs? There are a lot of disputes about optimal diets. Does it differ with different people, or is there an overall optimal diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blood type has almost no effect because you can see in even very different species of animals that have very different ways of living, the same processes occur. So there's a universal animal diet that is optimal, but the proportions vary with the type of activity, body size, metabolic rate, and personal history. Your previous stresses will affect what you need.

## Diet for the Stressed Metabolism

**ELUV:** Let's talk about someone who perhaps is not that healthy and does have stress. What would be the recommended diet for them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the reasons that the single-meal eaters tend to get fat and diabetic is that it triggers a great surge of insulin, and the insulin then triggers cortisol. If you can eat foods that don't trigger insulin, that's the ideal thing.

Fruit happens to be the best single type of food for not triggering the stress reaction because it combines very small amounts of protein with large amounts of sugar. The mineral potassium happens to handle sugar in place of insulin, and the fructose component of fruit sugar doesn't require insulin. So eating a lot of fruit, even in one meal a day, produces a much smaller amount of insulin, obesity, and cortisol than eating just one big meal of meat and potatoes. Meat powerfully stimulates insulin and cortisol, and starches are more stimulating to insulin than sugars.

**ELUV:** It's almost counterintuitive when you're talking about taking in fructose in the form of fruit with people that are insulin sensitive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, for about 100 years, fructose has been recognized as the ideal sugar for diabetics because they can metabolize it without needing insulin. It used to be sold in health food stores all across the country for diabetics.

## High Fructose Corn Syrup vs. Fruit Sugar

**ELUV:** Let's talk about high fructose corn syrup and the difference between that and fructose from fruit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The funny thing about that is that if you look at the fructose and glucose content, it seems to be not very different from any old sugar—maybe 45/55% rather than an exact 50/50 balance of fructose and glucose. But people actually thought to analyze what is in the stuff *other* than fructose and glucose. It turns out that the reason people get fat on soft drinks that contain it is that it contains a huge amount of calories that are neither glucose nor fructose. It's the syrupy component—basically a type of corn starch or corn syrup. They don't count it because it isn't fructose or glucose, but it's there as calories.

**ELUV:** Now they're using this in so many different things, from salad dressings to soft drinks.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was a trick. Because of the boycott of Cuban sugar starting in the 60s, the price of sugar went up because they wouldn't buy it from where it was cheap. So the corn starch producers learned how to produce something resembling sugar. It's really like the old Karo syrup, which was not a very appetizing way to sweeten things. During the Second World War, I think the Germans pioneered it, but in the United States sugar was scarce, and corn syrup started being used in canned things and even in homes as a substitute for sugar. But the sweeter, more palatable form that they call high fructose corn syrup was developed in the 60s in response to the increased price of sugar.

## Industrial Seed Oils

**ELUV:** It's amazing. They've done similar things with oils too, using oils that are quite toxic in our foods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cottonseed industry was a major power behind that. Way back in the end of the 1800s, with the gin to make cotton textiles more economical, they had machines to get the seeds out of the cotton. In proportion to the production of cotton, they were accumulating seeds that were too toxic to feed to animals. They found that they could squeeze oil out of the cottonseed, and by chemically hardening it, they could sell it as artificial butter.

For about 20 years, the butter industry required them to sell it in a colorless state, and the person had to add color so that it wouldn't ruin the butter industry. But the seed oil industry gradually got powerful enough to convince people that it's better than butter. In fact, it has many toxic effects that butter doesn't have.

**ELUV:** Is this the same as rapeseed oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first rapeseed oil happened to cause severe heart disease, and the industry wanted to sell it for margarine and cooking oil. There was a particular oil in that plant that they decided to blame the heart injury on. But Hans Selye did experiments studying the type of lesion in the heart produced by rapeseed oil. He found that it was the linoleic acid in it—which is still in it—that caused the damage. They took out the peculiar, unusual fatty acid, but the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, is heart-toxic.

Hans Selye showed that if you added cocoa butter—highly saturated stearic acid—to the rapeseed oil, it no longer caused death of the heart cells. So it's just the excess of polyunsaturated fat that made the rapeseed, canola, or cottonseed oil toxic. All of those are actually toxic if you eat very much of them.

**ELUV:** What about soybean oil? Because they're all GMO now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's still the polyunsaturated component. It turns into prostaglandins, which promote all kinds of inflammation and degenerative diseases. As early as 1964, a Dutch researcher named Böttcher sliced open the lesions in atherosclerotic arteries at all different stages of development and analyzed the fats in them. He called it a primitive idea that cholesterol got diffused out of the blood into the artery and damaged it. He said that the situation is very different from that. In the most advanced lesions—the farthest advanced atherosclerosis—he found that the content of linoleic acid was highest. After that, many other people demonstrated that the oxidation products of these unstable, highly unsaturated fats are found increasingly in atherosclerosis.

**ELUV:** It's very interesting that things like seed oils, canola oil, soybean oil, high fructose corn syrup, and butter substitutes are being advertised as better for your health. It's really about the consumers educating themselves.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have to think of some excuse for claiming that people should buy them because they don't taste good. So the idea is that if they are "essential" in some sense, then the more you eat, the better they are. But in fact, it's very questionable whether they're essential as a nutrient at all. Animals can live more or less indefinitely—you can grow cells forever in a dish—without any of those, which I think proves that they're not essential nutrients. The more you increase them in the diet, there's a direct relationship with the incidence of spontaneous cancer. That was first demonstrated in 1927 and over and over since, but the industry keeps publicizing them as health foods.

## Ruminants and Dairy

**ELUV:** There's been a big resurgence of grass-fed beef, for example.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Beyond fruits, in the ideal diet, the ruminants are able to detoxify the polyunsaturated fats in grains or grasses. It happens to be vitamin E in the grass which enables them to convert polyunsaturated linoleic acid into the trans fatty acids. There is one of the components of butter or beef fat that is being sold as a drug or a health food because it counteracts the toxic effects of the polyunsaturated fats: conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). You get some of that in beef, butter, cheese, and milk.

The high ratio of calcium to phosphate in butter and cheese comes from the fact that green leaves—if the cows are allowed to eat at least some hay and grass—contain a low amount of phosphate and a high amount of magnesium, calcium, and other safe minerals. Too much phosphate, which you would get on a grain-based and meat-based diet, becomes toxic when it isn't balanced by at least as much calcium and other minerals, including magnesium. So milk, fruit, and cheese give you the main nutrients. Then there are just the regionally deficient things such as iodine and selenium; if you eat some kind of seafood, then you're getting the basic things for anti-stress foods.

## Vegetables: Raw vs. Cooked

**ELUV:** For vegetarians, would you say that it's a little more difficult because they're not eating these products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you concentrate on well-cooked greens, the protein and mineral balance in cooked green leafy vegetables is essentially the same as in milk. It's just less concentrated because of the high cellulose diluting it. But you must cook away, wash away, or skim away the anti-nutrients. For example, too much spinach contains oxalic acid that tends to take the calcium out of your teeth. Some leafy vegetables have chemicals that block your stomach's digestive enzymes. But a variety of cooked greens will provide the same type of protein that milk provides, as well as the very favorable balance of magnesium, potassium, and calcium in relation to phosphate.

**ELUV:** Aside from spinach, what other vegetables would be better off cooked as opposed to raw? Do you advocate any raw foods or raw salads?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The very juicy fruits are best raw, but if they're starchy like bananas or plantains, they should be cooked by preference because the starches can enter the bloodstream and trigger allergic reactions. Too much undercooked starch causes "persorption." The particles enter the bloodstream and can block capillaries and arterioles, causing cells to die until the particle can be broken down. But it can stay in place long enough to kill cells in the heart, brain, and lungs.

Feeding mice on a very high raw starch diet, a biologist in Germany found that they were very prematurely aged because of the death of cells in all of their organs that were blocked by starch grains. So starch, like potatoes, is almost a perfect food if they're very well cooked because you want to break down the starch. The non-starch ingredients of a potato have almost a perfect balance of nutrients—B vitamins, essential amino acids, and carbohydrate in the right proportion. The only things lacking in a pure potato diet would be vitamin A and vitamin B12.

**ELUV:** Are you speaking about sweet potatoes or white potatoes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** White potatoes. Some white potatoes contain enough carotene that they could provide the requirement of vitamin A. But sweet potatoes often contain so much carotene that it interferes with digestion. Too much carotene has anti-hormonal effects that can slow down your production of thyroid hormones, progesterone, and adrenal hormones if it accumulates to the point that it's making your palms turn orange.

**ELUV:** Which it does with some people who are juicing carrots a lot.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I constantly warn people about that. There are good chemicals in the juice, but unless your thyroid is pretty active, it's going to accumulate the carotene because you convert carotene to vitamin A. If you have vitamin B12 in proportion to how active your thyroid hormone is, you are fine. But if you're getting more carotene than your vitamin B12 and thyroid can handle, then it turns off thyroid function. I experienced that myself about 40 years ago; eating so many carrots that I suppressed my thyroid.

However, if your thyroid is good, then having a whole carrot every day has some very important anti-stress functions. Yesterday I heard from a woman who said that she had started a daily carrot salad and had almost immediate relief from all of her premenstrual and digestive problems. We've measured the blood hormones in a few people after they started a daily whole carrot. It's the stimulating effect on the intestine. The fiber in the carrot isn't digestible. The excretion of bile into the liver carries all kinds of detoxified chemicals and hormones. If you have fiber in your intestine, these toxins that the liver has gotten rid of will be carried out, bound to the carrot fiber. Without enough fiber, they can be reabsorbed and recycled. So your estrogen tends to go up as the fiber in your diet goes down. That in turn turns off your thyroid and progesterone, causing all the symptoms of estrogen and cortisol excess. In just three or four days, we've seen the cortisol and estrogen level in the blood drop as the progesterone comes up just from eating a daily carrot.

## Monitoring Metabolism

**ELUV:** It's so interesting how the food that we eat influences everything about our body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of people, partly because of a bad industrialized diet, are now going around in a chronically stressed condition. It's sort of like learned helplessness or post-traumatic stress syndrome. The diet keeps people in a high cortisol, high estrogen state. Before you have to do any important work, you should make sure that your diet isn't creating the stress day by day.

You can check your thyroid function just by measuring your temperature and pulse rate when you wake up and then in the middle of the day. They should rise so that your pulse is maybe 80 per minute at rest, and your temperature should be around 98.6 at rest. In the morning, it's okay for them to be about 10% lower—pulse rate and maybe 97.8 degrees or so.

**ELUV:** This can also be influencing the fact that men are having hormone issues as well, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a man is on a very bad diet or is under stress or has an accident, the estrogen level rises sharply. In old age, with any of the degenerative diseases, men tend to have a sharp increase in estrogen.

**ELUV:** So they can avoid this or monitor this by their diet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And your temperature is the quickest way, because estrogen lowers your temperature. Thyroid, progesterone, and DHEA help to maintain a good, steady high metabolic rate, even at rest.

**ELUV:** So when people get cold when they're sitting there in front of their desk or at home, that may indicate that the hormones have changed and the thyroid is dropping.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And one of the tricks of the body is that increasing the adrenaline can compensate for hypothyroidism. Some people are hyper-alert, anxious, and have a high heart rate, even though their thyroid is really low. Their temperature can be held up and look normal, except that it's likely to be higher when you first wake up in the morning and then decrease when you eat something.

**ELUV:** So it switches.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because the nighttime is when you aren't eating and your adrenaline and cortisol rise. Those can tear down your tissues at such a rate that they keep your temperature up. Then when you eat something and lower the stress, you see that your metabolism is really not so high. When the adrenaline is very high, even though your oral temperature might seem normal, your hands and feet will be cold—maybe even the tip of your nose—because the body is directing the energy so that your brain, lungs, and heart aren't deprived or chilled. But your body can consider your hands and feet somewhat expendable and let them get very cold.

## Surgery, Stress, and Recovery

**ELUV:** If we up the stress levels—someone has a surgery, for example—there are more severe chemical changes. Some of the symptoms in post-surgery can include low energy, weight gain, hormonal changes, depression, and sleep disorders.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And even dementia. Lately, they've been measuring mental function after major surgery. For months, even years after major surgery, people's mental function is often slowed down. That's because of the chronic effect of cortisol, which slows nerve conduction. It protects some of your tissues from inflammation, but it progressively damages your immune system and your nervous system.

**ELUV:** What would be the best way for recovery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thing about surgery, as opposed to a car accident, is that you can prepare for it. Even standard medical sources are now saying that you should check thyroid function before you schedule someone for surgery, because a hypothyroid person doesn't do well. Their cortisol is already high.

Before Hans Selye made stress famous, an American surgeon named George Crile in Cleveland over 100 years ago was studying shock from surgery. Shock, as he understood it, came to be part of stress as Hans Selye interpreted it. For Selye, an excess of estrogen was enough to create the whole shock syndrome.

In 1908, the mortality rate from surgeries at Crile's hospital was 4.4%. After he devised a way to reduce stress, in five years of application, it had cut the mortality to 1.8%. His basic procedure was to convince the brain that nothing had happened. He called it "anoci-association," meaning getting the brain to not notice the noxious events. He found that histamine was released by morphine when it was used to control pain, and that histamine brought on all of these other stress hormone changes. So he added an antihistamine—an herbal drug called scopolamine—to go with the anesthesia. Then he used a local anesthetic as the skin was cut, so that he was not letting the brain receive any of those harmful signals.

But careless, quick surgery nowadays often is very rough. The patient wakes up with changes in the brain from that powerful noxious stimulation. If you can get the doctor to reduce the trauma of the surgery, that's a very important part of recovery.

Since the surgery turning on the stress hormones turns off the thyroid function, temperature tends to drop drastically during and following surgery. In proportion to how the temperature falls, the person's recovery is impaired. So everything that will keep your temperature up during and after surgery helps. Preparing with at least two weeks of adjusting thyroid so that you're not hypothyroid makes the recovery a lot faster.

A study in Mississippi found that if the emergency intensive care people checked the patient's vitamin D levels as they came in, they found that out of 278 cases, only three people had normal vitamin D. Some of them had as low as 8 or 10 nanograms per milliliter, where it should be 50 or 55. When he got the dietician to supplement vitamin D, the length of stay in intensive care was cut in half, survival increased, and the expenses saved the hospital more than half.

**ELUV:** You mentioned an herbal antihistamine earlier. What was that again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was scopolamine. That is sometimes available if a person is nauseated after surgery. That's a very safe anti-nausea drug which does several things. It helps to hold up the body temperature besides stopping the nausea.

**ELUV:** And what can people do as far as specific diet for post-surgery recovery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same foods that are generally good, but emphasizing the things that are lost specifically by high stress, which are protein, zinc, and some of the B vitamins. Foods like liver, oysters, and eggs, which are rich in the trace minerals and protein, are ideal as long as you're getting adequate carbohydrate and calcium. These happen to be high phosphate foods along with the protein, but they have the highest concentration of the healing minerals and vitamins.

## Pasteurization and Exercise

**ELUV:** I wanted to ask you a question relating to pasteurization. You mentioned that there are beneficial nutrients in milk. Does this get discounted once the milks or cheeses are pasteurized?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it's such a tiny amount. They pasteurize it now in something like three seconds at a high temperature and then drop it immediately. So there's very little oxidative damage done now by pasteurizing. It might lower the vitamin A content 3 or 4%, but since it's such a rich source of all these nutrients, no one is going to suffer deficiency if they're eating pasteurized milk and cheese.

**ELUV:** What's your feeling about exercise during that recovery time for people that have gone through surgery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is better just to regain flexibility and mobility in a gentle way, not to worry about muscle-building exercise. The time to think about that is before surgery. In one study of old people, they found that the fatter they were, the better their long-range survival was. In the six months following the surgery, the death rate was much higher in the lean, low body mass people.

It isn't just the fat that is a buffer against stress, but mainly the mass of the muscles. Exercises such as deep knee bends and mild weightlifting with dumbbells—just a few minutes a day of mild resistance exercise—can keep your muscles sound and relatively massive. Muscles are themselves a hormone source. They can produce testosterone instead of cortisol when you're doing these resistance exercises. So muscle building is protecting your heart and brain as well as building up the reserves of tissue that are part of your resistance against stress.

**ELUV:** You mentioned that cortisol damages the brain once the trauma has happened. Is that reversible over time if someone is following a protocol that would support their greater health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's probably just the same as following anorexia. Young women can have great and quick regrowth of the mass of the brain substance just by stopping the stress and starting to eat well. I think that would happen with old people who are partially demented by the stress of very serious surgery.

## Adrenal Health

**ELUV:** Lastly, I wanted to chat a little bit about adrenals, as many people these days seem to be suffering from low adrenals or adrenal fatigue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I mentioned that the muscles are an important source of steroid synthesis. Our biggest endocrine gland is our brain, and the brain stabilizes all of the organs. If your brain is experiencing stress, that shifts the adrenal function to cortisol rather than DHEA, progesterone, and the androgens. The adrenals shouldn't produce simply the stress-promoting hormones; they should be putting out some of the defensive, protective progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone as well. But when your broken brain gives them the super stress signals, then they will overact.

Hans Selye defined adrenal failure as when the adrenal gland begins bleeding and the cells die that make steroids. But the adrenal cortex is extremely able to regenerate, as fast as the thymus and thyroid gland. If you're well fed and if you stop the stress signals, it can regenerate.

What Selye was talking about was an acute stress causing immediate bleeding of your stomach and intestines. That's because of the high cortisol production. If you continue that too long without feeding some of the curative nutrients—sugars, zinc, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D—then the adrenal glands can't keep up the intense work and they start bleeding and tissue dies. Too much estrogen is one of the things that can contribute to overacting of the adrenal cortex. In animal experiments, we saw that just injecting a big dose of estrogen would cause adrenal enlargement in a moderate case, or bleeding and death in an extreme dose.

**ELUV:** Absolutely amazing how everything is so connected.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I should mention that cholesterol, thyroid, and vitamin A are the important things for keeping the adrenal cortex from getting stressed to death. Cholesterol is the raw material for making cortisol and the other stress-adaptive hormones. Without enough cholesterol, thyroid, and vitamin A, these cells are stimulated but can't work, so they just give up and atrophy.

**ELUV:** What sources of cholesterol would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good diet. Plenty of fruit and milk in the diet will allow your tissues, especially the liver and brain, to make as much cholesterol as they need.

**ELUV:** And speaking of liver, would you recommend for people to eat liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Except for the ratio of calcium to phosphate, the liver has the highest concentration of the anti-stress nutrients. So at least twice a month there should be a good meal of liver for stress resistance. Maybe once a week. Four ounces a week is a safe and effective amount.
