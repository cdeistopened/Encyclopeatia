## Introduction

**Jodelle:** Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodelle Show. I am super stoked because it's time for another mind-blowing episode with Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat and I decided to do listener questions today, so I can hardly wait to hear his responses to some really great questions that people put up on Facebook. Dr. Peat, I appreciate you because, once again, I'm so honored beyond words to have you with me. Thank you so much. Are you ready for this slew of questions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep, go ahead.

**Jodelle:** Great. We'll start with a person who wanted to remain anonymous. They asked: Can you give us your opinion on the current fitness trends and also what your daily exercise looks like?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, I never exercise. Well, once about every 10 years, I do some exercises just to see how things are working. But the idea of "exercise," I think, is not biologically sound. I think all of your activities should be intentional in some way—constructive, or at least pleasure-giving. The idea of exercise seems to be more fulfilling a duty or obligation rather than doing something just because it's fun or productive.

## Exercise vs. Meaningful Movement

**Jodelle:** That takes me a little further down my list to a similar question. This woman likes to run. She asked: If a woman would like to run on a regular basis for enjoyment, is that beneficial, and does she need to be more vigilant regarding PUFA intake and environmental estrogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a very pretty place to run—like the natives of northern Mexico who have canyons and interesting scenery to run through just to do their social visits and tend to their chores—running is part of their lives, but it's also meaningful in many ways. It isn't just running down the street to a certain point and coming back. The rote nature of it, the predictability and the sameness of it, I think is actually somewhat harmful to your nervous system.

**Jodelle:** So you're thinking more in terms of movement. People need to move their bodies, but not necessarily getting on a treadmill or an elliptical machine to hash out 45 minutes just because they feel like they should.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the mind has to move at least as much as the body. When you're on a treadmill or running down a certain track, your mind is not moving. Your body is moving, but your mind is in a rut. And being in a rut is biologically harmful from a stress standpoint.

**Jodelle:** Right. So if we don't enjoy the exercises we are trying to do to get in shape, they can actually be stress-inducing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And it deepens the rut. A habit of doing something that isn't pleasurable or meaningful deepens your tolerance for meaninglessness. You're at risk of sinking into routine behavior and a routine life.

**Jodelle:** I like that. We need to have meaning in everything we do.

## Dairy Allergy vs. Lactose Intolerance

**Jodelle:** The next question is: Could you please tell us the difference between a dairy allergy and lactose intolerance? What different symptoms would we expect, and what can we do if it is actually a dairy allergy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An allergy can be deadly. A mild allergy is just annoying; if it's on your tongue or mouth, it makes it burn and maybe swell up a little. If it's serious, it will make your membranes swell up to a hideous extent so that you can't move your tongue or swallow. If it's a real allergy, it can stop function and make it impossible to breathe, which is fatal.

Lactose intolerance is simply the inability to absorb and digest milk sugar. If you have a sugar in your intestine that can't be absorbed, it has a laxative effect and tends to run through you. Or, if you have the wrong kind of bacteria, the bacteria can convert it to gas. Gas is the most common symptom for lactose intolerance.

**Jodelle:** I've heard you mention before that if somebody has an intolerance, different nutritional approaches can help that individual develop a tolerance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. A deficiency of thyroid hormone creates various metabolic inefficiencies. Low production of digestive enzymes is typical, as is low stomach acid. The enzymes to digest lactose will be low when your thyroid hormone activity is low. So, low-thyroid people, as a rule, have some extent of lactose intolerance. Just fixing the thyroid function will improve their digestion of milk.

There were studies of people who were theoretically genetically unable to digest lactose because of their race. They tested these people by starting with half a glass or a quarter of a glass of milk every day. After a few weeks, they found that these genetically intolerant people were able to induce the enzyme. The enzyme is there in infancy; it's just a matter of keeping it active or re-inducing it as an adult by giving your intestine exposure to a daily amount of lactose.

**Jodelle:** So if someone had the ability to digest dairy since infancy but suddenly can't digest it in their older years, would the cause be low thyroid, low stomach acid, or a vitamin deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin deficiencies and thyroid deficiencies often go together. As your digestive system slows down from low thyroid, you will absorb poorly and be more likely to get a vitamin deficiency.

**Jodelle:** That's helpful. Hopefully, that listener can start to address their thyroid and replenish their ability to take in dairy. That actually happened to me; once I got my thyroid working after toxic mold exposure, I was able to do dairy again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known people who recovered from a variety of very different kinds of allergies or sensitivities. Aspirin sensitivity is another thing that is supposed to be genetic, but I have a friend who was thought to be aspirin intolerant for 55 years of his life, and now he takes aspirin every day.

## Teeth Grinding (Bruxism)

**Jodelle:** The next question is: What is the root cause of grinding of the teeth, or bruxism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Serotonin excess is one of the things that happens during the night, usually due to an irritation in the intestine. As your blood sugar goes down, your nerves and immune system become more irritable because of the falling energy supply. That irritability during the night—even though the food wasn't causing an allergic reaction during the daytime—makes you start sensing relatively toxic or irritating things in your intestine. That causes the intestine to increase its production of serotonin. Serotonin is closely connected with bruxism.

**Jodelle:** So someone would want to get their serotonin levels down to prevent that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually just looking at your diet and finding things that are not well digested. Green salads are the worst offenders. They never can be digested by a human being, so they feed whatever bacteria or fungus happens to be in your system. Then the fungus or bacteria will make toxins that irritate the intestine so that it overproduces things such as histamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide.

**Jodelle:** I can't tell you how many women say, "I have a green salad every day," and yet have digestive issues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We simply don't have enzymes to digest them. There were experiments with rats feeding them fresh raw vegetables versus the same vegetables that had been canned at very high temperature and pressure. Supposedly, nutrients are lost by high-temperature cooking, but because it breaks down the cellulose, it actually makes more nutrients available. The rats wasted away when fed fresh vegetables but thrived on the canned vegetables.

You can do an experiment: put a bit of green salad into a plastic bag and keep it at body temperature for two or three days—which would happen after you ate it. See what happens to the fresh green salad. It's usually a foul mess.

## Stress Reduction and Exercise for Women

**Jodelle:** Rachel asks: What does Dr. Peat feel are the better exercises, foods, and supplements for middle-aged women in regards to lowering chronic stress or cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you live in a woodsy, cold climate, cutting wood and stacking it in the summer months is a good, useful exercise that uses your muscles. In the winter, or if you don't have wood to cut, dumbbells are the closest thing to getting muscle use.

**Jodelle:** I love that. I went camping recently and learned how to chop wood. It was a great workout, fun, and a stress reliever.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With a good cross-cut saw, you can saw logs for the fireplace and get push-and-pull exercise on your arm muscles, like a very expensive exercise machine.

**Jodelle:** She also asked what supplements or nutrition you recommend for lowering chronic stress and cortisol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things that are easy to digest and that don't lower your blood sugar are the most powerful anti-stressors. Keeping the ratio of calcium to phosphate very high in your diet has a relaxing, anti-stress effect.

When your muscles are active and growing, they actually produce some testosterone. When they're under stress and not being used properly, they tend to convert cholesterol into cortisol and actually create the stress syndrome. The unused muscle is slightly toxic under some conditions, whereas the used muscle adds to your steroid protective hormones.

## Jicama

**Jodelle:** Since you have a history in Mexico, I wanted to ask about my favorite starchy vegetable, jicama. What are your thoughts on jicama for digestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've eaten a lot of it. I don't generally tolerate starches well—for example, cucumbers give me terrible gas and even cantaloupes are too gas-forming for me—but I never had trouble with jicama. I don't know what it is; it is starch, but it isn't famously gas-producing.

**Jodelle:** I noticed that too. I wonder if it's because it may be part of the tuber family, like a potato?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's in a very different family, but it probably has a different set of allergens and antigens.

## Calorie Restriction and Thyroid (T3 vs. T4)

**Jodelle:** Tina asks: Does Dr. Peat advise those coming from calorie-restricted eating and intermittent fasting protocols to slowly increase food intake and possibly count calories?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The important thing is to watch your temperature and pulse rate as indicators of how energetic your metabolism is. It's normal for your metabolic rate to go down during the night, but after breakfast, you should pop right up to a working temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit) and a pulse rate of more or less 80 or 85 beats per minute.

**Jodelle:** Her second question was: Should we take T4 with T3, or do you advise just taking T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The value of T3 in a free form is that if you're in a hurry to correct a problem, you can use a physiological replacement amount of T3, such as between 1 and 4 micrograms per hour. With a meal, where you're going to be absorbing food for two or three hours, 10 micrograms is a pretty physiological amount. You can see if that relieves your symptoms.

I've seen very serious symptoms disappear in as little as a minute after taking a 5 or 10 microgram dose of T3. Insomnia will very often disappear five minutes after chewing up a bit of T3. Pains, arthritic pains, or breast pains will disappear in 5 to 15 minutes. It is valuable for its essentially instantaneous repair functions, but it goes away almost as fast as it takes effect.

I was taking 25 micrograms in the morning all at once for a time. After doing that for a couple of weeks, at sunset, my heart would begin stopping every 10 seconds for two or three seconds at a time. Once it stopped so long that I started blacking out. I realized that taking an outsized dose all at once causes your liver to start eliminating the T3 at an exaggerated rate. After 12 hours of the liver excreting it at that high rate, if you don't replace it, you suddenly go into an extremely hypothyroid state, which leads to heart arrhythmia.

If you take T4 only, a very healthy person can handle it. They tested it in the 1940s on male medical students and said thyroxine (T4) had exactly the same effect as the full thyroid substance. But they didn't test it on women. It happens that estrogen affects the liver and the thyroid gland, blocking secretion of the hormone and slowing the metabolic process of the liver. It turns out that women have about five times the incidence of thyroid-related disease. Autoimmunity is closely connected to that feminine thyroid-estrogen interaction.

So, T4 is fine as a replacement for healthy people, but for people with a metabolic problem—mostly women—it's exactly the wrong thing to use. However, since you don't want to take 4 micrograms of T3 half a dozen times a day, taking T4 in the evening can help sustain things through the night. But it should be accompanied by, ideally, one or two doses of T3 during the daytime. The sustaining effect of T3 means that it activates your liver, keeping estrogen from accumulating. The active liver will then activate the thyroid gland, protecting it from the blocking effect of estrogen. Given the supporting effect of T3, a woman's liver can metabolize T4 just like a man's.

**Jodelle:** I have seen people take T3 and say that after a couple of weeks they no longer notice the difference. Is that because the liver is pushing it out and they need to up their dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, if you take 5, 10, or 20 micrograms at once, your liver is going to develop super excretory enzymes to lower it faster than normal.

**Jodelle:** And taking T3 sounds like a way to remove excess estrogens from the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and that will help you handle the T4.

## Aromatase Inhibitors

**Jodelle:** Diego asks: What do you think of anti-aromatase products like Exemestane (Aromasin)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those generally have fairly serious side effects. The steroid-based one is the least toxic of the aromatase inhibitors, but there are safe aromatase inhibitors. Aspirin and progesterone, for example, do a very good job.

## Weight Loss and Cold Extremities

**Jodelle:** Christy asks: I'm losing weight, but my hands and feet are cold even with natural thyroid medication, and I'm getting colder. Why is that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's important to check temperature and pulse rate as well as how you're feeling. If you have been reducing your intake of nutrients, you might have reduced some essential nutrient so much that you're in a stress state. High cortisol can make you lose weight under stress, but it will be primarily muscle weight.

Dieters used to go on very low-calorie diets or fasts and find they could lose 10 or 12 pounds quickly. Someone did a study analyzing this and found that on an extremely low-calorie diet, the weight loss was about 80% protein and only 15% or 20% fat. But if they took a moderate amount of nutrition—enough to reduce the stress hormones—they could lose 80% fat and only 15% or 20% protein tissue. It's essential to keep adequate nutrition while lowering calories. The adrenaline will come up and bring cortisol after, and the cortisol is what makes you lose muscle.

**Jodelle:** So she might try adding some more calories. If her adrenaline is high, would it serve her to add carbohydrates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. Carbohydrate at the right amount will spare the protein. If you are getting 80 grams of protein a day, getting carbohydrate from orange juice, for example, helps. It comes with minerals; potassium has a sparing effect on the protein besides the sugar. So fruit juice plus the adequate amount of protein will keep your metabolism up and tend to promote fat loss rather than protein loss.

**Jodelle:** That's a good tip. Anytime I drink orange juice, I feel warmer right after.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to allow time for the effect of the cold orange juice to wear off. If you drink warm orange juice, you'll see the warming effect immediately.

## Progesterone and Hysterectomy

**Jodelle:** The second part of Christy's question: She had her uterus removed. Her doctor told her she doesn't need to take progesterone if she doesn't have a uterus. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many doctors thought that was true 60 years ago, but I didn't know anyone still said that. It's a horrifying thing to think that a doctor still believes progesterone has use only to the uterus.

Progesterone is one of the most basic molecules in the universe. Starting right from the ovum itself, it is involved in the structure which organizes the genes and the cell division mechanism. As the organism matures, even before puberty, progesterone is in charge of brain development. If progesterone is low during gestation, the brain fails to develop. When it's given as a supplement in animal experiments, the brain becomes super-able, bigger, and more functional.

In the mature adult brain, progesterone is a major steroid—10 times higher in the brain than circulating in the blood. You might say the uterus is a very minor field of operation for the progesterone molecule. It governs brain growth and function. If it's low, a woman will experience epileptic seizures, mood depression, etc. A deficiency of progesterone affects every aspect of life.

## Sulfur Supplements (MSM)

**Jodelle:** Christy also asks: Are sulfur supplements good or bad, such as in the form of MSM?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When people email me that question, I send them a couple of articles from about 40 years ago. A woman in a California hospital was brought in, and she exploded in the operating room. She died, and several of the staff were injured. Analyzing the chemistry, the best hypothesis seems to be that she was using MSM to treat cancer in very large amounts. Some fluke in the way it metabolized led to that toxic explosion.

That only happened once, but I think it's good for people to be aware of that chemical analysis as an indicator of how little is known about the supplements people commonly use.

**Jodelle:** She literally exploded?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, or the gases around... they had opened a big incision and a surge of emissions occurred. I think it was described as an explosion, but the fumes quickly knocked out several of the staff.

**Jodelle:** Why do people take MSM?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they're doing it as an anti-inflammatory, there are lots of other anti-inflammatory things. The safest approach is to look at causes. Low blood sugar leads to inflammation. Too much unsaturated vegetable oil amplifies inflammation. Too much phosphate in the diet relative to calcium is a very powerful promoter of inflammation. Things that over-activate the parathyroid gland will lead to inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification—things these supplements are recommended for. Supplementing calcium and avoiding things over-rich in phosphates—like too much meat, beans, or nuts—is better.

## Colostrum and Powdered Milk

**Jodelle:** Trudy asks: What is Dr. Peat's stance on colostrum powder and powdered milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something I just ran across a few months ago was that the dehydrating and powder-producing industry has begun using nanoparticles to prevent clumping. Colostrum is a good idea, and powdered milk is a wonder food for convenience—I've used hundreds of pounds of it myself. But recently, I found this info on the new technology. Just so the powder will flow easily, they're coating it with nanoparticles.

I haven't found any industry source which admits they're using it, but you can find articles about the technology being sold. These nanoparticles, if they're in a particular size range, are carcinogenic and pro-inflammatory. So for several months, I haven't been recommending some of my favorite recipes, like powdered milk pancakes, because of the uncertainty of how these powders are being produced.

**Jodelle:** That happened with Vitamin C too, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in the mid-1950s. The research that made it famous was done in the 40s and early 50s. I used it myself; with two tiny tablets of 50 milligrams each, I ended a very intense poison oak allergy. But the next time I took it, the price had dropped by 90% and tablets were 500 milligrams. It caused cold symptoms and allergy symptoms when I took it. I started mentioning my experience to people with chronic sinus inflammation, runny nose, and hemorrhoids. A huge percentage of these people solved their problems when they stopped taking their synthetic Vitamin C supplements.

## Adrenal Tumors and Thyroid Connection

**Jodelle:** This is a loaded question: Can you ask Dr. Peat about pheochromocytoma, paragangliomas, and adrenal tumors? What can we do, and is there a connection to thyroid disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect that there is. The people I've known with that diagnosis were actually hypothyroid. In the absence of good thyroid function, the body looks for alternative ways to keep working. One way is to over-activate that particular kind of cell. It can go in different directions—excess serotonin or excess adrenergic chemicals. I think of it as the body inventing ways to get around an energy block.

For example, years ago they found that if you removed one ovary of an animal, the other ovary was likely to develop cancer because the pituitary gland was producing enough activating gonadotropin for two ovaries. It over-stimulated the remaining one.

There is good evidence that the same thing happens with the thyroid. When you're deficient in nutrients or have something blocking hormone production, your pituitary becomes hyperactive. TSH rises and chronically over-stimulates the thyroid gland, leading to cancer. Women are more susceptible because estrogen blocks the secretion of the hormone, making the pituitary work harder.

I think if you keep the pituitary under control so it isn't over-stimulating your adrenals, you reduce the risk. Once you get a tumor, it's too late to work on the pituitary level. But low thyroid leads to increased prolactin and TSH. Serotonin happens to drive all the pituitary hormones, so a stress that leaves you with chronic serotonin excess can contribute to all the tumor developments driven by the pituitary gland.

## Ephedra (Ma Huang)

**Jodelle:** John asks: What are your thoughts on the herbal form of ephedra, also known as Ma Huang?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've used it from the time I was four years old and first had migraine-like headaches. My grandmother made me Ma Huang tea—"Desert Tea" it was called. It's a powerful stimulant. Some people have used it in an excessive, chronic way for weight loss. In chronic excessive use, it contains things that are toxic to the liver. But if it's used just occasionally, for example, to treat nausea or a headache, it's fine.

**Jodelle:** Regarding weight loss, it stimulates the beta receptors, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but free fatty acids are the result, and free fatty acids are what make fat toxic. So it's better to eliminate the fat slowly and carefully rather than pushing it out with a stimulant.

## Cellulite

**Jodelle:** Ann asks: What is your remedy for cellulite?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The immediate thing is to check your temperature and metabolic rate. Look at your calorie and water consumption. You should be evaporating at least 2 liters of water every day that you can't account for. If you drink two quarts of orange juice and two quarts of milk, you should produce a moderate amount—maybe a quart—of urine per day. If most of your water intake appears as urine, you're not evaporating at a proper rate, meaning your metabolic rate is low.

Your temperature should be around 98.6°F during the day, and pulse rate preferably in the 80s. To do that might require supplementing extra calcium and making sure you're getting enough sodium. Having a Vitamin D blood test is a good idea; levels should be around 50 ng/mL. Vitamin D and thyroid work closely together.

If you still have a tendency toward cellulite, supplementing progesterone and DHEA—rubbing it into those areas and taking 5 or 10 milligrams orally—can activate the connective tissue metabolism to toughen up the tone of the tissue and help it get rid of the water.

## Conclusion

**Jodelle:** Last question: What is your favorite pastime?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think painting is my favorite thing. Whenever I can get someone to sit for me, I like to take portraits.

**Jodelle:** That's great. We have to get "Vitamin P" (Pleasure) as well as all these other vitamins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. It's really the key to the whole thing—to make it work pleasurably.

**Jodelle:** Dr. Peat, this has been so interesting. I really appreciate your time. Make sure you check out Dr. Peat's newsletter at raypeat.com or email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. Thank you once again, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you. Goodbye.
