## Introduction

**Jodelle:** Welcome to the Get Fit with Jodelle podcast. I am happy to have Dr. Ray Peat with me here today. Dr. Peat is my go-to source for all things nutrition and health. He has a PhD in biology and has taught at many renowned schools regarding nutrition and women's health. You can learn more about him by visiting raypeat.com.

Dr. Peat, I am honored to have you back. I wanted to pick your brain about digestion today. From what I understand, digestion is one of the top five reasons people come to see their doctor. Why do you think there is so much digestive distress in our modern society, and was it this bad 40 or 50 years ago?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One general problem is physical inactivity. People who live in apartments have to take their dogs out for a walk every day because the digestive system tends to slow down when you aren't walking. There are reflexes between the legs and the intestine. In general, physical inactivity affects the whole process of appetite, digestion, and elimination.

The change from a crude diet to a very refined diet was also a factor. Around the beginning of the 20th century, health organizations emphasized using whole grains rather than refined flour because of the bulk-forming effect of the bran. Studies comparing Africans and Americans found that because there was a lot of potato and fibrous foods in the African diet, their transit time was about 12 hours. The average American at the time had a transit time of 72 hours. That is a tremendous difference. The rising incidence of bowel cancer in America has been huge, whereas there is almost no colorectal cancer in the undeveloped parts of Africa where they still eat a fibrous diet.

## The Importance of Walking and Saliva

**Jodelle:** Do you think a lot of our digestive distress comes from a society of sitting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. Everyone who takes up the habit of walking for an hour or so a day notices improved digestion. The general sense of well-being is largely because of the improved movement of the intestinal muscles, but also improved secretions. Relaxing and moving around reduces nervous tension, which increases secretions. You can see it even in saliva. When you're very anxious, your mouth tends to go dry because the shift in the nervous system shuts off secretions starting in the mouth and affecting all the way down.

**Jodelle:** So there is a north-to-south process. Would you say saliva is just as important as stomach acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anyone who has taken a drug that shuts down saliva production has generally had an outbreak of cavities. Anticholinergic drugs and some antihistamines reduce the production of saliva so much that the chemical composition changes. Instead of washing away and inactivating bacteria, it tends to favor their growth. You see it in increased deposits on the teeth and the extremely fast development of cavities.

**Jodelle:** I didn't realize digestion translated to teeth health. I assumed you were going to say that lacking saliva leads to poor digestion because of the enzymatic breakdown in the mouth. Is that also the case?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a little digestion that begins in the mouth. 50 to 70 years ago, some people were fanatical about chewing food many times to liquefy it. However, the quantity of enzymes in saliva is not very great compared to some animals. Those same enzymes are secreted later in the stomach. If you miss getting some digestion started in your mouth, your stomach can make up for it by secreting starch breakdown enzymes.

## Stomach Acid and Bacterial Overgrowth

**Jodelle:** Let's talk about that north-to-south process. I've always been an advocate for adequate stomach acid. What are your thoughts on keeping it adequate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is regulated strongly by nerves and hormones. The ultimate source of the acidity is in oxidation and the production of carbon dioxide, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid. It is essentially a respiratory process. If your thyroid is very low, your stomach acid is going to be low. The muscles become weaker at the same time the secretions are weaker.

Slowing down the transit time allows abnormal yeast to develop in the stomach. Around 1955 or 1960, there were cases of people thought to be drunkards because they reeked of alcohol. It turned out they had a little brewery in their stomach. If they ate starch, their enzymes produced enough sugar for yeast to grow, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide.

When you look at the population, only a small percentage—maybe 10%—have a completely germ-free stomach and small intestine. A large proportion, 30% or 40%, have infections in the lower half of the small intestine. Another third has detectable germs all the way up to where the pancreatic enzymes enter. Slow transit and weak secretions allow organisms to survive. A very high proportion of the population suffers from microorganism overgrowth between the stomach and the beginning of the colon. When they grow only in the colon, they are pretty harmless.

## Liver Function, Gallbladder, and Endotoxins

**Jodelle:** I assume the liver and gallbladder are important here. I see many people with liver stagnation or who no longer have a gallbladder. How important is it to keep the liver functioning well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver absorbs nutrients, but along with nutrients come toxins. If you have bacteria growing where they shouldn't be, they produce toxins that burden your liver. One of the first things that goes wrong when digestion slows is that high endotoxin levels start slowing down liver function.

Fiber helps because it binds and moves along some of the bacteria, reducing the absorption of endotoxin. The liver also keeps hormone levels under control. It attaches sulfuric or glucuronic acid to hormones like estrogen to make them water-soluble for excretion. If you overload the liver, these hormones are excreted into the bile, reabsorbed, and give you a chronic excess of circulating estrogen. Fiber helps bind and move along the endotoxin, bacteria, and excreted hormones.

**Jodelle:** Can you explain endotoxin in layman's terms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its chemical name is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is a group of fatty acids attached to a carbohydrate that has a physical "soaping" action. The fat is absorbed in the cells and drags in this carbohydrate that acts as an irritant. Every tissue is damaged by endotoxin.

In the gallbladder, receiving chemicals like estrogen and endotoxin causes inflammation. If estrogen is high—such as in pregnancy—cholesterol tends to accumulate, forming sludge or stones. Thyroid deficiency is extremely closely associated with gallbladder problems because of the lowered detoxifying function of the liver. Estrogen can also cause spasms in the smooth muscles, starting with the gallbladder duct or the small intestine.

When you get into that over-excited, under-energized state, local irritation can send out waves of contraction that go backwards. This is reverse peristalsis. Embryologists experimented on medical students by putting microscopic particles—club moss spores—into their rectums in the afternoon. In the morning, they took swabs from their mouths. Those who regularly had morning breath found the spores in their saliva, showing it is extremely common to have reverse peristalsis all the way from the rectum to the mouth during the night.

## Symptoms of Endotoxin Poisoning

**Jodelle:** What are some digestive symptoms someone might experience if they have high levels of endotoxins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the intestine is in bad shape, the blood vessels in the intestinal wall become over-permeable—the so-called "leaky intestine." Toxins get into the general circulation and go straight to the brain, heart, and lungs. It can contribute to obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, shock-like symptoms, reduced heart function, heart failure, insomnia, and sleep apnea.

**Jodelle:** What about gas and bloating? Is that a clear-cut issue of endotoxins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you tap on your belly and it sounds like a drum, that is the accumulation of gas. When you are in a spastic state, the sphincters don't let it out. That pressure itself can cause migraines.

Walter Alvarez, a professor around 1910, inserted big wads of cotton into the rectums of medical students. Those susceptible to headaches developed one just from the pressure. He used this to argue against the concept of auto-toxicity, blaming it on pressure rather than the nature of the food.

**Jodelle:** Do you think anxiety has anything to do with endotoxin or gut distress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It goes both ways. Experiments feeding soluble fiber to rats found it increased fearfulness and aggression. Conversely, emotional experiences shift blood away from the digestive system to the muscles for the fight-or-flight reaction. The intestine suffers oxygen and sugar deprivation, leading to increased permeability and toxin absorption. This can cause chronic brain syndromes, mood changes, aggression, anxiety, and even contribute to epileptic seizures.

## Fiber, Probiotics, and Antibiotic Foods

**Jodelle:** Let's talk about the trend of prebiotics and probiotics. What do you think about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dr. Denis Burkitt showed Africans were free of bowel cancer because of fiber, specifically potatoes. Americans wasted cereal fiber to sell bran, starting the oat bran craze. However, oat bran breaks down into bowel carcinogens and estrogenic breakdown products. Clean cellulose fiber, like wheat bran, is practically resistant to bacterial breakdown, so it functions only as fiber to stimulate peristalsis and bind estrogen and endotoxin. The current prebiotic trend focuses on short-chain fatty acids like butyric and lactic acid, but these can contribute to systemic problems.

**Jodelle:** What about probiotics? I used to advocate for Bifidus bacteria, but now I don't advocate for probiotics because I don't understand the mechanism of adding bacteria when we are already in a world of bacteria.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The small intestine shouldn't have bacteria. Even if you eat yogurt-type bacteria, the stomach and pancreas secretions usually keep them from growing. You need something that produces a competitive antibiotic to compete against irritating bacteria.

In WWII, Germans in North Africa noticed indigenous people didn't suffer from dysentery because they ate small amounts of camel dung, which contained specific bacteria. These soil-based bacteria produce strong antibiotics. Unpasteurized cow's milk also contains these, making the milk resistant to bacterial growth.

**Jodelle:** Is our poo a marker of how our digestion is doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It should be basically the color and odor of a baby's. If it starts smelling rotten, usually you are feeling rotten. Getting that through you quickly is one of the functions of a good inert fiber.

**Jodelle:** What are some fiber foods you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Root vegetables typically contain intrinsic antibiotics to survive underground. If you put lettuce in a warm bag, it rots quickly. A carrot will remain unchanged, showing it has a powerful antibiotic system.

This led to the carrot salad idea. Shred the carrot finely lengthwise to maximize the surface area. This acts as a physical binding agent. If you eat it with olive or coconut oil and vinegar, you have three types of antibiotic substances in a pleasant salad. Doing that every day kept my intestine healthy for 20 years. Bamboo shoots (well-boiled) and well-cooked mushrooms are also good alternatives.

## Foods to Eliminate

**Jodelle:** What foods would someone want to eliminate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoid things that are hard to digest. All raw vegetables, except for carrots, are generally not good. Experiments showed rats thrived on canned, well-cooked vegetables but wasted away on raw ones.

**Jodelle:** Would eliminating gluten be another recommendation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Seeds contain proteins in a storage form. These storage proteins concentrate ammonia and potential irritants like arginine. When digested, arginine can feed the increase of nitric oxide associated with an irritated intestine. Legumes and cereals have low-quality protein compared to milk (70%), egg yolk (100%), or potatoes (higher than 100% because they recycle waste nitrogen).

## Lifestyle Advice

**Jodelle:** What other advice would you give for someone looking to improve their digestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoid eating while working or anxious. Pavlov showed that the setting in which you eat is crucial; unexpected stress can delay digestion significantly. Keep nutrients in balance—milk is designed to facilitate digestion. Mood is very powerful.
