## Introduction

**Jodelle:** Welcome to the Get Fit with Jodelle show. I am Jodelle, and Dr. Peat has honored us with his presence on the podcast yet again. It’s a treat, Dr. Peat. Thank you. What is new in your world currently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been writing a newsletter on vaccinations—sort of the history of vaccination and explaining some of the physiological points that are being misrepresented.

**Jodelle:** I am so excited to read that. For those of you listening who haven't signed up for his newsletter, it will blow your hair back when you read it. I highly encourage you to sign up as a way to show your support for Dr. Peat. You can send an email to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. If you are new to the podcast, you can read a plethora of research-based articles that Dr. Peat has written at RayPeat.com.

We had such a good podcast last time where people got to write in and ask questions, so we decided to do that again. The first question comes from Reba. She asks: How can someone get rid of endotoxins in the body since we know how detrimental they are?

## Endotoxins and the Carrot Salad

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A fiber diet, such as a raw carrot, is effective. If you shred a carrot fairly fine and add olive oil, vinegar, and salt, it is a pleasant enough food that you can eat every day. The carrot contains germicidal but harmless substances. Root vegetables growing underground have to resist mold and bacteria attacks, and that material has the same disinfectant effect in the intestine. Olive oil and vinegar also have a germicidal effect.

So, the salad is a good, protective, daily stimulating food. The bulk stimulates the intestine, generally reducing transit time. According to one survey, the average American had a three-day transit time, while the average person in Africa had less than a one-day transit time.

If you can get your intestinal activity increased, that has benefits far beyond reducing endotoxin. Your liver is constantly processing toxins and hormones. Estrogen, especially, is instantly inactivated when it reaches the liver. Some of it goes into the bile, and some is eliminated through the kidneys. However, if you don't have enough fiber in your intestine, the estrogen in the bile can be reabsorbed and return to the liver. When the liver is exposed to too much estrogen, it slows down and loses its ability to detoxify estrogen. Having a good flow of fiber through your intestine not only suppresses the endotoxin, but it binds the bile and the estrogen content of the bile, preventing its reabsorption.

**Jodelle:** So any kind of fiber has that anti-estrogen effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but raw carrot is a very safe one.

**Jodelle:** When you said salad, you are talking about the raw carrot salad, not necessarily a dark leafy green salad, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I did an experiment putting lettuce in a closed plastic bag to imitate the intestine's absence of oxygen and kept it at about 90 degrees. After two or three days, the lettuce was horribly rotten, supported terrible bacterial growth, and was foul-smelling. Since we don't have enzymes to break down cellulose, that same kind of process happens when you eat raw leafy material such as lettuce.

**Jodelle:** So stick to just the raw carrot salad if you really want to remove those endotoxins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can get fairly safe fibers in other ways. For example, well-cooked oat bran is a functional alternative, although research in Australia found that chronic use of oat bran itself has some estrogenic and carcinogenic effects on the intestine.

**Jodelle:** What about coconut flour? That is high in fiber.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In studies on pigs, it didn't work so well. It supports either bacterial or fungal growth.

**Jodelle:** That's interesting since most other coconut products we can trust because they help mitigate fungus and yeast in the colon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the coconut oil, if it is well refined and clean, is a good antifungal.

## Bone Broth and Bone Density

**Jodelle:** Reba also asks: What do you think about bone broth, specifically chicken broth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is one of my favorites. Backs, necks, wings, and feet are all high in collagen. If you cook them thoroughly, let it stand, and skim off the fat, that is very good, high-gelatin food.

**Jodelle:** I've done the wings and the neck. I've never done the feet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to be careful getting them from a farmer that you know. A big processor is likely to have processed the chickens with antiseptics, and sometimes the feet soak up a lot of the antiseptic.

**Jodelle:** Ben asks: Do we need to do regular weight training for bone density, or is there something else we can do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The diet really is the main thing. Keeping your stress levels low and your activity comfortable is key; it doesn't have to be anything special. Stress involves several things that interfere with bone repair and renewal. Even a deficiency of salt can create stress that harms the bone. Old people have been told to keep their salt down for blood pressure control, but that adds to their stress, increases adrenaline, and brings up the parathyroid hormone, which tears down the bone.

Keeping a very high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your diet is helpful because that helps to suppress the parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone blocks the use of oxygen in all of your tissues, leading to the production of lactic acid in the bone, which dissolves the bone and contributes to osteoporosis. That same bone-destroying effect lowers the energy production in all of our cells. Therefore, high calcium intake increases our metabolic rate and efficient oxidative metabolism all through the body, not just the bone.

**Jodelle:** Would you also say that being outside in the sun helps with bone density?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, for the Vitamin D. The older a person is, the less cholesterol the skin contains, and it is the ultraviolet light interacting with the cholesterol that makes Vitamin D. A person over the age of 50, especially a dark-skinned person, needs a lot more exposure to sunlight to get their Vitamin D level up adequately.

**Jodelle:** I like how last time you mentioned chopping wood is actually a really great form of exercise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is something that feels productive and isn't stress-inducing just by boredom. You can see the product of your labor, and that is anti-stress.

## Insulin Resistance and Keto

**Jodelle:** Sergey asks: How would Dr. Peat recommend dealing with insulin resistance and early type 2 diabetes? Should one be afraid of elevated blood glucose after saying goodbye to low carb or keto?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The chronic stress that elevates the free fatty acids in the blood is the issue. Women in particular have the problem of chronically high free fatty acids because estrogen causes a great activation of the growth hormone, which is a major producer of free fatty acids. It is free fatty acids in general, and especially unsaturated free fatty acids, that interfere with the use of glucose.

Keeping your fat intake low is somewhat helpful, but anything that lowers stress and lowers estrogen is going to increase your insulin sensitivity and your ability to use glucose. Everything that lowers stress tends to lower estrogen and improve your ability to use oxygen productively, converting sugar to carbon dioxide. When you are stressed, have high estrogen, or have too much free fatty acid in the blood, any sugar that is present tends to produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. Lactic acid itself has many toxic, degenerative effects.

**Jodelle:** I've heard a lot of people who went keto for a vast amount of time are now saying they have insulin resistance. It sounds like the stress of going into ketosis is part of the problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ketogenic diet is always stress-promoting, and that means it is diabetogenic to some extent. It isn't strictly generating ketones; hydroxybutyrate is included as a ketone, but it is actually an alcohol, not a ketone. Studies looking at the difference between actual ketosis and the presence of a high proportion of hydroxybutyrate show that hydroxybutyrate stimulates cancer growth and other stress-related things. If you had an artificial source of real ketones, that would probably be beneficial. But when you generate them yourself, you are under stress and creating a cancer-promoting, degenerative situation.

**Jodelle:** I am picking up a trend: stress is the main cause. What is your favorite way to de-stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Playing a musical instrument, painting, or just doing anything interesting. If there is wood to chop, that's a good activity. The culture is designed pretty much to keep people under maximum stress—sort of like "idle hands are likely to get in trouble." The economy is designed to keep everyone under maximum stress so that they don't get in trouble, but naturally, it doesn't work that way.

## Adrenal Insufficiency and Cortisol

**Jodelle:** An anonymous listener writes regarding adrenal insufficiency: "All I hear is that cortisol is evil and must be reduced. But isn't a certain amount necessary? Can you address those who have low cortisol?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Out of thousands of people whose blood tests I've seen, I have only seen one or two that were actually deficient in cortisol. Hundreds were diagnosed as having an adrenal deficiency, but their blood tests showed they were doing fine on cortisol.

The adrenals use cholesterol to turn into pregnenolone, and then into DHEA, progesterone, cortisol, and aldosterone. Cortisol and aldosterone are increased by almost any stress. Only a very small fraction of your pregnenolone, cholesterol, or progesterone makes it into cortisol. So, there has to be a great deficiency of cholesterol, pregnenolone, and progesterone before you experience an actual deficiency of cortisol. By the time you reach a real deficiency of cortisol, you are experiencing a whole range of symptoms and problems from low pregnenolone and low progesterone. You can tolerate lots of stress-induced cortisol if it is backed up with plenty of pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA.

**Jodelle:** Would that be something they would want to look into supplementing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In experiments on rats 60 years ago, they looked at the hormone levels of rats under stress. Some had higher than average cortisol. They gave them a gigantic dose of pregnenolone—equivalent to a cup full of powder for a person. There were no changes in their steroid hormones except for the ones who were under stress to start with; it brought their cortisol down to normal.

You can't "push upstream" in the adrenals. The more pregnenolone or progesterone you take, the more normal you become. It is the endpoint hormones—like aldosterone, estrogen, and cortisol—that are produced normally only in extreme situations to deal with specific problems. If you supplement those beyond what the body would be making, then you have potential problems.

**Jodelle:** So supplementing pregnenolone might be an easy fix rather than cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There was a well-known book about 20 or 30 years ago on the natural use of hydrocortisone (cortisol). The data he based it on showed that a tiny supplement, like 5 or 10 micrograms, could improve a woman's menstrual cycle. However, I happen to know some of his patients who were given what he called a "physiological dose" of natural cortisol—about 20 milligrams per day, which is what the body normally makes. After two or three months, they all started getting puffy faces—typical Cushing's disease symptoms. Supplementing that can be risky.

## Immune System Support

**Jodelle:** Leanne asks: What is a good strategy to help with my immune system? I recently found out I have Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus expressed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably the majority of people have those viruses. It is a matter of keeping them from expressing themselves and keeping your ability to handle stress optimized.

When you look at studies of general infections—measles, mumps, and so on—if you supplement Vitamin A and Vitamin D alone, those two are just about as effective as a huge vaccination campaign. The viruses that are resident in the majority of people aren't doing any harm if the immune system is okay. However, if you are overweight, your blood level might show a normal amount of Vitamin A and D, but your tissues can be very deficient.

A person will benefit from bringing their Vitamin D and A levels up. With Vitamin D, a serum level of 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter corresponds to a low rate of diabetes and various infections. Flu infections practically disappear when a person keeps their blood level at least at 50 nanograms per milliliter.

**Jodelle:** I was recently in Hawaii and noticed they don't have a cold and flu season. I wonder if that is because they get Vitamin D every day from ample sun.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known several people who used to have maybe five episodes of colds or flu every fall and winter. When they started taking Vitamin D, they didn't have another episode for several years.

**Jodelle:** What do you think about colostrum?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That probably is helpful in an emergency situation, but I don't think you need it. Magnesium is another nutrient that many people are deficient in. If your diet has too much phosphate, you can't get enough calcium and magnesium to balance it. If your thyroid is low, your cells don't retain magnesium. Magnesium deficiency opens up your immune system to flare-ups of these endangered viruses like Herpes and Epstein-Barr.

**Jodelle:** What about monolaurin, derived from lauric acid in coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The guy who was popularizing that asked me to join the campaign to promote it. I asked him if there had been any safety studies, and he got huffy and said I was anti-scientific. I've looked for safety studies, and I'm not convinced. Any of the lipid things that are germicidal can also be disturbing to our digestive system.

When we eat a fat like butter or coconut oil, it is in the triglyceride form. Our digestive system is equipped to handle that; it breaks the particles up into tiny chylomicrons which pass into the lymphatic system. Chylomicrons are formed only when you have the right amount of the right type of triglycerides. If you put other emulsifying things or very abnormal lipids in, it can disrupt our ability to make chylomicrons. Since chylomicrons are the major pathway for absorbing Vitamins A, K, D, and E, if you disturb them for too long, you can become deficient in the fatty vitamins.

## Kidney Health

**Jodelle:** An anonymous listener asks: With kidney issues such as frequent urination and dumping minerals, what do you suggest to calm down the kidneys?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The two hormones most protective for the kidneys are progesterone and thyroid. The vitamins I mentioned, especially Vitamin D, are extremely protective. Making sure you get the essential minerals—sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium—in a generous amount every day is protective.

Drinking too much water rather than milk or juices can wash the minerals out of you. It fills up your stomach and satisfies thirst, but it doesn't provide nutrients. It is better to only drink water when you are thirsty. Milk, juice, and coffee are accompanied by essential nutrients.

**Jodelle:** Are you a fan of coconut water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you open up a fresh green coconut, it is very nice. But I don't trust any of it commercially sold because I've seen some containing preservatives.

## Aspirin and Inflammation

**Jodelle:** Allison asks: Can white willow bark be taken instead of aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It works for some people, but it does have other ingredients. The tannin-type substance in any herb can be irritating to the intestine. It is a personal matter whether it works for you.

**Jodelle:** Can you tell people about the benefits of aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has many functions, but the thing that has been studied most is blocking the production of prostaglandins. Any inflammation tends to trigger the formation of these short-acting hormones. Most of them are simply amplifiers of inflammation. They are produced in the brain, heart, and other tissues in response to a minor trigger.

They are produced in proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) incorporated into these tissues. As we age, we very efficiently keep adding polyunsaturated fatty acids into our tissue structures. From age 20 to 40, we are probably doubling the amount of PUFA in our tissues. PUFA is what converts to prostaglandins in the event of inflammation.

A fetus or newborn heals an injury without scars. But as the PUFA in our tissue accumulates, wounds heal more slowly, cause more inflammation, and leave scars. Whenever you have systemic inflammation producing lactic acid and prostaglandins, both increase the deposition of collagen. With aging, the body approaches something like a big scar with very high collagen content. Aspirin, by blocking prostaglandins and several other inflammatory mechanisms, is important protection from inflammation and aging.

**Jodelle:** It also helps to lower excess cortisol, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it lowers the pituitary ACTH production. ACTH also brings up the adrenal aldosterone, which contributes to collagen production and deterioration. So, it protects against not just cortisol, but a whole range of degenerative processes.

## Fish Oil

**Jodelle:** Nick asks: I've been taking cod liver oil pills for Vitamin A and D. He says in a previous interview you said to avoid fish oils. Does that include cod liver oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cod liver oil is at least giving you A and D, which is beneficial if you don't have another source. But I think it is good to use a fish oil-derived Vitamin A and D where most of the other fish oils have been removed.

Studies on the fate of ingested fish oil are interesting. I did experiments with a bottle of unsaturated oils; I put a rubber tube in the bottle and the other end in water. Every day the water climbed up the tube because of the oxygen consumption of the unsaturated fat. Fish oils are extremely quick to react with oxygen. In studies, they found that before they reached the bloodstream, the majority of them had been oxidized.

With aging, the brain accumulates these oxidizable fatty acids, and the oxidation continues in the brain. "Neuroprostane" is what they call the breakdown product when it happens in the brain. The neuroprostanes are made from the type of fatty acid that predominates in fish oil. Before they reach storage, a large part of these fish oils are already oxidized and are immunosuppressive. That toxic effect on the immune system can temporarily reduce inflammation by damaging the cells that would react to harm. So, for about six months they are anti-inflammatory, but after that, the immune deficiencies start showing up.

**Jodelle:** I was never comfortable promoting fish oils because of the processing required.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Historically, it made very good varnish because it oxidizes so thoroughly. If you imagine that happening in your body, you don't want varnished blood vessels.

## Veganism and Hormones

**Jodelle:** Victoria asks: Can women who are vegans or vegetarians successfully follow Dr. Peat's nutritional guidelines and maintain a healthy menstrual cycle?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It happens that the only non-animal proteins that are really adequate for human needs are potatoes and mushrooms. You can thrive as far as protein goes with either. Mushrooms generally have more trace minerals than potatoes. You can get iron from mushrooms and all other nutrients except B12 and Vitamin A from potatoes.

Adequate bacteria in the intestine will make Vitamin B12. Vitamin A is the main problem. You need carotene, good thyroid function, and Vitamin B12 to convert carotene into the actual Vitamin A needed for making progesterone. The problem becomes that so many vegetables block your thyroid function. As long as you can keep your thyroid function up and have Vitamin B12, you can convert carotene adequately to Vitamin A to make your hormones.

**Jodelle:** Are there foods that naturally promote more progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The only things that provide energy—sodium, calcium, and sugar—are necessary for making the thyroid hormone that you need to make progesterone. But there are no foods that directly go to the progesterone system.

**Jodelle:** I wasn't convinced of the yam thing being a promoter of progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People were trying to sell yams as a progesterone promoter, but the crude sterol in yams is actually estrogenic and very toxic. Russell Marker, who developed the production of progesterone from yams, decided to try the raw yam powder. The next morning he said he looked like he'd been run over by a truck; he was all black and blue. He had broken so many blood vessels that he was bleeding internally.

## Stevia and Recipes

**Jodelle:** Elisa asks: What does Dr. Peat think of stevia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is very sweet, but I'm not sure it is safe. In a pinch, it can lower blood pressure, but I don't think there is any real problem with hypertension if you are eating well and keeping your thyroid function alright. Hypothyroidism is almost always behind hypertension.

**Jodelle:** I remember reading studies linked to infertility with stevia. Finally, do you have a favorite quick and easy recipe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I make a lot of custards. When I was confident there were safe sources of powdered milk, I had a recipe for pancakes with nothing but egg and powdered milk fried in butter. But you have to be sure your powdered milk doesn't have an anti-caking agent.

I am experimenting with recipes using Masa—nixtamalized corn. That is a very safe and digestible way to use a cereal. The processing in lime eliminates most of the toxins and breaks down the protein and starch.

**Jodelle:** How do you do your custard?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla.

**Jodelle:** That sounds easy enough. Dr. Peat, thank you once again for your time and sharing your vast knowledge. We appreciate you.
