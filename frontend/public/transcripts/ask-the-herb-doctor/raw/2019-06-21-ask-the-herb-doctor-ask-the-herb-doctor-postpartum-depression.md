**Speaker A** (00:00): Well, here we are again, June 21, 2019, another solstice. I think for some reason probably the third Friday of the month helps, but seem to have been on quite a few solstice Fridays in the last 14 or 15 years. So anyway, yeah, happy solstice to all you out there. Longest day of the year and things are getting warmer and warmer, even though the days are going to get shorter and shorter from here on in. And hopefully the imminent threat of war with the Middle east is not going to materialize anytime in the foreseeable future, folks, so we can enjoy our lives and raise our children and try and live in peace. All right. So this is ask your herb doctor. The third Friday of every month from 7 till 8pm this show runs is a live show, folks. And so from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00', clock, you are invited welcome to call in hopefully with questions related to this month's topic or a random list loose topic around postpartum depression, steroid hormones, new drugs with dangerous consequences, and all the other fun stuff that we bring up to light. And as always, Dr. Pete is going to bring his science based wisdom to bear in on these subjects. So from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00', clock, you're invited to call in the questions either related or unrelated to that subject matter that I spoke of. And then, yeah, we're always, we're always very pleased to get people from all over the world. It's kind of a fun thing when people call in from Australia or they call in from, you know, somewhere in England or wherever. Anyway, the number here if you'd like to call in from 7:30 on to pose any questions you have to Dr. Pete or myself, the number is area code 707-923-3911. And I can be reached at the end of the show or through business hours Monday through Friday or anytime on the web either at the 888 number, which is WBMurb, so 1-888-wBMIRB or you can email me andrewesternbotanicalmedicine.com so once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Pete on the radio show. Are you there, Dr. Pete?

**Speaker B** (02:14): Yes.

**Speaker A** (02:15): Okay. Thanks so much for giving your time as you've you've done for many years now on this show and we really do appreciate it. Okay, so your latest newsletter on postpartum depression, brain aging and reductionism continues along those lines and topics of the ongoing reductionism in science and how shortsighted that science is and linked to aging and the disease that some of these drugs are now causing that we'll get into later on with the obesity and Alzheimer's and diabetes epidemic. So for those people perhaps who've never listened to the show before or maybe even haven't heard your name, would you just outline your scientific and academic background for us before we start?

**Speaker B** (03:04): After teaching a variety of subjects, including linguistics and literature, I decided to go to graduate school in biology and got my PhD in 1972 and have been continuing to study mostly physiology and stress and aging since then.

**Speaker A** (03:29): Okay. And if people aren't aware of. Also, you've spent a long time and you still do spend a lot of time emailing people about health related issues and that's pretty much what you've been working on for the last 40 years or so since you graduated. Yeah. Okay, good. So after looking at your newsletter and formulating some questions for you based on it, just wanted to get a little bit of your inside thought processes here. When you've claimed or made the statements that you make, I think it's hard for sometimes for people to understand the things that you say because it sometimes seems so counter. Well, not sometimes, but quite often it's fairly counter intuitive to all the brainwashing that we get daily from books, magazines, TV adverts, et cetera. And as the world becomes more homogenous and the Internet links people more fluidly into this kind of cohesive organism. As you've always said. You know, William Blake's quoted that a lie travels around the world quicker than truth can get her bootstraps on. But I wanted to just talk briefly about the product that has just been given FDA approval this month, called Zulresso, also known as Brexanolone or also known as allopregnanolone, which we've mentioned in the past. It's a naturally occurring metabolite of naturally produced progesterone, but it's been used and given approval as an injection given over a 60 hour infusion in hospital to treat postpartum depression and it costs $34,000. Okay, so why not simply use a $30 bottle of progesterone or pregnenolone, both of which quickly convert in the body to allopregnalone and don't require extortionate hospitalization and drug costs, Further skyrocketing health insurance costs and drug manufacturer profits. What's your take on the reason that this drug has been given? I guess firstly FDA approval for this condition, which I'd like you to outline and I'm sure you will, as the questions go on here. In terms of the treatment of postpartum depression or why it occurs in the first place, because I know you definitely have your own opinions for that, but why allopregnanol and then allopregnanolone and then why an infusion? And now they're patenting. Previously what would have been classed as a natural product that women naturally produce and is naturally converted to this substance. This is a byproduct of metabolism.

**Speaker B** (06:14): If it was a natural therapy, it would be cheap and not patented and no one would make or hope to make several billion dollars a year from selling it. For the last 10 or 15 years, the FDA has acted as though it's in the business of creating monopolies. They did it with the sedative or semianaesthetic drug Oxybate several years ago and went from costing a few dollars for a bottle of it to thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.

**Speaker A** (06:56): Because it's been patented and the company's been allowed to use this as their standard and it's been protected.

**Speaker B** (07:01): Yeah. And after that they, they declared that quinine was a new drug and assigned a new drug approval to one company. And since they depend on fees to approve the drugs, a large part of their existence sees the money coming in from the drug as sustaining their existence. And if a doctor, for example, wants to use quinine bark or a natural nutritional substance for a therapy and it happens to compete with one of these new drug assignments, it's in effect the doctors attempting to break a monopoly. And in some situations doctors are actually losing their licenses for using traditional medical reasoning and avoiding the so called evidence based medicine.

**Speaker A** (08:26): Right. Which has become very popular, as a phrase, has become very popular over the last few years. I never heard of that up until probably 2014 or so, when studies would say the evidence based medicine and things seem to be gearing up to using that as a new paradigm.

**Speaker B** (08:40): Yeah. What they mean by evidence, explain that, is a study that cost maybe $150 billion and not just any researcher has that money to test, for example, a particular nutrient or hormone to treat a disease. So what constitutes good evidence in this new paradigm, the monopoly paradigm? It's a study that no one but the giant corporations can afford. And so the only drugs that have legal approval by the FDA are monopoly drugs. And the extent to which the state licensing wards are putting pressure on doctors to conform and follow guidelines in some situations it's just getting ridiculous that they're telling doctors, for example, not to consider any of the traditional signs of hypothyroidism in treating hypothyroidism, but to go only by the TSH to ignore all of the metabolic and functional signs that are recognized from 200 years as hypothyroidism.

**Speaker A** (10:10): It's a kind of communism. Right. Where there's only one, there's only one way.

**Speaker B** (10:19): Well, it's strictly monopoly capitalism.

**Speaker C** (10:23): Maybe totalitarianism.

**Speaker A** (10:26): Totalitarian. Okay.

**Speaker B** (10:27): Right.

**Speaker A** (10:27): Well communism for the pure definition of the word, maybe not. But it's very dictatorial.

**Speaker B** (10:37): Definitely.

**Speaker A** (10:37): Yeah. Okay. So you know you can't produce these drugs unless you can afford to play and when you do you get the monopoly and the, the payback keeps the system going and keeps the monopoly going in place. But just speak a little bit more about the evidence based medicine and the kind of destructive nature of it. You've mentioned the fact that doctors no longer can use reasoning and their brains. And I know, and I know them, I know some of them for sure, I don't know a lot of them, but I know some very well intentioned doctors, purely altruistic about what they want to do whilst you know, studying medicine. And when they're actually consulting with people, they really do have a genuine heart for the well being of the patient, you know, and quite probably the Hippocratic oath to exist too in their, in their prescribing. But in terms of a doctor using, using their reasoning and this evidence based, evidence based medicine paradigm being becoming something that is really in a place to inhibit and prohibit and punish reasoning, that's, that's very dangerous.

**Speaker B** (11:40): Yeah. In the newsletter I mentioned the movement to abolish the so called basic science part of medical education the first two years.

**Speaker A** (11:50): Right.

**Speaker B** (11:51): Where they actually study science.

**Speaker A** (11:53): Well, just describe that a little too, you know, just people hear it because most people won't subscribe to a newsletter and they probably won't understand, won't hear this. So just, just speak a little bit about that, about the person who came up with this ridiculous statement and how, what it implies.

**Speaker B** (12:07): Yeah, he has written articles pointing out that there have been over 350 reversals of traditional medicine done by these big gold standard corporate studies. And so he's seeming like a progressive, constructive person wanting to get truth into science. But he says these big studies are the evidence that we have to take into account and all we need is guidelines, what to do, how to use these approved, well documented, so called scientific treatments and if we have guidelines for all of the diseases, how to just follow a chart of reasoning laid out by the committee's government, basically, for treating a disease, everyone will treat the disease in the same way, becoming blind to the individual variations and their unique history. And it's trying to reduce and abstract medicine to the point that no brain is necessary, only following guidelines. Right.

**Speaker A** (13:46): You probably just need a simple flowchart. Yes or no? If A plus B equals C, go to D. Yeah. Oh my goodness.

**Speaker B** (13:55): And if that's the case, then they don't need the first two years of medical school because that's where they studied science. But the trouble even with that reasoning is that the sciences themselves over the last hundred years have been. All of the sciences related to medicine have been powerfully invaded by the drug companies. So that physiology, neurology, endocrinology, the kidney, heart, lung, brain, all of the systems of the body have had their understanding shaped by the reductionist ideal that one sickness can be defined for everyone and treated with a specific drug.

**Speaker A** (14:53): Scary. Well, hold on a second there. You're listening to Ask your Doctor on Camey D Gabable 91.1 FM from 8:30. Sorry, from 7:30 to 8:00 o', clock, the last half hour of the show, you were invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject. Based loosely on postpartum depression, new drugs that are coming out and things pathology surrounding pregnancy. The Number here is 707-707-986. Sorry. 923. Gosh, I'm making a few mistakes tonight. 707-923-3911. I'm just too excited and it is a solstice. So, Doctor, you're giving us your phone.

**Speaker C** (15:32): Number in all fairness?

**Speaker A** (15:33): Well, I gave you my phone number earlier. All right, so Dr. Pete, getting back to this new drug that's just been patented. It's a metabolite of a naturally occurring product called Allopregnalone and given as an infusion, cost $34,000. Reminds me of the harvonisovalde for Hep C treatment, which is 90 something thousand. And I saw more genetic ones. I saw one in England that just came out. It's $234,000 for the treatment. It's a new targeted antibody process where you individually send the patient's blood to a lab in North America. They basically just sequence it and they target the antibodies that they produce into the cell and send the blood back and the blood is then re infused into the patient. And they're saying that they're getting some fairly good results for lymphoma, but the side effects Seem pretty dangerous. Anyway, sorry to digress a little. But so far as the allopregnalone and its infusion is concerned, why wouldn't you know? Why couldn't you just use pregnenolone as a precursor or progesterone?

**Speaker B** (16:42): Yeah, someone tested that and found that just a tiny dose of oral progesterone, 20 milligrams, tripled the amount of allopregnenolone in the body.

**Speaker A** (16:55): 20 milligrams. Right. So there's absolutely no reason not to use orally progesterone or pregnenolone. And if the sole purpose of treating patients, I guess have been pre identified as having post postpartum depression because they're still in the hospital, in this hospital situation for a 60 hour infusion, that just seems, gosh, I don't know, it just seems like an expensive stay in a very expensive, you know, hotel. It's like a, I don't know, it's.

**Speaker B** (17:33): Just, yeah, ordinary reasoning would say that if you want to increase the amount of allopregnanoline in the brain, why not take 20 milligrams of progesterone, extra dollar or so?

**Speaker A** (17:48): I just don't think enough people know. And as time goes on, it just gets more and more buried. And if we're talking about evidence based medicine becoming this forced new standard and there is only one pathway through from diagnosis to prescription, you know, it's only something like the Internet that's going to keep this evidence or this information alive. But I, I know and I think it's happening more and more as time goes by. But when you search for things on Google or other, you know, search engines, I don't recommend Google for a minute, but I'm just saying when you search for things, a lot of things becoming very difficult to find and I know this happens, but I don't want to get off the beaten track with that, with that statement. So. Dr. P.

**Speaker B** (18:29): One other point is that allopregnanolone is essentially the end of a line of metabolites starting with cholesterol. And those are regulated at many steps before they come into existence. And so when you give the end product without looking at the condition of all of the preceding steps, that's a great opportunity for throwing the whole system out of balance. For example, estrogen and aldosterone are other end products of a line of steroid metabolism. And each of those has a long history in which it turns out that their excess is very dangerous. I don't know if anything like that will turn out for using the simple allopregnanolin without any of its precursors. But it's something they haven't examined.

**Speaker A** (19:36): Right. A little bit too new. That reminds me. And I found a kind of, I think there's a reasonably good link here between the GABA receptor, that valerian, a common medicinal herb used for anxiety and insomnia, valerian acts on a GABA receptor in the brain. GABA receptors are mediated by chloride ions and they cause inhibition and sedation and they calm excitability down. So they're anti excitotoxic. So I saw a study here with allopregnalone. It was actually a fairly old article. It was a 2006 article from a university in Sweden in Umea. And they noted that the, the thing was biphasic. They're saying, and this reminds me, like I said, of valerian, because most people use valerian for insomnia and overexcitation. It calms people down. That's what, you know, that's what it's traditional use has always been for. But I've noticed, definitely, and I know other people that practice herbal medicine in England and see a lot of people and use and prescribe valerian, have noticed that there is a small subset of the population that actually gets stimulated by it. And this article about allopregnanolone said the same thing, that at certain doses it was excitatory and at other doses it had more of a calming stabilizing effect. Do you.

**Speaker B** (20:58): That's the sort of thing you risk when you're using an end of line metabolite because normally it can never get above a certain level because it has to go through all of these stages in which each precursor produces some kind of smaller amount of product. And so if you artificially give an amount that the body could never experience on its own, then you're going to, for example, possibly anesthetize some of the regulatory inhibitory nerves and release things that are less sensitive to inhibition. So what you're doing is risking something that the organism has never experienced before and is unpredictable.

**Speaker A** (21:54): Yeah. What I was going to ask you a little bit later on, but probably now is a good time to ask you the question about postpartum depression for which this drug has been approved and your, your understanding of the cause of postpartum depression, how this can be avoided by women if they do the right thing, because I believe, you know, it's very treatable.

**Speaker B** (22:18): Yeah, it happens in women with a history of stress, difficult pregnancy, difficult birth, or maybe those were routine, but maybe there was a history of stress earlier in life and each stage she was compensating for. But the burden of going through the pregnancy and birth, when you're building the baby's body and brain, if you don't have enough calcium available in your diet, for example, you increase your parathyroid hormone and take calcium out of your bones to build the baby's bones. And vitamins and hormones are. The baby gets priority over some of these nutrients. And so even in an apparently healthy woman, the pregnancy increases the risk of a nutritional deficiency. And the fact is that the women who suffer postpartum depression have had some kind of a history of preceding stress.

**Speaker A** (23:36): Okay. Do you think there's any relation to menstrual disorders?

**Speaker B** (23:42): Because I think pms Exactly. Is closely related to postpartum. Yeah.

**Speaker A** (23:49): Okay. All right. So you're listening to ask your Dr. Kamie D. Galville, 91.1 FM. And from 7th and here in a few moments until the end of the show, you're invited to call in the questions related or unrelated to the subject here. And it's 707-923-3911. Okay, so I wanted to ask you again about exposure to high levels of estrogen. If we would tenant posit the suggestion that exposure to very high levels of estrogen being directly responsible for the dramatic shrinkage in gray matter of the brain, which has been shown, which women refer to as baby brain, in which the MRI studies confirm, being analogous to advanced aging. Why isn't progesterone supplementation after birth recommended to speed up recovery of the gray matter resolution, as it's clearly been shown to reverse the effects? And what would be a reasonable amount of progesterone postpartum and for how long?

**Speaker B** (24:49): In healthy women, the progesterone level in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma increases considerably during the time when the brain is being repaired after the stress of pregnancy. But the amount of cholesterol can be determining normally during this time of progesterone increase in a healthy woman after the birth, cholesterol is well above normal and is the precursor for making the large amount of progesterone. Women with postpartum depression typically have a reduced level of cholesterol, and so they just couldn't possibly make enough progesterone if the precursor isn't there. And vitamin A and thyroid are other limiting factors. So even if the cholesterol is there, but they're low thyroid or have a vitamin A deficiency, then they won't make the restorative amount of progesterone and like that, one experiment showed 20 milligrams orally of progesterone is enough to triple the amount of alloprognanolone. But a normal cycling woman produces about 30 milligrams of progesterone daily in the luteal phase. So I think that would be a reasonable amount therapeutically in the postpartum time. But the requirement depends. If she's still under stress and producing or not eliminating estrogen as well as she should, then it might take larger amounts. And that depends on things like your thyroid function, cholesterol level, vitamin A and stress hormones.

**Speaker A** (27:00): Okay. I've heard you mention in the past hydroxymethylbutyrate as a possible compound to improve cholesterol levels. But you've always mentioned lots of fructose with a healthy liver and thyroid also being responsible for improving cholesterol levels. And these specifically to enable downstream manufacture of steroid and neuroprotective hormones like progesterone in females, etc. Do you have any other suggestions for increase. It seems a little odd to ask, but for increasing cholesterol levels.

**Speaker B** (27:44): I think having enough carbohydrate sugar in the diet is a very important thing. Okay.

**Speaker A** (27:52): Sugar and carbohydrate. All right. Okay, so next question then. And I've wondered this, I don't have any evidence for it, but I'm going to put it out then you probably thought about it. So I think it's a good, a good point to ask you. Do you think there is a subset of women who, despite the massive rise of progesterone they benefit from during pregnancy, are still actually estrogen dominant, essentially?

**Speaker B** (28:16): Oh, sure, yeah. Especially if they had a history of PMS or any kind of biological stress. And most often it's associated with slightly low thyroid function.

**Speaker A** (28:33): Okay, so that can exist. It's only because I've seen the numbers that they are put out there, whether it's medical publications or alternative. But the huge increase in progesterone you would think will outweigh the, you know, the rise, because I know it's also a concomitant rise of estrogen. But do you have any idea of the proportion of.

**Speaker B** (28:57): Yeah, about 50 years ago I saw a good chart based on very large number of pregnancies in which there was a steady increase of progesterone through the whole pregnancy. Just a very steady increase at a level, I think it was 50 times higher than the estrogen level. And charts are very misleading. Usually they often graph them with different axes for estrogen and progesterone so it really should show an extremely low line for the estrogen being 50 times lower on the concentration.

**Speaker A** (29:51): Okay. But it is still very possible to be estrogen dominant during a pregnancy. And regardless of the amount of progesterone being secreted, which is pretty high, especially.

**Speaker B** (30:01): Yeah, you have a limited capacity to carry progesterone because of this needing 50 times more than estrogen. And so if your background estrogen is staying high because of low thyroid function or a low B vitamin or low protein intake or something, then it's impossible to produce and distribute enough progesterone to offset that falsely high amount of estrogen.

**Speaker A** (30:37): Interesting.

**Speaker B** (30:38): And so no amount of progesterone increase will make that pregnancy healthy. It requires getting the estrogen under control with nutrition and good thyroid function.

**Speaker A** (30:49): Okay. All right. Well, before we take this first caller, let me just say that from now until the end of the show, if you'd like to call in the number 707-923, 3911. Let's take this first call a call away from. What's your question?

**Speaker B** (31:04): New York.

**Speaker C** (31:05): And two questions for Dr. P. First, I guess you're not a fan of vigorous exercise, but I've read that as long as you're not running a marathon, if you're running for 20 minutes or whatever and you're doing sprints, that it actually increases CO2. Do you agree with that? Because I know nitric oxide and lactic acid are the ones that you want to avoid excess amounts of.

**Speaker B** (31:34): Entirely on your physiology, especially your thyroid function. A person with borderline hypothyroidism, well, with just the most slight exertion, will start producing lactic acid, which displaces the carbon dioxide. And so if you're really in great condition, you can keep your carbon dioxide level up and not produce any lactic acid with a moderate amount of exercise.

**Speaker C** (32:13): Okay, so it's not. Whether or not it's useful or not is sort of depending on the. The health of the individual, I guess.

**Speaker B** (32:18): It could.

**Speaker C** (32:19): For a healthy person, it could be very positive. For an unhealthy person, it could be very, you know, add to their problems, essentially, is what I hear.

**Speaker B** (32:26): Yeah. When, when the lactic acid goes up because you're not using oxygen properly, then you release first a lot of histamine, which produces soreness and, and maybe asthma and various symptoms. And then the histamine is causing the blood pressure to go down after the exercise. But with greater exercise, then you release serotonin from the mast cells that could cause a blood Pressure spike, which is much worse than just the histamine effect.

**Speaker C** (33:04): Okay, so just second part of my first question. If you take the assumption that people over 50 are predominantly hypothyroid, even if they weren't in their earlier years, and 60, certainly, then if people are exercising, what are the two things that people should do? I've heard one from your talks that if you take Maybe even just 3 drops or 60 IUs of vitamin E, that that would actually be very protective. And so the benefits of exercise might outweigh the negatives because you're taking precautions prior to the exercise.

**Speaker B** (33:36): Is that true? And a lot of athletes are starting to use baking soda before the stressful exertion that provides extra sodium and bicarbonate and CO2.

**Speaker C** (33:52): Okay, so both. Both of those are protective. So if you did that and you had a little bit of sugar or whatever, orange juice, that would somewhat mitigate the DNA damage or whatever that might occur.

**Speaker B** (34:01): Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker C** (34:02): Second question relates to. I don't know if you've heard of this, but it's called cat's claw, and supposedly what it does, it's a. I think a root bark that ultimately, if you boil it for 30 minutes, and maybe it's like mushrooms, where you know there's bad things in them, but if you boil it for an hour, you know, the bad things go away and all the good stuff stays. But it supposedly repairs DNA, and it's been used for, like, 1,000 years by the Aztecs and Incas. Have you familiar with it at all, or do you agree or disagree with it?

**Speaker B** (34:34): What's the name of it again?

**Speaker A** (34:35): Cat's claw.

**Speaker B** (34:36): Cat's claw.

**Speaker C** (34:37): C, A, T, S and then C.

**Speaker B** (34:39): L, A, W, I. Oh, no, I've never studied that.

**Speaker A** (34:43): All right. Okay, so you're talking about a product called Uncaria tormentosa. And. Yeah, and they've produced. It was a big deal for Lyme's disease. About five, four or five years ago. They produced, or in fact, a company called Mediherb in Australia produced a toa free, which is the oxy indole alkaloid that was supposedly responsible for, you know, mitigating the effects of Lymes. The. I'm not too sure of its activity for what you're mentioning, but I know it in the context of its use in Lyme's disease.

**Speaker C** (35:22): Okay, so it is. So there is some benefit to it.

**Speaker A** (35:24): Well, definitely for Lymes.

**Speaker B** (35:26): Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker C** (35:27): The other question I had is, you know, you talk about vitamin K, then There's the vitamin K2. There's MK4 and MK7. And, you know, you see MK7. But my understanding, sorry, there's MK1, MK4, and MK7. If you're supplementing vitamin K, is it appropriate to make sure that you have just MK4? Because that's the one.

**Speaker B** (35:52): That, that.

**Speaker C** (35:53): That is the most important for the.

**Speaker B** (35:56): If you eat animal liver, you're getting the whole variety of them, and that's because the liver can convert K1 or K2 to the other higher chains. And so I think K1 is adequate or K2, because our liver can make the others.

**Speaker C** (36:18): Our own livers.

**Speaker B** (36:19): Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay.

**Speaker C** (36:21): All right. So if I may. So I have a thought. If your thyroid's active, that means that your adrenals are inactive. So I think they work in reverse. So if you take an example of someone who's always low thyroid and their adrenals are very active, so that. So that they're generating lots of cortisol throughout their whole life, since that's the fight or flight response, if they train their body to chronically produce that cortisol to make up for their chronically low thyroid activity, is it conceivable that those people, because it's fight or flight, that they, in the absence of some sort of crisis, that they might actually try to create a crisis to essentially enable them to maintain that wrong cycle? I mean, it sounds crazy.

**Speaker B** (37:14): No. In the early 60s, that was a very common idea among psychologists and psychiatrists. And I've known people that seem to typify that condition where they know how to create excitement and turmoil.

**Speaker A** (37:37): So you agree.

**Speaker C** (37:38): So you agree with it. And then the solution then would be to try to get your thyroid action up, because then. And to really change the cycle to make sure your thyroid's active with all the ways that you've described.

**Speaker B** (37:48): Yeah. People who had been creating turmoil just sit around and enjoy and smile.

**Speaker A** (37:57): Okay.

**Speaker C** (37:58): All right, thanks very much.

**Speaker A** (38:00): Yeah, appreciate your call, caller. Okay, so the number, if you're in the area or even out of the area or even on a different continent, it's 707-923-3911. Okay, so, Dr. P, just moving on a little bit from postpartum depression, but still keeping the thread of where we're going with the hormones and. Or the approach to the treatment. Apart from progesterone supplementation, could anything else be done for women who exhibit gestational diabetes as a symptom of this kind of energetic defect?

**Speaker B** (38:37): Yeah, I started thinking in relation to the previous question that it isn't just a matter of the thyroid and adrenals, but all of the hormones are involved in the energy process. And so the importance of sodium and calcium in pregnancy, it isn't just for blood volume and bone building and such, but those are closely involved with thyroid in avoiding the adrenal stress, hormone excess and keeping up the energy system.

**Speaker A** (39:16): Okay, all right. Because it seems time and time again the prerequisite here is metabolic energy. And it's that defect here that's largely in part for causing everything else to fall with it. And so thyroid hormone and those things that support an active thyroid and the uptake by the cell and. Or the secretion.

**Speaker B** (39:39): Yeah. And people who, who have a history of stress, besides all of the essential nutrients, protein and vitamins and trace minerals and so on, will have an increased requirement for sodium and calcium and the vitamin D to help assimilate the calcium.

**Speaker A** (40:01): Okay. I had a question that was written to me about a website this person had visited. And this person was a doctor, excuse me, I think they're a naturopath. And it was devoted to the idea of chronic vitamin A toxicity as the underlying cause of most conditions. And I quote the statement there said, the basic premise is that many autoimmune diseases are caused by being in a chronic state of elevated storage levels of retinol, retinoic acid, and possibly the carotenoid vitamin A precursor. Do you have any comment about this website's author and what was your views on the necessity of vitamin A B? And are you aware of toxicity in general with this?

**Speaker B** (40:51): It is used to make these steroid hormones, all of them from cholesterol, thyroid and vitamin A travel together on a protein in the blood. They're so closely associated and are taken up by the steroid producing cells together. So you just don't produce steroid hormones, for example, without vitamin A and it's used in protein synthesis, making hair and skin and so on, will fail if you're deficient in vitamin A, mucous membranes thicken and stop producing mucus with a vitamin A deficiency. And someone sent me these books, a recent author, claiming that there is vitamin A toxicity rampant. And I looked through it and couldn't find any facts at all.

**Speaker A** (41:52): All right, so you were contacted by somebody who had a similar question about vitamin A toxicity being, you know, touted as being the causal.

**Speaker B** (41:59): Yep. Many, many years ago, some arctic explorers ate polar bear liver and their skin got inflamed and started peeling off. And that has been cited in textbooks for, I guess, 80 years or so as proof that vitamin A is toxic. But you Know, polar bears sometimes eat fish that have been poisoned by algae and their livers will store that for up to 24 hours at a very toxic level. And they might have just gotten some fish toxin, algae toxin by way of the fish. So even that very famous basis for claiming vitamin A toxicity, there's no fact. Okay. And when the drug companies were coming out with things like Retin A, there were sudden news releases all around the country from medical schools reporting incidents in, in which people, for example, went blind from taking vitamin A. And one of them at the University of Oregon, I phoned the department and tried to get in contact with a professor who had told that to a newspaper. I couldn't get any personal verification. I think they were all just made up with the encouragement of the drug companies to create the desire for the safe, non toxic synthetic vitamin A's.

**Speaker A** (43:46): Interesting. I just quickly. Can I ask you about vitamin B12? Because I wasn't going to as part of the outline that I'd produced for the show, but given that I do, I do and have seen lab work where people's vitamin B12 is outside the range and is pretty high.

**Speaker B** (44:08): It can be produced by bacteria in the intestine. And I've seen probably a dozen people with extremely high vitamin a or vitamin B12 who weren't eating any source of it. But I think it must be coming from overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Years ago I knew a guy who was very sick, a vegetarian, and he showed me his blood tests had extremely high carotene and extremely low vitamin A. And knowing that vitamin B12 is used in converting carotene to vitamin A, I suggested that he eat some vitamin B12. Within just a few days, his vitamin A was up to normal. The carotene had gone down and all his symptoms had disappeared.

**Speaker A** (45:03): Cool. Okay. All right, so you're listening to ask your Dr. K Med Galville 91.1 FM. From now until the end of the show, 8 o', clock, you're invited to call in with any questions number 707-923-3911. Okay, and we'll, we'll carry on here with the other questions that I've got for you. On the lights flashing, I was wondering if people everybody's out for the solstice celebrate and that they're going to hear this later on in the archives. I regularly get people emailing me. They've listened to the show on the archive and they ask questions, you know, there and then on emails. But I was wondering, the phone's ringing. And let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where you're from.

**Speaker D** (45:40): Hi, I'm curious, I have been hearing from a lot of my football friends lately. There's product out in Texas called pickle juice. Are you guys familiar with what the pickle juice constituents of pickle juice are?

**Speaker C** (45:55): A lot of athletes drink pickle juice.

**Speaker A** (45:57): I drink kimchi juice for the salt to put off cramps. Right, okay, but do they say what.

**Speaker D** (46:02): It contains that is, well, it's, it's astringent. You know, it has obviously has pickles that are, you know, molecularized in it. And it's, you know, it's something they, they claim it's for people who have hangovers. And, you know, we know that in our little town, people have a hell of a hangover and that's why they drink their coffee in the morning. Curious to know if you guys know anything about that or you might want to look into that.

**Speaker B** (46:27): Dr. Pete I imagine it would contain lactic acid if it's the traditional way of making pickles. And salt and just some salty. Anything in the morning can be very settling.

**Speaker D** (46:46): Oh, very good.

**Speaker B** (46:47): Helps to regulate your blood sugar and lower the stress hormones.

**Speaker D** (46:51): I did have another question. I have contacted you in the past and it was concerning that monk fruit sugar. Have you done any more research on.

**Speaker B** (47:00): That by any chance? No.

**Speaker D** (47:02): Okay, well, I'll tell you just for the folks out there, pretty soon people are going to be able to eat their chocolate candies won't have any sugar in it. They won't have to look over their shoulders apprehensively at their doctors anymore. And they'll be able to eat a 36 count box of the monk fruit sugar because it's actually a cure all in China for diabetes.

**Speaker A** (47:23): All right, we'll keep our ears and eyes open and we'll see where the, see where the research comes from and see the published reports and look forward to that. I appreciate you coming. Cool. Thank you.

**Speaker B** (47:33): Thank you.

**Speaker A** (47:34): All right, Dr. P. I had again another, I wanted to post another email question to you for your response to it because that person was unable to call during the last show. It was about sle, systemic lupus erythematosis, typically characterized as an autoimmune disorder. And the butterfly rash is something that we were always told when we were doing pathology at school. And so the butterfly rash, the malar rash, was an outward classic sign of it. What do you, what do you know about SLE and what would be your approach to this quote Unquote autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and either the brain, the kidneys and other organs.

**Speaker B** (48:18): Like the other autoimmune diseases, it's much more common in women than men.

**Speaker A** (48:23): Right.

**Speaker B** (48:24): And animal models can be created with an estrogen excess. Estrogen activates a whole row of inflammatory processes. And thyroid and progesterone are things that have been pretty successful. Women that have believed they were going to have to have a kidney transplant or something when they took progesterone and thyroid found they had no more symptoms.

**Speaker A** (49:00): So you could definitely see it as an estrogen excess symptom.

**Speaker B** (49:05): Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A** (49:06): Okay, good. All right, well, we do have another caller here. So, caller, let's take this question. Where are you from? What's your question?

**Speaker C** (49:13): Jersey question.

**Speaker A** (49:16): There's a New Jersey or Jersey?

**Speaker B** (49:19): Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C** (49:21): There's a professor from MIT that's been studying glyphosate and some of the effects. And while she hasn't done the research on it, she seems quite knowledgeable, though she's probably not. She's an engineer by training and seems to have a hypothesis that glyphosate is so similar to the glycine molecule that it actually can potentially displace glycine, which seems to be similar to the notion that fluoride can actually displace iodine because it's so similar, which, you know, is obviously troubling for the thyroid, which is probably why they want the water fluoridated to mess people up. But do you know anything about how damaging glyphosate is? Because I know you've mentioned in the past it's water soluble, but the notion that it could replace glycine does that. That could seems to have more systemic issues. What's your thought?

**Speaker B** (50:15): I think it's very toxic at such small amounts, extremely small amounts, that interfering with glycine wouldn't do much at that tiny level. I think the mechanism is more likely related to DNA regulation.

**Speaker C** (50:43): DNA damage, yeah.

**Speaker B** (50:45): Okay.

**Speaker C** (50:46): So one other question relating to green vegetables. I know you've mentioned that they're a good source of calcium, but they have pufa in them. And just to clarify my understanding, I remember at one point you were saying that if you boil vegetables them like for an hour that they become or somehow the pufa content goes down and they become more of a proper food.

**Speaker B** (51:11): You can skim it. If any fat rises to the surface, you just pour that off.

**Speaker C** (51:18): Well, actually I wasn't talking about boiling them in water as opposed to actually steaming them.

**Speaker B** (51:23): Maybe.

**Speaker C** (51:23): Is there a difference? There or do you treat that the same? Because steaming them, you'd have the water boiling and you wouldn't really. There'd be nothing to pour off.

**Speaker B** (51:31): Yeah, yeah. I think it's an advantage to be able to pour off any of the fat that rises.

**Speaker C** (51:38): So you're saying it's better to boil them essentially, than to steam them?

**Speaker B** (51:41): Would be safer. Yeah. And to drink the liquid, because the magnesium and calcium, a lot of it goes into the water.

**Speaker C** (51:50): Oh, you're saying. And eat the vegetables?

**Speaker B** (51:53): Well, if you need carbohydrate and any protein and such, they do have that value. But the important magnesium and calcium, a lot of it goes into the water.

**Speaker C** (52:07): Oh, I see. And so does the pufa remain in the leaves even though you're boiling them, or does that mitigate itself, too?

**Speaker B** (52:13): Yeah, a lot of it remains tied into the proteins of the leaf. And when you eat it, your bile salts will cause you to absorb most of the PUFA that is associated with the protein in the leaf.

**Speaker C** (52:29): So you're saying no matter how much you boil it, that's one of the reasons why you don't eat green vegetables.

**Speaker B** (52:34): Yeah.

**Speaker C** (52:35): Okay, thank you very much.

**Speaker A** (52:37): There you go. Like it is. Okay, so we've got six minutes here. So if anybody else wants to call in with another quick question, that's fine. Otherwise we'll wrap up with another question. But 707-923-3911. Dr. P. I wanted to ask you about another. You may not have an answer to this, in which case I have one more question for you. But it came out today. I think they patented it and the FDA approved it. It's another drug and it's based on. Based on melanocortin, and it's used for females as a kind of Viagra alternative for increasing sexual arousal and appetite, both for men and women. And it's called Vi lisi. Do you know anything about it? If you don't, it doesn't matter. But.

**Speaker B** (53:27): No, but the principle two things stand out. The pro opioids. Melanocortin is the precursor protein for making melanocortin and beta lipoprotein and the endorphins and acth. And so those are things that come up during the stress reaction. And so the melanocortin and its receptors are normally activated during stress. And again, if you take one of the end hormone products and take it out of the context of the rest of the stress reactions, you're going to have wildly unpredictable effects. And the suppression of appetite is one of the things known to be associated with those receptors, if a woman is lacking desire for a physical reason rather than just social, there are probably serious metabolic problems that are going to be ignored if you just try to push up one single mental function. And you should be looking at the. For example, the DHEA is a great activator of libido, but it goes down under stress. When cortisol rises, the cortisol has an anti libido effect suppressing the effect of dhea. So you should be concentrating on lowering the stress and if anything, giving a boost to the anti stress sickness with pregnenolone progesterone or DHEA or thyroid.

**Speaker A** (55:23): Yeah. Okay. And very quickly, for people that are listening out there, don't just use dhea. You've always mentioned that DHEA should be used in conjunction with adequate thyroid, otherwise you can turn or convert some of that DHEA into estrogens. Correct?

**Speaker B** (55:36): Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A** (55:37): All right, thanks very much for your time. Dr. P. Is three minutes the top of the hour here and I'll let people know how to find you.

**Speaker B** (55:42): Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A** (55:44): Okay, so for people that have listened to the the show this evening, Dr. Ray Pete's website is www.raypeat.com. he's got lots of articles that he's written. He produces a newsletter, it's fully referenced and keep your, keep your eyes and ears out. The the show is going to be up on an Instagram page that's going to be dedicated to Dr. Pete what he actually said, not what. Unfortunately, some of the bloggers on the Ray Pete forum are just creating their own, their own imaginations and creating a theory from it. But just to make sure that people get exactly what's been said, it'll be posted on the Internet here or probably three or four months time busy getting together and collaborating with a very, very kind person who has agreed to type up a lot of the stuff and to put it up and I'll be collating it with that person and probably in three or four months we'll have a Instagram page dedicated to Dr. Pete's philosophies. We can be reached Monday through Friday or in fact Monday through Sunday. If you just want to leave a message or you want to write an email, it's andrewesternbotanicalmedicine.com or 1-888-wBM Herb, thanks for listening and until the third Friday of next month, thanks for joining.
