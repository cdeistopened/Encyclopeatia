**Speaker A** (00:00): Sa.

**Speaker B** (00:39): Okay, just like that. It's seven o'.

**Speaker A** (00:42): Clock.

**Speaker B** (00:43): You are listening to redwood community radio, kmud garberville, 91.1 fm and hd1 kmue eureka 88.1 fm and hd1 kla laytonville 90.3 fm on the web, kmud.org and in shelter cover at 99.5 on fm translator k258bq.

**Speaker C** (01:44): Well, good evening and welcome to ask youk Herb. Dr. This is June 17, 2022. My name's Andrew Murray.

**Speaker A** (01:52): My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Speaker C** (01:55): So once again, welcome to the show which runs from 7 till 8 o' clock and at 7:30 we open the lines up to invite callers in with questions related to this month's topic, which is going to be around food and the corporation's control of food and some ongoing numbers and statistics from the COVID outfall. And then we're going to get into some parts of the political discourse and involvement in big companies in the Ukraine and fertilizer production. And then hopefully we're going to get to the topic of the baby milk shortage, follow that up with some artificial meat topics and as always, have the great pleasure of having Dr. Pete's superb overview of a lot of things. And I guess it's part of his age that enables him to encompass 70. Well, he's certainly older than that, but it encompass at least 40, 50 years of time spent studying the subjects and another three decades on top of that of living for this amount of time to see the events unfolding that have done so. He's got a pretty good rounded view of many different subjects and obviously alternative medicine is one of them. And he's been obviously spending a large part of his life and his career looking at the research which is always the most interesting part of any of this factual, factual information. It's not just opinion. So once again, very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Pete Joy join us on the show. Dr. Pete, are you there?

**Speaker D** (03:29): Yes.

**Speaker C** (03:30): Okay. Well, if you don't mind me just for the next five minutes or so, I just wanted to run an introduction to some of the questions that I'll be asking you and getting your opinion on. But just wanted to wrap up last month's discourse. We talked about, you know, genetic modification and corporations with patent rights on intellectual property that they are saying, especially Monsanto with their genetically engineered seeds and the quote unquote moratorium that was on natural products certainly seems to have been put to one side now where naturally occurring products like corn, wheat and potatoes, et cetera, although they're natural. They have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified versions of them. And I think this also runs into vaccine technology and obviously the emerging infections that we've gone through since the late or mid-1990s, 1990s up until now, with COVID obviously being the major part of our prior two year discourse on the events of COVID I also wanted to remind people that the lawyer Reiner Formick is. Well, I think he's still presenting it, but has a huge amount of data on the website, which I would encourage everyone to look at as a superb chronologically documented series of allegations, which essentially he's charging crimes against humanity for many organizations, institutions and governments. And that website is a secure website. That should get you there. There's a bit more in the URL, but essentially raticle.org and then pandemic parallax view so lists every detail about the beginning from the Wuhan lab, Fauci, the funding of it all up until the present point, and why people have been so hoodwinked over what's happened. Also mentioned last month that the United nations has changed the terminology from technocracy to green economy and sustainable development and how that impacts us all very negatively because it sounds so innocuous and harmless. Sustainable development. Who doesn't want sustainability? We all do. I do. I want local markets, I want people growing food locally. I don't want huge corporations shipping food from one side of the world to the other and displacing rural farmers. You know, so we want sustainable development. But the words sustainable development have been couched in such a way as to embrace this technocracy, which we exposed last month as really beginning from about the 1920s. And Dr. Pete certainly weighed in on what he understands of technocracy, having lived through it. And then obviously the Rockefeller foundation and all the other power players that are forming the heads of government institutions and global organizations from the Codex Alimentarius series of programs that we did a long time ago. Rima Labo has exposed that as being part of a world government order to get us all to this point that we've heard recently about the Great Reset. So anyway, that was just an overview of last month I wanted just to open up this month, and I hadn't mentioned this earlier, Dr. Pete, but it's something that caught my eye was when I was looking at the information for this month's show that the fifth largest life insurance company in the US has just paid out 163% more for deaths of working people, folks, not old people, just ready to die but working people from 18 to 64. So that group they've paid out 163% more for deaths for that age group. So the company cites that non pandemic related morbidity and unusual claims adjustments is the explanation of losses from group life insurance businesses and the stock is falling and the CEO has been replaced, et cetera. And they're trying to prop this up. So the head of an Indianapolis based insurance company, One America said the death rate is up a stunning 40% from pre pandemic levels among working age people. Now, five months after breaking this story of the CEO of One America, insurance companies saying deaths among working people ages 18 to 64 were up 40% in 3Q21, a new report is out that a much larger life insurance company, namely Lincoln national reported 163% increase in death benefits paid out under its group life insurance policies in 2021. To quote One America, the company CEO Scott Davidson stated that we are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business. Not just at One America, the is consistent across every player in the business. Now One America is a $100 billion insurance company that has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1877. The company has approximately 2,400 employees and sells life insurance, including group life insurance to employees and employers in the state. Davison said the increase in death represents huge huge numbers and that it's not elderly people who are dying, but primarily working age people 18 through 64 who are the employees of companies that have group life insurance plans through One America. And what we saw just in third quarter, we're seeing it continue into fourth quarter and that is that death rates are up 40% over what they were pre pandemic. Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three sigma or a one in 200 year catastrophe would be 10% increase over pre pandemic. So 40% is just unheard of. Now what is driving this unprecedented surge in all cause mortality? It was not only deaths of working age people that shot up to unheard of levels in 2021, but also short and long term disability claims. Now if this holds true, then the genetic vaccine so aggressively promoted have failed. And the clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with life saving drugs has contributed to a massive avoidable loss of life. At worst. This report implies that the federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appeared to be a true crime against humanity, massive loss of life in presumably workers that have been forced to accept a toxic vaccine at higher frequency relative to the general population of Indiana. And furthermore, we've also been living through the most massive globally coordinated propaganda and censorship campaign in the history of the human race. All major mass media and social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of the genetic vaccines and or alternative early treatments. Between artificial intelligence powered algorithms and social media tech giants complicit in their communist style suppression of information, we've witnessed an avoidable mass casualty event needlessly caused by a mandated experimental medical procedure which obliterated and eviscerated the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States in the process. How, you may well ask yourself, did this happen? By deceit, collusion and corruption. All tools used by evil people with wicked intent against their brothers and sisters, an international corrupt cabal, as well as by our very own complacency and failure to speak out en masse. So, Dr. P, with that introduction, I'm sure it's not news to you. I know you've been pretty tirelessly talking about this since the very beginning of 2020. What are your interpretations of this insurance company's disclosure of these facts? Revealed by public records request? It wasn't freely sent out, but a company requested this.

**Speaker D** (11:39): Several other companies since then have reported very similar increased mortality around 40% in the working age group. And so insurance companies generally have extremely accurate statistics, better than governments as a rule, because their income depends on exactness. And so it's really the scientific basis for saying that it wasn't the virus that's responsible, but the vaccination. That's when the 40% rise began. And it fits the virologists, the skeptical virologists have been claiming that the mortality is going to be far, far worse from the vaccine than from whatever occurred from the virus.

**Speaker C** (12:59): Because I think that was the point that was made mentioned that it was all cause, malice or cause mortality in young people. And it was a lot of it was to do with damage and disability. So whether the death may have been, you know, caused by the vaccine or not, the amount of money paid out due to the disabilities that were claimed, I think this is a pretty stunning part of the numbers that were used to cite the payments. And I think we've mentioned in the past that the, when we're describing things like mortality and altitude, it was the very insurance companies that actually let that information out which supported that claim that that lower premiums were basically imposed on people at high of altitude because they really were not as likely as people at sea. Level to die. Yeah. Okay, so that's, that's the first thing. Just seeing some kind of glaring headlines about the deaths and insurance companies making payouts and how this is now just part of the fallout of COVID and everything that happened to quote, unquote, try to mitigate this virus. Anyway, so that's been fairly, fairly long, a fairly long process here for the last two years now. And supposedly now what we're seeing, and not supposedly, but I think it's the actuality of it all with Omicron. Whether or not Omicron, I don't know if you, if you feel that. Whether or not your opinion is that Omicron is a naturally produced variant or indeed any other type of it, has.

**Speaker D** (14:43): The most bizarre gene sequences of all of the other variants. Because starting with the Wuhan, the other variants show a series of mutations building on each other. So the most recent, until Omicron, showed exactly the same series of mutations incorporated. So it was definitely that virus improving its survivability by mutating. But the Omicron is unique. It didn't show any mutations after Wuhan. While the Wuhan virus was going through all of these changes, nothing was happening at all to the Omicron. Suddenly when it pops up, it is essentially the pristine Wuhan virus with a new series built right on the original virus. None of the history of natural mutation, as if it was being held aside and going through a different series of mutations as if it wasn't in the world at all for these intervening years.

**Speaker A** (16:34): So are you. So are you saying that basically the original Covid went through mutations and you can track that, and then all of a sudden Omicron was like the original with just some alterations to it. So it looked like it had been lab produced or produced in a lab.

**Speaker D** (16:54): Yeah. And those mutations made it much less harmful. So if someone was preparing a product to end the pandemic by turning it off with a fairly harmless virus.

**Speaker A** (17:17): So do you think that if people have Omicron and they've developed antibodies to that and caught that naturally, even though it's not a naturally mutated virus, then will they be better able to fight the original Delta or those other variants?

**Speaker D** (17:35): No, it won't especially affect them. It'll just. If it's the dominant virus and it's very harmless, then the other one just isn't going to be around to cause trouble.

**Speaker C** (17:56): Okay, you're listening to ask your EB Dr. Knudg Galville, 91.1 FM from 7:30 to the end of the show. Callers are invited to call in with any questions either related to this month's discussion or indeed any other questions they'd like to pose to Dr. Pete about health related or quote, unquote, alternative medicine. The number 707-923-3911. So from 7, 7:30 till the end of the show, 8 o', clock, callers call in to 707-923- 3911. Okay, so moving on to the kind of major content of this next 40 minutes, 45 minutes. I read an article about the Oakland Institute. And this was a 2014 article. And the article certainly, yeah, nearly eight years, eight years later, what we're seeing now in Ukraine and Russia. It's kind of not really a political question, but it's really a question that's embroiled in health and government control and takeovers and, you know, aggressive campaigning of which, you know, people have certainly heard a lot about Roundup and Monsanto, and we've all heard about GMO and Monsanto, and it's a huge corporation. So the Oakland Institute, like I said, published a 2014 paper outlining what was being described then as a global corporate takeover of agricultural land in the Ukraine. And when you look at Ukraine, it's been hailed as the breadbasket of Europe with a staggering 32 million plus hectares of incredibly fertile black arable soil. Now, for those of you who are gardeners or horticulturalists or farmers, you're well aware of what this means to crops planted in short, lush, rich, fertile growth with excellent crop yields and quality harvests. If you too are Monsanto, one of the biggest agribusinesses on the planet, or one of a handful of other players buying into this hugely profitable location, rights to ownership and to play this game is extremely lucrative. And corruption, as always, exists at the highest level for the highest returns. Naturally, Ukraine's agricultural land was under a moratorium that banned its sale through January 1, 2016. And when Ukraine separated from the Soviet Union in 1990, collectivized communal farms were disbanded and land was distributed in parcels of approximately 4 hectares each to people living on the collectivized farms. In 2001, Ukraine passed its Land Code legislation that gave people functional titles to land. And since then, there's been a moratorium on the sale of land, which, as noted, was extended through January 1, 2016. The moratorium on land sales applies only to agricultural land, making it both legal and affordable for investors to build and operate a 100% foreign owned processing facility on its own industrial land while leasing fields from agricultural landowners. Until the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land was lifted. A second way that investors could circumvent the land moratorium was by buying shares of large existing Ukrainian agribusinesses. The system of land distribution in the 1990s often led to the concentration of land in the hand of a few elites. Alongside land opportunities in Ukraine for development, production and use of agricultural inputs like seeds, agrochemicals and fertilisers have attracted investment by agribusiness giants Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont and others. So I was going to ask you, Dr. Pete, you had lots of other information to tie this.

**Speaker D** (21:59): Everyone has heard about the International Monetary Fund offering the Ukraine a $40 billion loan if they would stop the moratorium specifically so Monsanto and the other giant corporations could concentrate ownership on a big corporate scale. And that there was a coup to make that happen because the election presidency had rejected the IMF fund. And the IMF working with World bank and all of the other so called Western authorities. Wanted to reverse that stops the moratorium. And so they supported the coup. And the coup was very clear that they were going to adapt laws that would let Monsanto take over. And when the coup happened, in fact that did take place. And so they had to get rid of the legally elected president and establish the Zelensky government supporting the Monsanto privatization system.

**Speaker C** (23:54): So how do you see Russia's involvement? I mean, because this seems to be a two sided story. Some people say that you know the Ukraine from a political and or ownership geographical perspective.

**Speaker D** (24:06): Well, part of the Monsanto thing is that they want to use chemicals Roundup to make the profitability of certain giant land corporations favorable to them. And the European Union had opposed the United States policy of supporting Monsanto and genetic modification. And so the there was a conflict between Western Europe who had quite a lot of resistance. Several European, Western European countries went along with wanting to outlaw GMOs. And that was creating stresses between Western Europe and the anti GMO people. And it turned out that historically Russia had been passing laws to promote organic farming and to outlaw GMOs. And so they were aiming for a hundred percent freedom from GMOs and naturally from Monsanto. And. That really was the polarization for the coup for the International Monetary Fund loan. When the elected president made a deal with Russia for a loan that would bypass the International Monetary Fund. That was the actual moment when the coup took place and got him out of part of Ukraine.

**Speaker C** (26:37): I read well I think a couple of years ago and so you can back me up on this. That Vladimir Putin was boasting that he was going to make Russia one of the, if not the biggest organic food producer in the world.

**Speaker A** (26:54): Yeah, that's what one of his goals was. But I mean I thought GMOs are still banned in Europe.

**Speaker C** (27:00): Well, I think they are in England. I'm pretty sure England had banned gmo.

**Speaker A** (27:04): No, I thought in England they're not banned, but because they're not part of the EU. So the EU is banned GMOs, is that your understanding, Dr. Peak?

**Speaker D** (27:13): They are wobbling on the issue that there is still opposition to it. But now the war for Monsanto has affected the West. They aren't pushing so hard to oppose the GMOs.

**Speaker C** (27:38): I wonder how the, the whole fertilizer shortage again. Apparently Ukraine is a big exporter or manufacturer of fertilizer. I wonder how that plays into it along with the, the agricultural rich diversity that there is possible there in Ukraine. And how this quote unquote food shortages. Now they're talking about. Before we get into the subject of baby milk, the food shortage issue. I wonder how, I wonder how politically motivated this is in terms of.

**Speaker D** (28:09): Oh, you can see many specific things in which it's been just openly promoted. For example, Union Pacific Railroad announced that they just weren't going to ship all of the fertilizer that the farmers needed. And that preceded by several weeks the announcement that they were not going to allow the shipment and sale of urea which is used in the diesel motors of trucks. And by restricting the availability of this urea fuel modifier, they can turn off truck delivery too. But as a railroad, they simply said they're not going to ship all of the fertilizer that's ordered.

**Speaker A** (29:28): And why did they say that?

**Speaker D** (29:32): No one knows. But it seems to be that they are controlled by Black Rock giant Fund Black Rock and that is also just openly intending to turn off the food economy.

**Speaker C** (29:56): I mean really.

**Speaker A** (29:57): So they want to create a shortage for some monetary gain?

**Speaker D** (30:04): Oh yes. If you look at the pattern over the last several years when at the very just weeks before the pandemic cloud swab was saying, well, we've done our best to use the carbon dioxide. Climate change mistaken science to fulfill our purpose of controlling the overall production. But now, luckily we've got something much, much better, that in just a period of two or three years we'll be able to turn off the national and world production of everything ordinary daily economy, including food and all of the necessaries of life.

**Speaker C** (31:12): You can't make this stuff up. And this reminds me of the whole discourse that I first heard with Rima LABO Back in 2006, I think it was Codex Alimentarius and how the entire thing is essentially a playbook from the end of the war or just before that, really, with the emergence of technocracy through to global governments and one world currency. It's all been documented. And she. The way she was Talking back in 2006, it blew me away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I just. Is this totally fantasy or is this. You know, I started looking into it and the more you look at it, the more connections you see. And so when we get things like the war in Ukraine and we hear, well, actually, maybe, you know, Russia was siding on the side of organic production and, you know, yeah, it was part of former Russia. And so what really is the problem? I mean, obviously there's a problem with people dying. Don't get me wrong, I'm not condoning war. But the reasons by which this happened are serious government evil prospects and control and manipulation of the populations of various countries to produce the narrative they want. And that's exactly what social media media has sought to bring about since it all came out for Facebook and YouTube and all of the glorious technology of social media, you know, the advent of it, you were back in 2009 or so when the iPhones were becoming really popular and the software to do this was connecting all these people like never before. So kind of, you know, it's. It might sound. May sound a little scary to people that are just listening to it, but there's a lot more in it. And unfortunately, I don't think there's a huge amount we can do about it except peacefully protest. And I think that's the saddest part of what I've witnessed going through these last two years, is that there's such a polarization, there's such a control of information on the one hand, that people are not getting the full information. I just heard today that Simone Gold, why, of the doctors in la, of the American frontline doctors who were organizing, you know, patient consultations and alternatives to Covid treatments that were, you know, the experimental drugs. She's just been in prison for two months. And this was all part and parcel of her 2020 appearance at the state Capitol and her peaceful protest. Yeah, peaceful protest. Basically saying that she objected to what was going on on. And that the whole thing about free speech is like, if we're not careful, folks, it's gone, you know, and getting ratted out by your neighbor is in and the Soviet style era of people watching people and people policing each each other. It's kind of a scary reality which I think has crept in so pervade, you know, pervasively with this Covid quote unquote pandemic that most people are looking, I don't know, I'm not quite sure where they're getting their information from that's countering this narrative that we hear about because it's, it's everywhere you look. I mean to find an alternative view on the COVID scenario is the kind of exception. Anyway, you're listening to ask Europe Doctor on CAMED Galvool 91.1 FM. From now until 8 o' clock the lines are open. Numbers 707 92. Once again, 707-923-3911. Okay, so getting to the milk crisis, the baby milk crisis. I wonder what your opinion of this is because I know you've definitely got lots to say about soy and PUFA and all of these things. I mean from a perspective of making money, from a corporate perspective of, you know, mothers in Africa. And I'm not saying that women that have children that don't produce enough milk shouldn't be helped. Of course not. But there are other alternatives to formula. So what do you think about this baby formula crisis? And it may be not a bad thing.

**Speaker D** (35:36): The SOYU formula had its own terrible side effects in immature animals. The estrogenic factors associated with the proteins used in making the milk substitute cause deformed genitals in the developing young and later promote tumors of various sorts. So the plant based milk formulas were a terrible problem in themselves. And Benzene Nestle Innovations basically selling dehydrated cow milk as a basis for people around the world to mix up at home to produce a liquid milk substitute, despite the fact that clean, clean water to mix it with is absent in so many of the poor countries. So they were doing something very counter social and dangerous. But the even in the US where people couldn't make a formula themselves, if they really couldn't produce milk, they could simply make a formula based on cow milk. And when it isn't dehydrated, the reaction on the immune system is less harmful.

**Speaker A** (37:50): To.

**Speaker D** (37:53): Take a non human milk and introduce it right at the very beginning will cause some antigenic differences. But at least if it's made from fresh cow milk, that's a lot safer than dehydrated because every time you dehydrate a living substance, you kill it and oxidize some of the proteins, amino acids, and especially the fatty acids, the cholesterol is oxidized. That's really only one of the fairly trivial problems of dehydrated milk is that the cholesterol is damaged and made toxic. But many, many other components of the milk are susceptible to oxidative damage. And there is a whole anti science that has grown up to defend the industry's use not only of dehydrated milk, but of the added polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is really a separate issue because they argue that human milk contained more PUFA than cow milk. And so that has been a separate industry to say that the baby must be given a supplement of N minus 3 fatty acids, because they say almost all babies at birth have evidence of a deficiency of N minus 3 fatty acids.

**Speaker A** (40:21): That's because the placenta's filtered it out.

**Speaker D** (40:24): Yeah, exactly. It is recognized as something to be excluded during pregnancy. But they reverse that and say you need to supplement everyone because everyone is deficient.

**Speaker A** (40:41): Because the body naturally tries to keep it away from the baby, you're deficient. That's just the rationale is insane.

**Speaker D** (40:51): And they extend that to say that the aged brain contains increased amounts of N minus 3 PUFA. And so they are wanting to say that because you find it in the old brain, that means it should be there. But meanwhile, the old brain has deteriorated in proportion to the reduction of mitochondrial energy production. And that reduction corresponds to the increased presence of N minus 3 poofa in the brain. So every point, they've twisted the science. And one of the ways they twist it is with certain tests of retinal responsiveness to electrical stimulation. And they say if you increase that with your added pufa, you're going to show that that addition makes the I develop faster and the brain developing its mental ability sooner. But that is all just fantasy speculation.

**Speaker C** (42:30): Okay, we got a call that came in. Apparently the caller wanted to ask a question off the air. So before we go to this next question, the lines are open. 707-923-3911. The number to call. So, okay, what was the question that was being asked?

**Speaker B** (42:46): So the caller wanted to know if you could talk about some good things for menopause, such as she's having brain fog and nausea.

**Speaker A** (42:56): Well, Ginger is always great for nausea.

**Speaker C** (43:01): Brain fog. Okay, so good. Nootropics. I don't know how supportive you are of nootropics outside of using anti stress substances like pregnenolone for decreasing cortisol and for decreasing inflammation. But what would your response to that be?

**Speaker D** (43:22): Oh, yeah, all of those things. Coffee, for example, aspirin, things that promote mitochondrial oxidative use.

**Speaker A** (43:38): And herbal support would be Vitex, chaste berry and black cohosh. Those are very effective at helping mitigate the menopausal symptoms.

**Speaker C** (43:52): Okay, so let's go on to the next question. I don't know if we've finished the milk.

**Speaker A** (43:57): Yeah, Dr. B, I wanted to ask a question about the milk. So all baby formula is dehydrated milk or dehydrated? Let's just say it's all dehydrated. So when you say make a formula out of milk, would you suggest adding anything to cow milk? Fresh cow milk?

**Speaker D** (44:18): Yeah. You can adjust the amount of fat and water if it makes it more palatable to the baby, but just as is, it'll work.

**Speaker A** (44:36): And so what about this talk in the news of a synthetic breast milk? What do you think of that?

**Speaker D** (44:45): Oh, it definitely works.

**Speaker A** (44:47): Do you think that would be preferable to cow's milk for babies or.

**Speaker D** (44:51): Oh, sure. Yeah. Well, assuming that the mother is eating properly because the human milk reflects the human diet, because we don't have a rumen, the cow can eat grass and weeds and quite a lot of polyunsaturated fats and detoxifies them in the rumen. So as a rule, Can say that if the woman is eating well, then her milk is going to be better than cow's milk.

**Speaker A** (45:45): Right. So the question I was asking is, of course, we all know that mama's milk, breast milk is preferable for a baby or the best, but with a healthy diet. But I've read about them making breast milk in a laboratory, trying to synthesize breast milk in a lab. I was wondering what your thoughts were on that.

**Speaker D** (46:13): Well, probably not good. It might have certain similarities to breast milk, but it's definitely going to be a synthetic material, chemical.

**Speaker C** (46:29): What about. What about the subject of artificial meat? And again, as between, you know, between milk and meat and canceling out substances like sugar, they must say, quote, they. Who are they? But the industry and whoever's behind the industry is seeking, I think, to separate people from their natural world. And I'm not saying, oh, everyone needs to drink milk, but I am saying that milk is an extremely good food, and I think there's so much evidence to support its use that the whole demonization of it is really the same kind of skewing the information that you're getting that you've given previous examples of in research you've mentioned recently about protein intake for older people necessarily needing to be Decreased. And that that's not a bad thing. So what about that in terms of the amount of. You've never been big on muscle meat per se. You've always encouraged people to use the whole animal. Getting the gelatin from making a broth, for example, of chicken or knuckle bones or, you know, lamb shank.

**Speaker D** (47:46): Yeah. For many years, people have been aware that with aging, the metabolic rate slows down. And Brod Barnes was thinking about that and the importance of the metabolic rate. And he had been using a supplement of, I think, two grains of armor thyroid. And he decided to go on a high protein diet when he was around 60, I think, and found that he had to double his dose of thyroid hormone to maintain his functioning. Showing that for an older person, what seems to be a good level of protein can actually be very powerfully suppressive to your thyroid function.

**Speaker C** (48:55): Okay, so we've talked about things like soy protein in the past being used as a meat alternative. We know that's definitely not a beneficial substance in terms of it raising estrogen in men and women and being relatively inflammatory in its own right. So I think it's just part and parcel of our human nature. And I think this really, for me, it's kind of speaking to the buyer beware mentality that I think everyone needs to try and hang onto and remember. Because I think it's just like social media and technology. We're kind of cajoled and lured into this kind of seemingly fuzzy world of comfortable technology, and we're really just sucking down so much poison that I think it's like being on drugs that are completely separating you from reality in terms of what's actually going on around you, that you don't say anything and you're just cajoled and fuzzily, oh, it's okay if the government knows what they're doing. This Covid vaccine's a good thing. It saves lives. What you're talking about, you're the crazy one. I'll bring that subject back out in a moment here, but we do have another caller on the air, so let's take this next call. A caller, where are you from and what's your question?

**Speaker E** (50:25): I'm from the Arcata area. I just wanted to make a comment, kind of looking at the general trend of things in this country where, you know, big corporations want to control everything or at least the bulk of the economy. So it had to do with seeds. Basically, you guys were talking about food and growing organic vegetables and stuff like that. And I was surprised, talking to one of the vendors at the farmer's market that she had to buy seeds. I don't know if it's some kind of license type of thing, but just looking at the trend of housing are evolving, I would expect that over time the seed supply is going to be completely controlled or mostly controlled by big companies. And it would behoove people to learn how to make their own seed, grow their own seed, save seed, and try to keep it from being contaminated with, I'm sure, genes that are going to be inserted to either, you know, make it so you could only grow seed and it won't reproduce or what have you. So I guess that was my comment. Just moving forward, that's a good thing for people to try to explore. Thank you for your show.

**Speaker C** (52:00): Yeah, you're welcome.

**Speaker A** (52:01): Thank you for your call.

**Speaker C** (52:04): Okay. Yeah, so, and I want to just kind of round follow up that. That caller with, you know, this really applies to people that are fortunate enough, you know, to have a garden. I'm not talking about acres of land, but I'm just talking about people that have a small garden, you know, to grow vegetables in. Because obviously, you know, and we've all known it, and it's happened in China quite successfully, where millions and millions upon hundreds, hundreds of millions of people were pulled out of rural agrarian locations and brought to the cities. It's all about the cities and it's all about the mass media control they have over populations. When you're in the cities and under their domain and you don't have a garden and you don't have a connection to the natural world, that's when all of this is breaking down. That's, I think, very, very similar to, you know, some of the kind of biblical references to that very same subject in like the Tower of Babel and how all of this was just a mass of confusion and, you know, God made it impossible for them to understand each other. And that was because they just wanted to get on with it without God and they didn't feel they needed any kind of natural creation they could do without, do without all of that. And I think, unfortunately, it's a kind of side effect of our human that, you know, we don't, you know, we're kind of numbed. And I think so many people, unfortunately, are just sucking it down, you know, and yeah, I find it hard to find it hard to believe in some ways that they're pulling it off. But I think what's happening really is a concerted and orchestrated attempt. And we're not even attempt. I think they're doing it. It's an orchestrated play and we're going through the motions. But I never give up. And I would encourage everybody listening never to give up. They're never. As far as I'm concerned, they're never going to win. You just have to keep resisting and keep resisting to the very end, because the end is not the end. Okay. So, yeah, Dr. P, again, like you've been. You've been around quite a while now and you've seen governments come and go and heads of state come and go, and you've seen lots of headlines and politics, etc. I don't know. I'll just ask you in these last few closing moments about your impression.

**Speaker A** (54:16): Yeah. Is there any hope of the world?

**Speaker C** (54:19): What do you think about it? I mean, I know we're still alive and we're still trying to do the right thing, but where are you? Where are you with all of this?

**Speaker D** (54:28): I'm still hopeful. Good. Like Reiner Fulness said, we have to do everything legal and possible to try to prosecute these people. But at some point he's going to count on some kind of a cosmic bailout for us.

**Speaker A** (55:01): Wait, wait. Reiner is counting on a cosmic bailout?

**Speaker D** (55:07): Yeah, I forgot his exact phrase, but interesting. He said he couldn't explain it rationally, but he had this confidence that the universe wasn't going to let that turn out the way the World Economic Federation.

**Speaker A** (55:24): Hopes or the imf.

**Speaker C** (55:28): Okay, well.

**Speaker A** (55:28): Well that's. Okay. Hopeful.

**Speaker C** (55:29): There's. There's hope then. Yeah. Well, good. I appreciate your time joining us on the show and only, only sad that we didn't have more callers, but I can only.

**Speaker A** (55:40): It's a busy weekend. People have rodeo and the summer arts.

**Speaker C** (55:43): Fair and that's local. I can only hope that people are listening. Listening and not calling in. But like I always say, the archive is there for people to listen to in the future. And the future will vindicate what you've said for a long time. So thanks so much again, Dr. Pete, for joining us.

**Speaker A** (56:00): Okay, thank you, thank you and good night.

**Speaker C** (56:03): Okay, so I just wanted to kind of finish off with saying that this connection is undoubtable, you know, between technocracy and dehumanization through lockdowns and social isolation. So with government coercive measures and Soviet era style social control where individuals are set against individual individuals, similar also to the brown shirts of Nazi Germany, the Orwellian reality we are now in and which, unless it's resisted, will become de facto the new normal and must be Resisted vehemently through peaceful protests and political involvement on the state and local level needs to occur. It's the reason we need another Hagen charges of international war crimes against humanity where the guilty are charged and why reinforce group in Germany is at this very moment pressing these charges. So the thing is ongoing. I like to think that there is a real justice and that we're not just going to be sucked into the matrix and we're not going to have any way through it. So do you say there's someone else who wanted to ask a question? Well, I think Dr. Pete's probably hung up by now anyway.

**Speaker F** (57:14): Hello?

**Speaker C** (57:14): Yeah, go ahead. We've got three minutes as well until the top of the hour.

**Speaker F** (57:17): Okay, a couple of things. One is.

**Speaker D** (57:22): The.

**Speaker C** (57:22): I don't even think we've got time. We've got three minutes. It's not going to happen. I'm so sorry. Okay, we better, we better call this it because I will run over.

**Speaker F** (57:31): So basically I want to know. Okay, they say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And you seem to to think that getting some kind of treatment is better than getting a vaccine to prevent the COVID And you know, I would rather not get it than have to, you know, get it and be treated for it. But so I'd like an answer to that question. And also basically, why do you think that the vaccine is worse for you than the COVID itself?

**Speaker C** (58:04): The information is out there for anybody who wants to search for it. So it's not something you're going to see on your Facebook group or on your YouTube channel or Google or the.

**Speaker A** (58:14): Fact checkers that check that work for Google.

**Speaker C** (58:17): And it is two minutes to the top of the hour. So I need to give credit to Dr. Pete and his website and his information. So appreciate your call but don't have time to answer it. I'm sorry. So, okay, for those of you who've listened to listen to the show they run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm we'll be back in July. We're coming up to solstice now. So we run a business called Western botanical medicine and Dr. Raymond Pete, his website is Ray Pete r a y P-E-A-T.com and he has got plenty of scientific referenced articles that are not his opinion but are pulled from current medical journals or past medical journals, medical research trials, etc, etc, and again may not be something that you'll find on your Facebook group or if you just Google it. Up until this point you're probably not going to find it, and some of it's going to be censored. And we're probably moving into a more censored environment as we go on, folks. So people just watch out, you know, anyway, without being alarmist about it. My name is Andrew Murray, and we'll talk to you again in July.

**Speaker A** (59:23): My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker D** (59:49): Sam.
