**Speaker A** (00:00): Well, welcome to this month's Ask Youkherb. Dr. My name is Andrew Murray. From 7:30 until 8:00 o', clock, the end of the show, we do a live or I do a live calling. I say we because Dr. Raymond Peet always joins us and has done for several years now the number of you want to reach us, I'd love to hear from you about either tonight's subjects, continuing topic of serotonin, inflammation, superoxide oxidants, antioxidants and several other subjects. But the number is 707-923-3911. For those of you who perhaps have never heard Dr. Pete, we'll be giving out his details at the end of the show. And for those of you who, who know a lot about him and listen to lots of what he's got to say and read his books, I'm sure you'll find this evening show just as informative. It's a once a month show that we do from 7 till 8pm and from 7:30 until 8 o' clock we do a live call in. So if people want to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's subject on continuing topic of inflammation, serotonin, etc. Number 700-792-33911. So from 7:30 on and if people want to line up ahead of time before that, that's just fine too because that also happens. So once again very pleased to welcome introduce Dr. Raymond Pete onto the show. Dr. Pete, you with us?

**Speaker B** (01:37): Yes.

**Speaker A** (01:38): Okay, thanks so much for giving your time again as you always do every third Friday of the month. For us, for those people who perhaps have never heard you or heard your name, heard you speak or know anything about you perhaps would you just outline your professional and academic background and then we'll get into tonight's topic.

**Speaker B** (01:55): Okay. I got a Master's degree with a thesis on William Blake from University of Oregon, 1960, and then taught various schools and colleges and in 1968 went back for a PhD in biology, University of Oregon, graduating in 72 and have been following up on pretty much the same interests ever since the 50s, studying how the brain and body work.

**Speaker A** (02:37): Okay, thank you. I was going to ask, I wanted to ask. I didn't prepare this ahead of time, but when did you stop seeing people in person? Because you used to consult with people, right?

**Speaker B** (02:51): Yeah, about 1990 I think it was.

**Speaker A** (02:55): Yeah. Okay. All right. Well I just wanted to let people know also. That's something I should have done at the very beginning of the show because I often find Myself wondering what month it was the show was done in. It's November, so November 15, 2019. So, Dr. P, carrying on from where we left off last month, talking about or discussing parts of your newsletter, but only a small part of it because we didn't get a lot of time to cover it. Excuse me, but I had some more questions then about tryptophan and serotonin, given that serotonin is formed from this amino acid, tryptophan, if we're to avoid this, because the whole egg aegis of this is that serotonin is an inflammatory molecule, it's responsible for many negative effects in the body. And obviously we'll get you to outline all of those things in detail here so people can understand just how you know, just how bad it is for you and its negative effects and why the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are so bad for you, given that they allow this product to remain in larger concentrations in the body. How best, how best can we avoid tryptophan ingestion in order to try and get an edge on the serotonin that would be formed from it?

**Speaker B** (04:25): Tryptophan and its metabolites, including serotonin, is essential for life. Every kind of organism is built with proteins containing tryptophan and the very nature of life, as I see it. And as Albert St. Georgi researched it, he, for the last 30, 40 years of his life, was demonstrating the electronic nature of life. The fluorescence, luminescence, electronic conductivity and such of living systems, the proteins interacting with water, producing excited electrons and light emissions. And tryptophan is the amino acid that gives proteins that basic property that, according to St. Georgi, is the essential mechanism of life that lets it sense and move. He was a muscle researcher, among other things. And this electronic property is at the heart of both sensation and movement and all of the other familiar properties of life, secretion, consciousness, and so on. So it's when something goes wrong with tryptophan or its metabolites, it disturbs life at its deepest level. Cell division and all other functions depend on this excitability of tryptophan. And in the muscle protein myosin, for example, there's one particular tryptophan which is most sensitive electronically and to light interactions such as phosphorescence. And this tryptophan interacts electrically or electronically with cysteine, which is an oxidizable sulfur protein. And these are the sort of the electric motor of all the life processes. And they happen to be the essential things during the growth process of an organism. But if you keep the same ratio coming in in your diet and stop growing, they are no longer being consumed in proportion for growth. And so they become sort of free actors which can spread excitability and oxidizability randomly in the organism. So during the growth period of an organism you need the full balanced range of amino acids. But when your body growth stops, all you need to maintain the renewal of your skin and intestine lining, lungs, all of the turnover brain proteins that are being renewed and so on. That's a very small amount of growth that's going on compared to in your infancy and teens. Those amino acids are now at risk of becoming random excitatory, inflammation promoting processes. And it happens that gelatin is a major protein that is used for building frameworks connective tissues and it has a complete lack of these excitable proteins, cysteine, methionine and tryptophane. And so if it becomes a major dietary protein when growth is completed, then you reduce the risk of the inflammatory and degenerative diseases.

**Speaker A** (09:37): Do you think this could be mitigated through? I mean I know you don't at all promote any aerobic exercise or stress inducing exercise, but given that I come from a kind of. Not that I am, but I come from a kind of bodybuilding perspective where you do recommend lightweight bearing exercise for people of all ages and actually very much support its use for producing muscle mass, muscle burning, glucose, being thyroid stimulatory and supportive. If these amino acids are being consumed and somebody's actually doing some work, then does that, would that warrant that diet remaining that way? Because obviously there's an ideal in life and you've mentioned the gelatin and it being completely absent from these inflammatory amino acids. But in terms of a balanced diet that would contain some of these, would you recognize work, doing work like lifting small weights and exercising your body is.

**Speaker B** (10:44): Yeah. By the age of 30 or 40, when growth is completed, the. A bulk of our energy is spent just in maintaining the body. But it has to function to be maintained and renewed. If you have a cast, for example, on your arm, muscles will atrophy because they aren't being used. So just to maintain what we have, we have to be active. And that includes mental or spiritual activity, keeping a freshness of perspective.

**Speaker A** (11:32): This is the environmental enrichment and.

**Speaker B** (11:38): Yeah, yeah. Stimulation of everything mental processes as well as. As a varied physical activity.

**Speaker A** (11:49): Do you think there's a place for people to get more. It's kind of outside the context of this month's show. But leading question from what you're saying. But in terms of people doing things that hopefully they're interested in, obviously outside the mundanity of work if they're not interested in that, but they have to do it. But actively engaging and pursuing things that require them to be mobile and engaging with the environment. Yeah. Environmentally enriching them to be a process that is supportive to the organism in terms of, you know, producing good, I don't know, not just feelings, but good, good, good results in terms of feeling fulfilled and that fulfillment transferring into a mind body state that's supportive rather than degenerative and reductive.

**Speaker B** (12:41): Yeah. It always has to involve newness and invention. Even conversations can be relatively athletic.

**Speaker A** (12:54): Okay. All right. You're listening to ask your herb doctor on cameud guy with all 91.1 FM and from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00 you invited a call in. The number to reach us here is 707-923-3911. And I just got to ask the engineer actually the clock is missing. There isn't. Where's happened to the clock?

**Speaker C** (13:13): I didn't actually go check in there to make sure the clock was there.

**Speaker A** (13:17): It's actually not here.

**Speaker C** (13:18): I suppose we should put that on our checklist.

**Speaker A** (13:20): Well, not a bad idea.

**Speaker C** (13:22): I'll start like going like that when you get towards the end and I'll start doing the music very quietly.

**Speaker A** (13:26): Well, I just want to make sure that.

**Speaker C** (13:28): Pay no attention, the music will get.

**Speaker A** (13:29): Loud and it'll just want to make sure that we have timely intervals, remind people who we are.

**Speaker C** (13:35): I will say opens. I will open the lines for calls at half past.

**Speaker A** (13:39): How about that? Sure. Okay. So Dr. Pete, carrying on about tryptophan. They've always mentioned that this should be imbalance and that's why you've always talked about gelatin, gelatin rich products because it's in the muscle meats where we get the greatest proportion of tryptophan. And that would be, you know, consuming excess amounts of muscle meats. And I think you don't rate more than 4 ounces or 6 ounces as being beneficial for us because of the tryptophan content.

**Speaker B** (14:08): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (14:09): So it's, I guess it's possible to, to avoid. And again this is kind of a little bit off topic, but I was, I looked at a program that was about plant based and I don't want to get into a discussion necessarily about plant based versus animal based proteins, but it was quite an interesting documentary about and I think they Followed several people, maybe four or five quote unquote athletes obviously, because I think they're at the top of their game. But these people were either vegan or just basically got all of their protein from non animal sources. It was all plant based proteins. And they. Ewan McGregor actually was, you don't have to know him of course, but he's like an MMA fighter and he was at the top of his game and he was fighting a title bout that was going to challenge him for his title. And the chap that he was fighting was a vegan. And in the interview, McGregor was really castigating him and saying that he was, you know, just a plant eating, you know, whatever, he was weak and he was going to destroy him in the fight. And McGregor lost and it was such a shock in the circle because he was at the top of his game. And they proved they were doing this physiologically showing that meat consumption. I'm not anti meat at all, you know, but they were showing that consumption of meat actually slowed the organism down. And it actually. I know you've mentioned things like cadaverine and putrescine as being byproducts of meat and Definitely. Which is why you advocate not hanging meat, you know, like they do in England. Perhaps they'll hang pheasants until they start falling apart. And same with that, you know, the venison. But anyway, getting back to this title fight, they said that they showed physiologically how it was slowing him down and that how his muscles were not able to repolarize reactors repair as quickly and recover as quickly. And they were saying that it was pretty much based on his diet and they were really, they were really putting meat consumption down. But I don't know, I think the.

**Speaker B** (16:18): High phosphate content relative.

**Speaker A** (16:20): Right.

**Speaker B** (16:21): The calcium is a big part of that. It wastes the energy. It's like a constant subliminal stimulus that tends to load the cells up with calcium as if they were fatigued already.

**Speaker A** (16:43): I mean, would you be supportive of a plant based protein diet over getting any kind of meats? Because I know you, you know, you're really, you stand very strongly behind gelatin and.

**Speaker B** (16:56): Well, the problem is that a lot of the plant based proteins are either overloaded with phosphate, the same as meat, or they have potential allergens and defensive molecules that the plants have that no animal has.

**Speaker A** (17:17): Right. So you still advocate very simple amino acid type, gelatin protein sources and then obviously things from dairy, cheese, milk and eggs as good quality, clean proteins.

**Speaker B** (17:30): Yeah, but it's a tremendously important field for research. To find what plants have the proper nutrients and don't have the toxins.

**Speaker A** (17:43): Right. Like you say, they're nearly always conjugated with the oils, liquid oils, or the polyunsaturates from the nuts. And. And yeah, then there's other sources, obviously tofu and soy. Soy protein has been implicated with having.

**Speaker B** (18:00): Kind of estrogenic effects as well as high phosphate.

**Speaker A** (18:03): Yeah. Okay. All right. So anyway, so getting back to. Getting back to what we were talking about with tryptophan and serotonin, I wanted to ask about. And this will be. This will branch out a little bit later into insulin resistance and cholesterol production. And yeah, kind of just go in a few different directions, but try and keep it as focused as possible. That superoxide dismutase, then this is an enzyme that degrades superoxide and superoxide sold as a health food supplement. And it's an extreme oxidant, correct?

**Speaker B** (18:47): Yes.

**Speaker A** (18:48): And so. And so very damaging. And I know last month I asked you just to break down the oxidation antioxidation kind of concept because we're bombarded with these. Obviously vitamin C is an antioxidant and we know vitamin C is very good, but there's also antioxidant effects that are not necessarily positive, correct?

**Speaker B** (19:11): Oh, oh, yeah. Too much of an antioxidant is typical cancer metabolism, for example.

**Speaker A** (19:20): Right, go on. Okay, so then that cancer metabolism is a lactic acid producing physiology as a byproduct. Okay. All right, so let's move on then to talk about proteins in terms of muscle building and that kind of thing. But most proteins contain tryptophan then, which is converted to serotonin. And do you think it's possible to contain enough non tryptophan containing proteins for continued muscle growth and repair?

**Speaker B** (19:57): All of the proteins other than gelatin that I know of will support proper growth and repair. Right.

**Speaker A** (20:06): Okay. All right, it's fairly straightforward then. All right. And then let's have a look here. I wanted to ask you about the ph of the blood and I know there are people, especially on the Internet, if you're looking for any kind of guidelines for health or health related topics. They'll talk about acidity and alkalinity and know the ph of the blood is kept very tightly between 7.35 and 7.45, I think. How much can this change? I mean, it's not really possible for that to change, is it?

**Speaker B** (20:43): Oh, yeah. I've seen very sick people with extremely high blood pH. 7.5 or 6, for example.

**Speaker A** (20:54): Really? Okay. It can Go outside that range. I thought the body did everything it can to keep it.

**Speaker B** (20:59): It does. A person has to get really safe for the blood to change outside that range.

**Speaker A** (21:06): Okay.

**Speaker B** (21:07): And you can do it momentarily just by hyperventilating, blowing, breathing so fast that your carbon dioxide is being lost. And that can push your blood PH very high to the point that you might faint or die. When you lose too much CO2, the increased pH tends to cause spasms, including blood vessel spasms, cutting off the circulation of your brain.

**Speaker A** (21:44): Could you do the opposite of that? Because I know you're an advocate of increasing CO2.

**Speaker B** (21:51): Yeah. Rebreathing in a paper bag, for example, you can correct that and lower the PH of your blood to the point that it can start weakening your muscles and causing too much vasodilation.

**Speaker A** (22:09): Right. So it is possible to go the other direction equally and oppositely.

**Speaker B** (22:13): Yeah. Muscle weakness is the worst thing that happens.

**Speaker A** (22:17): All right. There's nothing too much more serious than that, because I know some people were really, really getting into CO2 baths and rebreathing CO2 in a kind of.

**Speaker B** (22:28): Yeah. If you're just soaking it in through your skin, since you're breathing in the ordinary air, even though you're absorbing a really large amount of it through your skin, it's going to equalize with the air. And so you can't overdose sitting in pure CO2.

**Speaker A** (22:50): All right, can. I want to move on again, just to reiterate this for some people, perhaps, I'm not too sure the connection was made quite as clearly as this, but I was looking at. I was looking at some articles today, just going through some material to see what else could be fleshed out with this evening's talk carrying on from last month. But statins. I'm going to go on about statins again, but just to mention again that the brain actually creates its own cholesterol, and cholesterol systemically is too big a molecule to get across the blood brain barrier. And I know I asked you last month about the blood brain barrier and how physiologically intact it was, and I know that you mentioned several components that wouldn't typically get across. A blood brain barrier could, in certain instances, and I think a little bit like the intestinal barrier, fairly large fats.

**Speaker B** (23:51): Can massively go into the brain, escaping from the blood.

**Speaker A** (23:57): Interesting. Okay, so you say fat, some fairly large fats. But you don't think that cholesterol will pass the blood brain barrier, do you?

**Speaker B** (24:05): Yeah, I think it can, given the right.

**Speaker A** (24:09): Wow. Okay. Because what I wanted to say was that insofar as the literature is concerned, I'm not saying the literature has it right and you don't, but so far as the literature is concerned, that molecules they say is too big to get across the blood brain barrier and hence whatever the biological reason, for however long we've been around the brain, because it is such a both energy hungry organ and because the white matter of the brain is principally cholesterol, they say that 20% of the body's cholesterol is actually in the brain. And presumably because of the white matter and presumably because of the insulating effects of cholesterol on the neurons, and that the enzyme HMG CoA reductase produces cholesterol and that statins for those people, unfortunately who might be using them, but hopefully they'll look to an alternative if they don't completely ban them. But they probably won't because they're making too much money from it. The statins do pass and cross into the blood brain barrier.

**Speaker B** (25:18): So I imagine what they do to the brain is what they do to the muscles. And if you're soaked in statins and do vigorous exercise, the interference with cholesterol can cause your muscle to break down and simply dissolve and disintegrate. And I'm afraid that same thing can happen in the brain accounting for the depression, suicidality and such.

**Speaker A** (25:51): Right, because they're saying that these are some of the common side effects that they advertise as part of their disclaimer for the product. But just to bring out again from a kind of a simplistic, maybe mechanistic point, that the fact that you have this statin crossing into the brain and actually lowering your brain's brain's cholesterol is a definite reason, a cause for concern. Because typically if you had a low cholesterol situation, which was not actually, you know, due to just an inherently high genetic reason for producing cholesterol, that if you start lowering it systemically and this is crossing into your brain and your brain is suffering as a result of this, you're going to get some very, very odd neurological side effects of it.

**Speaker B** (26:43): Yeah, the old brain is sort of like a clump of atherosclerosis. It's got lots of cholesterol, but it's bound to fatty acids. And in the old brain, free cholesterol is actually lower than in the young brain. It's the bound up, interfering type of cholesterol that accumulates in the aged brain, as in the aged blood vessels.

**Speaker A** (27:15): But your brain is not like that, is it?

**Speaker B** (27:19): Avoiding vegetable oils a long time there you go.

**Speaker A** (27:24): Good.

**Speaker C** (27:25): All right.

**Speaker A** (27:25): You're listening to. I have no idea what time it is, but you're. Oh, okay. There you go. You're listening to Askurab, Dr. Kmud, Galville 91.1 FM. From now until 8:00 o', clock, you're invited to call in the questions. Dr. Raymond Pete is our guest. And the number, if you live in the areas, or if you. Even if you don't live out in the area, if you live anywhere on the planet. It's 707-923-3911. I looked at. Do we. You're counting. Okay. Just expecting the phone to start ringing. Okay. So I was looking at some, some articles this afternoon, and I saw an article about Hans Selju, which you mentioned quite a lot, saying that he was doing work on muscular dystrophy. And by administering serotonin to animals, this was caused. He actually could precipitate muscular dystrophy in animals.

**Speaker B** (28:20): Yeah. And that was in the late 50s and early 60s that he was doing those experiments. And despite that being in the literature in the 70s, tryptophan supplements became a popular fad and there was a lot of sickness produced by it. I think there were mental problems, but muscle inflammation and an immune system problem was the focus of the disease that became well known. And the FDA lightened it on a bad type of tryptophan, never explained, but Han Selyu was producing it with tryptophan simply in excess.

**Speaker A** (29:20): Okay. All right, we have a caller on the. On the line. So let's take this caller call away from. What's your question?

**Speaker D** (29:28): Hi, good evening. I'm calling from Santa Barbara, California.

**Speaker A** (29:31): Hi, welcome to the show.

**Speaker D** (29:33): Thank you. I just have a question. Are you familiar with the hair tissue mineral analysis test?

**Speaker A** (29:40): Yeah.

**Speaker D** (29:43): Okay, great. I just had some results of that. And my first question was is I have a very high sodium to potassium potassium ratio. My sodium is 34 and my potassium is 1. I just wanted to know what could be causing that and what do you do about it?

**Speaker B** (30:08): Was it a hair analysis?

**Speaker A** (30:09): Yeah.

**Speaker B** (30:11): It could be that you have hard water or have a water softener that puts sodium into the water. Yes.

**Speaker C** (30:20): Santa Barbara has water softeners in lots of the houses.

**Speaker A** (30:24): Do you have a water softener in your house?

**Speaker D** (30:27): Yes, I do.

**Speaker A** (30:28): Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B** (30:28): That puts sodium into the water and so it will skew the hair test.

**Speaker D** (30:34): Ah, okay. And then just one more on those. I have the ratio between the calcium and the potassium is very skewed as well. My calcium is 46 and the potassium is 1.

**Speaker B** (30:55): I'm not sure. That could be from hard water rather than softened water. But I wouldn't worry about a hair mineral test. A serum test is much more useful. Right.

**Speaker A** (31:10): Yeah. There you go. It's basically anything that you're exposed to, like Dr. Pete mentioned in the first instance here, if you're showering and your water's been softened that way, then that could easily explain how the hair would take up those components and would show to be high in one and low in another. But obviously, blood tests are the best way to do it. Okay. Did you have any particular reason for testing your hair, or was this just curiosity?

**Speaker D** (31:36): No. Yeah. I am working, like, with a functional nutritionist, and I've had the Dutch hormone testing done previously, and I've had some stool sampling done. And so as we progress, kind of trying to figure out the puzzle pieces of my symptoms, this was another. This test was recommended by her.

**Speaker A** (32:01): Yeah. Do you feel like you want to talk about what it was you were looking for help for?

**Speaker D** (32:07): Oh, sure. Yeah. Basically, a couple years ago, I started having symptoms of hypoglycemia, which I still have now.

**Speaker A** (32:18): And how old are you?

**Speaker D** (32:20): I'm 46.

**Speaker A** (32:21): Okay, good. Carry on. Sorry.

**Speaker D** (32:23): Yeah, so I've had that. I've had basically increased weight gain during these last couple years. I've gained probably about £40. I have changed my diet significantly. That was obviously a big problem for me. But my diet is very. I follow a lot of Dr. Pete's recommendations. My practitioner follows his work. So I've done a lot of those changes and everything. But basically I have, like, hypoglycemia. I have problems with anxiety. My inflammation marker is very high. And then, like I said, the weight gain and my hormones indicate I have high cortisol. So those are all kind of things that we've been trying to work on.

**Speaker A** (33:14): Okay. Dr. P. Hypoglycemia with high cortisol and.

**Speaker B** (33:19): Weight gain and anxiety.

**Speaker A** (33:20): And anxiety. Yeah.

**Speaker B** (33:22): Vitamin D and calcium and thyroid are likely involved.

**Speaker A** (33:28): Vitamin D, Calcium and thyroid. Have you had your vitamin D measured? Do you know what that is?

**Speaker D** (33:37): Yes, the most recent one I've had done. I want to say it was around 50ish.

**Speaker A** (33:44): Okay, that's good.

**Speaker B** (33:45): All right. And then the amount of calcium in your diet works with both thyroid and vitamin D to keep your metabolic rate up and your blood sugar steady.

**Speaker D** (34:01): Okay.

**Speaker B** (34:03): Two grams a day of calcium is a good level.

**Speaker A** (34:08): Do you drink any milk or do you take a calcium supplement or.

**Speaker D** (34:12): I don't take a calcium supplement, but I Do drink milk and I do eat high quality dairy.

**Speaker A** (34:18): How much milk do you drink?

**Speaker D** (34:23): Well, I've increased that per Dr. Pete. So I mean, for me, probably about 16 ounces and I'm drinking 2% milk.

**Speaker B** (34:32): Yeah, I think twice that much of 1% would be better. Two quarts of skimmed or 1% helps to lose weight because of the high calcium content.

**Speaker D** (34:49): And you said about like, what did you say on the ounces from one.

**Speaker B** (34:55): Quart to two quarts?

**Speaker D** (34:57): Oh, okay. One to two quarts of. Okay. Skimmers of 1%. Okay.

**Speaker B** (35:03): And that tends to increase your temperature. And if your temperature doesn't rise quickly in the morning when you get up and eat breakfast, if it doesn't get up to 98.6 by half hour after breakfast, then you're likely to need a thyroid supplement too.

**Speaker D** (35:27): Yeah, I do do the temperatures and pulses and I tend to have low temperatures. And then I did, I did try some nature throid, a very like the, like the lowest dosage. I forget the like quarter grain or something like that. But I started having more negative effects with it. I started having like, my anxiety was more increased and I sort of had been like more aggressive, like behavior, like a real short fuse and that kind of stuff. So I quit taking that after about a month.

**Speaker B** (36:10): One of the effects of thyroid is to make your cells able to retain the magnesium that they need. And if your diet doesn't have enough magnesium and two quarts of milk would give you a generous supply of magnesium, which would make the thyroid able to work more quickly. And the normal function of thyroid is to increase your ability to relax both muscles and nerves.

**Speaker D** (36:47): Okay. Okay. I appreciate your time. Thank you both so much.

**Speaker A** (36:52): Yeah, you're welcome. Okay, so people want to call in numbers. 707-923-3911. Dr. Raymond Pepys with us in the studio. Okay, so Dr. Pete, going back to the positive effects, and we've mentioned it's positive, it's only ever positive, but it's demonized in the industry in terms of treatments for lowering it. Cholesterol's effect is undoubtable in terms of regulating the system, regulating and supporting and stabilizing cells. Let me just. Okay, there's a caller on the line. Let's get this caller before we jump into this next question. Caller, you're on the airway from.

**Speaker E** (37:37): I'm from Mendocino County.

**Speaker A** (37:38): Okay. Hi. What's your question?

**Speaker E** (37:40): My question is I just recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and I was wondering an alternative way to treat that.

**Speaker A** (37:47): Yeah, how, how old are you?

**Speaker E** (37:49): 62.

**Speaker A** (37:50): 62. Okay. There's plenty of good, plenty of good ways to do this, but let Dr. Pete. Let Dr. Pete discuss it. Go ahead, Dr. Pete.

**Speaker B** (37:58): Okay. Keeping. Keeping the parathyroid hormone under control is essential. And eating a lot of calcium, like two quarts of milk, and keeping your vitamin D serum level up to the middle of the range, like 50 milligrams per milliliter, that is a good basis. But if your thyroid hormone is low, then your prolactin will likely be high enough that the prolactin itself has a bone weakening effect. Prolactin is normally the hormone of lactation, and it takes calcium out of the bone normally to put into milk, but under stress, it causes calcium to be lost from the bone. And prolactin tends to rise along with thyroid stimulating hormone. And the simplest way to normalize prolactin is to normalize your thyroid function. Keep your thyroid stimulating hormone at the lower end of the normal range.

**Speaker A** (39:29): Okay.

**Speaker E** (39:30): How do you keep the thyroid. How do you do that?

**Speaker B** (39:33): If you can't do it just with a selection of foods, then a supplement.

**Speaker E** (39:41): A thyroid supplement.

**Speaker B** (39:43): Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E** (39:45): And I do not like milk. So is there something else that I could do to get calcium?

**Speaker B** (39:52): Oh, well, cooked greens are the food that's richest other than milk in calcium relative to phosphate. But if you grind up eggshells, that's a good pure form of calcium carbonate, which is next best to milk.

**Speaker E** (40:15): Okay. How many ground up egg sales do you do per day?

**Speaker B** (40:20): Oh, a couple of grams would be good.

**Speaker E** (40:23): Okay.

**Speaker A** (40:24): All right. Yeah. So you can just use your eggs. If you use eggs, you can just put them to one side and gently wash out the membrane and stack them up for a week or so. And then after a week, you can put them on a baking tray and put them in the oven at about 150 and basically sterilize them that way and then put them in a coffee grinder and then they'll grind up very finely into a fine powder. Do have some people who use these kind of approaches to calcium rather than pills and capsules that do say that best taken with food, it can irritate some people's stomachs, but it's a very clean way, especially if we're using organic eggs to get a good quality calcium carbonate. And it's almost all calcium. So 2,000 milligrams a day is what Dr. P said. So two grams, it's about. It's about 318 teaspoons, I think. I think an eighth teaspoon is 650 odd milligrams.

**Speaker C** (41:18): Okay?

**Speaker A** (41:19): Yeah. So if you don't drink milk or eat cheese or get lots of cooked greens and you are calcium, calcium lean, then that's obviously going to work against you. But can I quickly ask you what kind of menstrual history you had?

**Speaker E** (41:35): I had, I went through menopause at early age at 45.

**Speaker A** (41:38): 45, yeah. All right. I just, I've just spoken to a lot of women who have either had hysterectomies and very poor hormone replacement approaches done or have had really bad menstrual cycles and been very high estrogen. And a lot of these women show very early osteopenia in their 40s and then osteo bordering osteoporotic by 50. It's not what you want. You really want to address this. And vitamin D and calcium and thyroid are going to be the best, least invasive and certainly most tolerable approach to dealing with your osteoporosis because you're only young and, you know, hopefully you're going to live quite a while longer and it's going to, it's not going to get any better if you don't address it unopposed.

**Speaker B** (42:24): Cortisol is another bone dissolving hormone.

**Speaker D** (42:28): What is that?

**Speaker B** (42:29): Cortisol, if it's even in the higher part of the normal range in a morning test, if it isn't balanced with the adrenal DHEA and progesterone and other adrenal steroids that can contribute to osteoporosis and supplementing progesterone and DHEA and or pregnenolone can oppose that effect of cortisol.

**Speaker E** (43:05): Okay. All right, thank you very much, Dr. Pete.

**Speaker A** (43:09): Okay, good. So the number, if you live anywhere on the planet and you'd like to ask Dr. Pete a question during this evening's call ending at 8:00 clock here, it's 7079-233917-07923-3911. So, Dr. Pete, just getting back to cholesterol for a little bit in terms of what has been so popularized and so treated with statins. Cholesterol's positive effects, I think are just beginning to come to pass. And I think it's a little bit like a sea change that's occurred with the whole perpetration of polyunsaturated supposedly being good for you and saturated fats being bad for you, which is I think now at last finally seeing the light of day. And I'm reading reports on the Internet. I'm not saying the Internet is the only sole source of any information, but seeing some good articles coming out about how that is just so. And I know you've been talking about it for 40 years or more and I'm sorry that it's taken so long for everybody, you know, including us 10 years ago, we're still thinking that's the way it was. But I'm also starting to see some good articles that have been written expounding the benefits of cholesterol and just outlining in very plain, simple, layman terms just how beneficial cholesterol is and why it's so important and that the whole LDL HDL thing is a complete myth. And there are actually a lot more studies showing that some of these oxidized LDL particles are probably more responsible for the inflammatory initial insult on the endothelia of the vessels that then causes cholesterol to be laid down as a repair mechanism, which during dissection of a cadaver who's died of a heart attack, for example, they'll say, oh, that's it, here's the cholesterol. It's blocked the arteries. That's why he's dead. When actually all the time. You've always said it's the initial insult from things like lipifushkin or other oxidative byproducts of lipid metabolism that have caused initial insult. But in terms of the brain, and the brain's functioning so cholesterol, I can't really state it enough just how important it is to have adequate cholesterol. And that low cholesterol is virtually unspoken about people. You can find it very hard to find any information regarding low cholesterol because no one's looking that way. And I wonder just how many people actually present with a blood test and their doctor's saying, oh, your cholesterol is great. You know, whenever I've had blood work done and my cholesterol is pretty 120 at the moment, it's always, wow, your cholesterol is great. And I'm thinking, no, it's not. It's nowhere near high enough, you know. And I know you've always said that you should be about 200. So a cholesterol of 120 is obviously not good for me. But yeah, it's not at all influenced by diet. And in terms of your body will make cholesterol out of just about anything. Yeah. Okay, there's a caller on the air. Let's get this caller. Hi, Corly. Yeah. Where are you from?

**Speaker B** (46:12): My name is John and I'm 78. Over the last year, or maybe a little more, I guess my PSA has gone up okay. Precipitously. Yeah. From 4 to 5 to 20.

**Speaker A** (46:29): Okay.

**Speaker B** (46:30): And I wonder if there's any supplements that can help me drive that down.

**Speaker A** (46:34): Yeah. Dr. P is probably not in isolation, but this person's PSA is 20. Now.

**Speaker B** (46:44): I think everything anti inflammatory is the right approach. A diet low in phosphate is a very basic anti inflammatory thing. And so I'm going to hang up the cooked greens, cheese, milk and eggs are anti inflammatory foods, keeping your thyroid function up so that your liver is helping to balance your hormones, keeping estrogen down. Adequate protein, a good calcium phosphate ratio and fairly high normal body temperature is important to lower inflammation and to keep the ratio of estrogen low.

**Speaker A** (47:57): Do you think, Dr. Pete, from an herbal medicine perspective, the kind of rationale of using aromatase inhibitors from things like nettle root or using the sterols, pardon me, from saw palmetto, might be anti estrogenic and that's how that could be rational for treating prostatic hypertrophy. Do you think prostatic hypertrophy is down to estrogens as much as anything else?

**Speaker B** (48:24): Yeah. Estrogen is a growth and carcinogenic factor in the prostate.

**Speaker A** (48:34): As men get older, their estrogen no doubt rises, especially as testosterone is on the decline.

**Speaker B** (48:39): Yeah. And the men who live the longest with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone.

**Speaker A** (48:46): What? The men that live the longest with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone.

**Speaker B** (48:53): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (48:53): So in that. Okay. Yeah. So that the testosterone in that point then is kind of protective, huh?

**Speaker B** (49:00): Yeah. And in the early 90s, when they started using the PSA test as a diagnosis of prostate cancer, the mortality from prostate cancer took a huge surge upward. And some of the doctors noticed that and decided maybe it wasn't a good idea to diagnose prostate cancer.

**Speaker A** (49:27): Right. Because a lot of the times you have said this quite a few times before now, but a lot of the times it can. I'm not advocating people just don't do anything about a supposed cancer marker that is, you know, possibly treatable, especially from a medical perspective. But you've mentioned quite a few times that people found in the mortuary, they've died from some other cause and they've been found with a wide range of different cancers that hasn't been the thing that's killed them, or they've been found with prostate enlargement and. Or a benign type dysplastic prostatic inflammation.

**Speaker B** (50:02): A couple studies found that 100% of people who died at the age of 50 or more. All of them had diagnosable cancer somehow.

**Speaker A** (50:14): Yeah, yeah. So the call, the best thing, the best things for you. Talking about what Dr. Pete's been mentioning, if you can obviously maintain physical activity in terms of keeping a testosterone as high as you can from being a male, that's certainly very protective and anti estrogenic, estrogen being one of those hormones that rises in males, especially in males that are obese or, you know, they have more fat than is good for them, especially because that tissue tends to accumulate and or produce estrogen in its own right. And then there are two herbs that I. There's more than that, but the two that come to mind instantly are things like nettle root as an aromatase inhibitor and that has an effect blocking estrogen. And then the saw palmetto extract. But there's lots of information about alternative medicines for enlarged prostate. But I think obviously keeping an eye on your PSA in conjunction with using some of those herbs that have been used for prostatic enlargement and making sure that your estrogen is being opposed by testosterone and getting exercise and aspirin is a neuromax. There you go. And aspirin is certainly something that's very well tolerated, very inexpensive and very easily to get hold of. Okay, we do have one more caller on the air, so let's get this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

**Speaker E** (51:43): I'm in Humboldt in Redway. Okay, my question is how can I get off Celexa?

**Speaker A** (51:50): Okay. We had a very similar question last month about lady who called, called in on SSRIs and wanted help with that. So in terms of dose, have you ever tried reducing the dose of this and then slowly withdrawing from it?

**Speaker E** (52:12): I would be willing to try that, yeah.

**Speaker A** (52:16): It's one. I mean, Dr. P, in terms of withdrawal, we talked about this last month. So in terms of withdrawing from an SSRI is not to be done unsupported. But you mentioned last month that there's plenty to do in terms of supporting the physiology with thyroid with other positive lifestyle diet changes that basically will allow a person to slowly taper off of an SSRI and not be. Not be basically overloaded with this product, serotonin.

**Speaker B** (52:51): One of their effects tends to increase the stress hormones. And so an anti stress program. I've known people to withdraw from several different addictive things including the SSRIs using progesterone and coffee and thyroid and a good high calcium diet, for example.

**Speaker A** (53:20): How long have you been using it?

**Speaker B** (53:22): For many years.

**Speaker A** (53:24): Yeah, yeah. I mean obviously it's, it's unfortunate we're getting so close to the top of the hour and the end of the show, but in terms of its use for the treatment of anxiety and depression, etc. Etc. And all the label recommendations, recommendations that are given for prescribing it in the first place, in terms of your headspace and where you are and what you're engaged with, what stimulates you or what, or what, you know, upsets you even, there's certainly scope there for lifestyle changes. But as Dr. Peets mentioned, you know, in terms of anti stress things, there are certainly components of that in your diet are anti stress and that support your thyroid and are anti inflammatory and decrease the quote unquote stress which is on, you know.

**Speaker D** (54:18): Like lifestyle changes that.

**Speaker E** (54:20): Like go out and run or walk every day.

**Speaker A** (54:23): No, we're not running for sure. But in terms of gentle weight bearing exercise and walking and breathing and being in the sunlight, you know, or in a bright room, making sure you've got exposure to that good red light, etc. Etc. Especially in the winter now we're coming with long day, long nights and short days and the whole seasonal affective disorder being a fairly widespread thing in this part of the world. As thyroid gets low, as the winter's coming, this thyroid hormone, and then there's opposing your estrogen as a female which undoubtedly will have a beneficial effect.

**Speaker B** (54:54): Men keeping up with vitamin D. Yeah, hormone replacement therapy.

**Speaker A** (55:01): No, not a big advocate of hormone replacement therapy. Well, the only hormone would be progesterone to oppose your estrogen. But if you're on any kind of hormone replacement that's estrogen based, then you really don't want to be doing that. It's, it's completely not what you're going to hear from your doctor. Perhaps, you know, or maybe some naturopath who's a little more current. Yeah, I don't even have a clock in front of me. What, what time is it, Michael? I guess it's that time, I'm afraid.

**Speaker C** (55:32): We've got gentle music where you wrap up. Yeah, I mean, you've got a minute to say goodbye to Dr. Pete.

**Speaker A** (55:37): All right, thank you so much, Dr. Pete, for joining us.

**Speaker B** (55:39): Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A** (55:40): Okay, if, if that lady wants to contact us any, anytime afterwards, basically you can just email me. My email address is andrewesternbotanicalmedicine.com so yeah, go ahead and email me. I'll respond to your email next week when I get back in the office on Monday. Okay, so for those who've listened, thanks for joining in the show. Same third Friday of next month, December. And for those people who've listened to Dr. Pete, want to find out more about him. Www.ray Pete.com Got plenty of well written articles that fully backed up by studies that you can just go ahead and look at on the Internet. So people want alternatives. They want some hope. Definitely a good thing to have and very positive. There's lots of alternatives, so don't have to be forced down one particular way to do something. Anyway, until next month. Oh, I just wanted to mention that in January. So Sarah will be back. So for all those people, all those people who keep saying, where's Sarah? Where's Sarah? Anyway, thanks so much for joining. Until next month.
