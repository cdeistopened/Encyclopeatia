## Transcript

**Speaker A** (00:00): Well, welcome to this month's ask your herb doctor. The third Friday of the month. And every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm the program runs and we have a live show where we take callers from 7:30 until 8:00 clock, inviting them to call in with questions either related or sometimes unrelated to the topic of the month's subject. This month we're going to be discussing skin cancers amongst a few other things, and treatment approaches and or prevention strategies. The number, if you live in the area or indeed if you live outside the area or you're from Australia or somewhere like that, is 707-923-3911. These programs are also archived on the web at www.kmud.org under the Audio archives tab. People want to scroll down to Friday night talk, choose the third Friday of each month. They keep them for about two months. And fortunately most of these shows have been put up by several individuals on YouTube. So the YouTube channels also cover most of the shows that we've done. And our website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com also has a link in the resources tab. And every show that we've done bar the last few months of this year up there and free to download. And we do get calls and emails from people telling us how much they've enjoyed them and they've just come upon them and they've never heard anything like it. So that's, that's why we do this as an alternative approach. I graduated with a degree in herbal medicine in England in 1999, have been practicing ever since. And we run a business where we produce alternative supplements, dietary supplements to promote and support well being We've had on the show Dr. Raymond Pete with us for a number of years now. I think I last counted it was getting on close to 10. And always very pleased to have his wisdom on the show because he comes from a different era, not just from, from his age, but also from the way things were understood back then and before the financial interests steamrolled the way they do now. So Dr. Raymond Peet is on the show to join us this evening. And are you there, Dr. Pete yes, hello. Well, thanks so much as always for giving your time as freely as you always do every third Friday of the month on the show. For those people who perhaps have never heard you or never read your work, would you give an outline of your academic and your professional background so that people know where you, where you come from?

**Speaker B** (02:57): I graduated from Southern Oregon College 1956 with a Bachelor's degree majoring in humanities and then went to the University of Oregon for a master's degree, got that, and taught for several years linguistics and other subjects. And then 1968 went back to the University of Oregon in biology for a Ph.D. 1972.

**Speaker A** (03:25): And you've been working ever since then. And you do your own independent research and you always, always come up with at least a handful of people, published people and other authors that show work that you probably wouldn't find too much evidence of now unless you were really digging for it deeply. And indeed you spen you have spent and you still spend a lot of your a lot of your time.

**Speaker B** (03:53): I actually started reading old medical textbooks in the 1940s.

**Speaker A** (04:00): In libraries, folks.

**Speaker B** (04:02): I found that there was more interesting stuff in the old books than they were teaching in college. That's why I studied humanities rather than sciences the first.

**Speaker A** (04:15): And you've been applying your rationale to people when they approach you asking what would you do if such and such were happening? And you've been doing this now for how many? 30, 40 years?

**Speaker B** (04:28): At least 45.

**Speaker A** (04:29): At least 45. All right, well good. So without much further ado, just want to remind people that is a live call in show. People do call in from California all over the states and indeed from abroad. And the area code here is 70793911 and incidentally we can be reached at the end of the business end of the show during normal business hours. 1 888WBM Erb so there's a lot of ongoing debate between pro UV exposure groups and the COVID up anti UV camps. On the one hand, solar UV radiation represents the most significant environmental risk factor for the development of non melanoma skin cancer. Consequently, protection from this is an important approach, especially in risk groups. 90% of all vitamin D in the body has to be formed in the skin through the action of UV radiation. And the dilemma is the undeniable association between vitamin D deficiency and a host of pathologies ranging from various cancers like colon, prostate and breast cancer, which have been confirmed in a large number of studies, as well as bone diseases, autoimmune diseases, infectious and cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. So vitamin D's benefit is pretty unquestionable at this point. So strict sun protection causes vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. And the idea that sunlight and vitamin D inhibit the growth of human cancers is not new. So looking at the radiation from the.

**Speaker C** (06:09): Sun.

**Speaker A** (06:12): The main two groups are UVA and B, with the ozone layer taking out all of the uvc. So Both. Both cause damage. Now, the UVB causes a rearrangement of DNA, producing what they call photo products, which are known mutagens, causing cancer. And then UVA in its own right, causes damage via oxidative type processes. And the suppression of a skin's immune system has been shown to represent another mechanism by which solar radiation induces and promotes skin cancer growth. So I think, just to start, I know mentioned that immunosuppressive properties have been demonstrated for both UVA and B. But I think just to go over what we've already mentioned that topic, cholesterol extensively. And hopefully people are beginning to get the message that cholesterol is actually not a villain. It's actually very important. And everything that they want, for want of a better word, the industry does to control cholesterol in patients that have, quote, unquote, high cholesterol, which you've already mentioned for anybody over 50 wants to be at least 200 milligram percent. And most people that are showing, you know, a cholesterol of 200 or slightly above, get put on statins. And we'll talk about statins in a bit because there's even more evidence to suggest that they are very harmful. And actually they do a lot more harm than any good that they've purportedly done, apart from increasing the profits of the companies that produce them. So can you speak a little bit of the effect of skin cholesterol on the conversion by ultraviolet light, the conversion of cholesterol to vitamin D and a difference between a young person's skin and an aging person's skin? Because I think if you mentioned that the cholesterol content is a very important factor which is decreased in the elderly.

**Speaker B** (08:09): Yeah, they've known for several years that over the age of 60 or 70, it takes about twice as much sunlight exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D. And it turns out that that's simply because old skin has only about half as much cholesterol as young skin. And that is not confined to the skin. The age effect occurs in the adrenal glands, for example, which are the largest producers of not only steroid hormones, but of cholesterol itself. The digestive system, the intestine and liver, are important sources of cholesterol. The brain and skin produce usually most of the cholesterol that they need. But all of those organs, the machinery for producing cholesterol, declines with aging roughly 50% by old age. And in the skin, it becomes obvious that the vitamin D isn't produced in the sunlight, but every organ the cholesterol has many functions. The brain produces steroids from cholesterol the same way the gonads and adrenal glands do. The skin can produce steroid hormones from cholesterol. And any injury to the skin, even intense blue light or injecting irritating substances, will cause the skin to defensively increase the production of both cholesterol and the vitamin D derived from it to the extent that it can, according to its age and health.

**Speaker A** (10:21): Is this, Can I just interrupt for a second? Is this the mechanism by which you've mentioned in the past that the polyunsaturates and lipid byproducts, lipofuschkin in particular, being so oxidative damage, the endothelial and the body then produces a cholesterol to repair that damage. And that actually is not a problem with cholesterol being found in blockage, but it's actually the underlying insult. But the cholesterol is an immediate response to that stress.

**Speaker B** (10:53): Once the oxidative damage occurs, that damage is enough to rouse the system to produce vitamin D and cholesterol. But the polyunsaturated fat, its direct action on the cholesterol enzyme hmg, COA reductase, it inhibits the production where the saturated fats don't inhibit cholesterol production. So if you're going to use any oil on the skin, it should be cocoa butter or cow butter or anything highly saturated and not any of the PUFA seedlings.

**Speaker D** (11:39): Right.

**Speaker A** (11:40): You've mentioned this a lot of times now. So people out there that are using creams especially for things, you know, like rejuvenating creams or anti aging or wrinkle creams or, you know, creams that are supposedly plumping up the epidermis and returning that youthful look should definitely not be based on polyunsaturates.

**Speaker B** (12:01): Yeah, there were experiments about 30, 40 years ago on rabbits. They shaved their backs so that they were exposed to ultraviolet sunlight. And the rabbits that were fed polyunsaturated fats developed quickly wrinkled, aged skin on their backs. And the ones with the saturated diet didn't have have that sun damage. So the polyunsaturated the double bonds are especially reactive to ultraviolet light. But even through indirect pathways, even blue light can activate the lipid peroxidation process. For example, vitamin B2, yellow vitamin, absorbs blue light and is excited chemically and it becomes reactive. Either the ultraviolet or blue light will create a vitamin deficiency, in effect impairing the ability of the cell to produce energy oxidatively. And that leads to the production of lactic acid, which Creates inflammation.

**Speaker A** (13:20): Right.

**Speaker B** (13:21): So even blue light can lead to a fatigued process of the cell leading to inflammation and degeneration.

**Speaker A** (13:30): And this is via polyunsaturates. And this is why you advocate eliminating polyunsaturates from your diet and just switching it all out to saturated sources and that over time you will change the mass of your fat content to saturated from polyunsaturated. Even though we do produce some polyunsaturates ourself.

**Speaker B** (13:52): And it's coming to be recognized that stearic acid, purely saturated fatty acid has anti cancer effects.

**Speaker A** (14:02): Yeah. It's just a matter of time hopefully. Right. Okay. So you said that in an older person, just to recap here, that an elderly person has 50% less cholesterol in their skin and that they need twice the sunlight exposure to create the same amount of vitamin D. So obviously that's a big concern for and I know people, when they talk about people in nursing homes, we generally think about people that are well advanced. But besides the fact that they're not producing enough vitamin D, being indoors in a nursing home and not getting sunlight, it further compounds their chances of becoming susceptible to cancers as vitamin D has been shown repeatedly to be a good strategy for protecting against cancers. And I know you've just a couple.

**Speaker B** (14:53): Years ago there were experiments on hairless mice exposing them to ultraviolet light and then giving them topical vitamin D. Topical vitamin D and preventing the UV carcinogenesis by treating them after the exposure with vitamin D. Yeah.

**Speaker A** (15:18): Good. Interesting. Okay. You're listening to Ask your doctor on KMUD galbable 91.1 FM and from 7:30 to the end of the show, you're invited to call him with questions related to this month's topic of basically skin cancers, vitamin D and cholesterol and how they're how we're going to explain here how they are all pulled in to produce a rationale for supporting good health. The number if you live in the area 707-923-3911 well Dr. Pete, you've already touched on it lightly here without me asking you, but I looked at while I was doing some background reading for this month's show here, I looked at the mevalonate pathway. Now you mentioned HMG CoA REDUCTASE as an enzyme without explaining all the step by step formation of steroids and cholesterol from acetyl CoA, which is a natural process and one that's extremely important for us. You mentioned the enzyme. Now statins, just to try and bring this around back to a point of people can help cement the idea in their mind that cholesterol is not a bad molecule. This malavonate pathway and the production of cholesterol, amongst many other compounds, including steroids, carotenoids, saponins, limonoids, etc. They're blocked by statins at this particular point in the pathway. So another reason to avoid statins, and I know you've said many times, and I'll repeat it again, because there's going to be people that have probably just heard this for the first time, but if you're over 50, you actually want a cholesterol more like 200, 210, 220. It's actually protective. But if you're taking statins to lower your cholesterol because it's supposedly too high and not, not good for you, which we've shown time and time again is actually bad science, using statins and blocking this enzyme will lead to a deficit in all those other steroids and all the other products from which cholesterol is a building block.

**Speaker B** (17:31): It's now gradually being realized that ubiquinone, or coenzyme Q10, which is a product of that same enzyme, that the statins lower that. And it's an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory system. And when a tissue is stressed, such as a muscle during exercise, the mitochondria fails to produce enough energy and that can lead to the breakdown of the muscle. And sometimes the muscle breakdown plugs up the kidneys, in effect, and kills the person. But very commonly it's causing muscle pain made worse by exercise. And that's because of damage to the mitochondrial respiratory system mainly. Although the structural effects of reduced cholesterol will affect the structure and function of mitochondria. But since the brain and other organs use the same coenzyme Q10 and mitochondrial processes, the muscle damage is just a very noticeable thing. Where the cognitive damage is less noticeable.

**Speaker A** (18:50): Yeah, more cumulative. You mentioned lactic acid, obviously being a byproduct here and being very inflammatory. Is that apart from this CoQ 10 decrease, or is it in conjunction with.

**Speaker B** (19:05): That, it is unnecessary adaptation to anything that impairs oxidation.

**Speaker A** (19:11): Okay, so do you. Do you see any of the other steroid hormones or like I mentioned, the carotenoids or saponins even, or the limonoids, part of the isoprenoid formation of essentially what we would term components, like you would find in essential oils, the terpenes and terpenoids. Is there anything there that you would see that would be.

**Speaker B** (19:38): I suspect that even body odor will be affected by it, because it's known that some of these perfumey chemicals made by that pathway are involved in the fragrance of a young person's in oils. And so I imagine it would tend to make a person lose less perfume fragrance.

**Speaker A** (20:04): Interesting. Okay. All right, so I know that's a serious, from a health perspective, but it's an interesting, interesting take on it. Just an aside, what do you, what do you see as a, a direct link, if you like, by the way you understand it. I mean, some people just don't smell good. Okay. Some people, you don't smell them. They have no smell and you know, they don't have to bath for two days, three days a week, you know, and they don't smell. Other people, you know, have to bathe every day and you smell them and they smell bad.

**Speaker B** (20:38): Alexander the Great, who apparently had great vitality in general, Right. He was famous. Historians wrote about how sweet he smelled. Wow. People would collect his used garments because they had a permanent perfume infused into them. Everyone under stress can emit different chemicals. For example, isoprene tends to show up during nighttime stress.

**Speaker A** (21:05): Oh, really? Okay. All right. So how else do you see body odor, I mean, apart from the kind of medical definitions of, you know, just bacterial breakdown, yeast and, you know, byproducts of that kind of thing in a.

**Speaker B** (21:23): Healthy person, the skin under the influence of thyroid hormone and feedback from the progesterone, which is produced in the skin from the cholesterol, insulin and thyroid hormone are very important for keeping the flow going from energy through cholesterol into the steroids. And then those steroids include, among some of the minor androgens, the pheromones, the sex attracting steroids, both in men and women, Some of the testosterone related minor androgens create a perfume that is very closely associated with, with high production of the steroids.

**Speaker A** (22:18): Okay, so you call it perfume. Would you, would you also describe it as a musk or a disagreeable smell, though? I mean, presumably attraction should be, you know, preceded by something pleasant. Right. Rather than.

**Speaker B** (22:34): Yeah, many, many people aren't aware of smells, but experiments show that they're influenced in their judgment about a person by the smells on their skin.

**Speaker A** (22:49): Interesting. Well, I'm only saying this because I come from a perspective of still somewhat kind of medically brainwashed. But in terms of the liver and its process for deaminating and breaking down toxins and making them ready for excretion because we don't want, want them building up because they're toxins. Is there any link, any link perhaps to liver dysfunction and.

**Speaker B** (23:18): Oh yeah, yeah, the. When the liver is failing, the fats that should be breaking down and excreting can come out in the breath.

**Speaker A** (23:31): On the breath. Okay. Yeah, but how about in ungeneralized body odor?

**Speaker B** (23:34): Oh, oh, yeah. Acutely, they show up in the breath. Just for example, when you get hungry. If your liver isn't efficient, things in your tissues will come out in your exhaled breath, but chronically they accumulate and come out more gradually in the skin oils.

**Speaker A** (23:55): That's funny, we call this. Excuse me, we call this death breath. And you find it on children too. And in fact, our five year old, you know, if we haven't made sure that she's. Because she's so active, I mean she's very. She's bright, she's intelligent, she's fast. I think she burns a lot of calories. And if we don't constantly feed her, then the day before, the evening before, she'll wake up in the morning and she'll have this smell on her that's obviously one the process by which you've described. And she doesn't have it when we're really conscious about making sure she gets plenty of sugars during that day. And in the evening she has a sugary snack and then she's totally fine. You don't smell it. It's night and day.

**Speaker B** (24:38): Yeah, that. That smell can precede, for example, an epileptic seizure or just other like migraine headache. Anything that. Where the blood sugar is inadequate and the stress hormones break down tissues.

**Speaker A** (24:57): Yeah, okay, Interesting. All right, well, it's. It's 7:26 and the phone lines have been ringing here. We do have a. I've been told we do have a couple of people ready to step in. So let's just take this. We've got plenty more things I want to ask you about, but let's. I know that the show really is about exposing you and I like it when people call up and they ask you stuff and they challenge you to think about the way you think about it. So let's take this first. Call a caller.

**Speaker E** (25:22): Hi, my name is Chris and I'm calling from Southern Humboldt. And the first thing I want to add to your little discussion here about fragrances. I had a friend who was a monk and he was a Tibetan monk, but he was actually English and he was quite cultivated. And anyway, he was eating.

**Speaker B** (25:42): I'm trying.

**Speaker E** (25:42): To think rose petals.

**Speaker A** (25:44): Okay.

**Speaker E** (25:45): And he smelled wonderful. I mean, he was probably like Alexander. So maybe that was the secret. But what I wanted to talk to you about, Dr. Pete, was I Don't know if you remember me or not. I know you talk to a lot of people, but I talked to you, I inquired with you about Monk Fruit sugar. You remember?

**Speaker B** (26:04): Oh, yeah.

**Speaker A** (26:04): Okay.

**Speaker E** (26:05): Well, I've done a lot of research on it so far and I'm even trying to get the local community college to possibly start to grow Monk Fruit sugar as a research product. But anyway, the wonderful thing about the Monk Fruit sugar is in China, it's the reason Chinese people don't get fat, because they don't eat table sugar like wheat, they don't eat cane sugar. They're eating Monk Fruit sugar exclusively. And believe it or not, they've been using it for as long as there's been Chinese people on the planet.

**Speaker B** (26:35): I don't know how long that's been.

**Speaker E** (26:36): But they've used it for controlling diabetes. In fact, it's absolutely wonderful for that. And I've done some research for you guys. The reduction of the inflammation and oxidation. If Monk fruit is administered regularly, like half a teaspoon every day, you will reduce or eliminate inflammation and oxidation entirely? Absolutely.

**Speaker A** (27:05): Well, Dr. Pete, obviously both you and I and lots of people that we consult with and do the same thing are big advocates of regular white table sugar. What do you, what do you have to say about Monk Fruit Sugar and how would you see this being a positive anti kind of diabetes type?

**Speaker B** (27:28): I actually think any sugar, but especially fruit sugar and any sugar is a good treatment for diabetes because glucose is a promoter of stem cell renewal in the pancreas and it opposes, tends to suppress the free fatty acids which are produced under stress. And the free fatty acids are constantly killing the beta cells in the pancreas every time they regenerate under the influence of glucose. If there isn't enough glucose to suppress the free fatty acids, then regenerated beta cells get killed again. So keeping the fatty acids down is the essence of curing diabetes. And any kind of fruit, if you eat enough of it, please inquire and.

**Speaker E** (28:28): Ask you, I beseech you, please look into. It's called Luhan Go. It's L U O H A N G U O. That's its Mandarin name in China. And Lu Hangou is Monk Fruit. Please do some research on this because I really think it's going to help a lot of people that have diabetes and I, I think it's really going to help a lot of people that have problems with chronic inflammation. And that's all I have to say. Have a great night.

**Speaker A** (28:55): Okay, thank you for your call, engineer. You said that I just did a.

**Speaker F** (29:01): Really quick little research and There is about 35% fructose and sucrose in it, but there's actually a chemical they're calling. It's a triterpene glycoside, a saponin tripyrutipine glycoside that gives a little, a lot of the fruit, the sweetness, and that's a powder they extract and concentrate. So I suspect it's more like stevia than an actual.

**Speaker A** (29:24): So. So, Dr. Pete, knowing what you know, if you've looked at Monk Fruit sugar, do you have anything else to say about it as a substance and, or, and, or a direct comparison to glucose or sucrose or fructose?

**Speaker B** (29:37): Obviously, no, I haven't seen any comparisons of it.

**Speaker A** (29:41): Okay.

**Speaker B** (29:42): In diabetes, yeah.

**Speaker A** (29:43): Well, no problem. Okay, well, we have another caller on the, on the air. So, caller, you're on the air. Where you from and what's your question?

**Speaker D** (29:50): I'm from New York, Dr. Pete. We spoke before as well as a prior caller. And it's consistent, following up on a recommendation you mentioned. But it's consistent what you were talking about with vitamin D. I had a skin rash and I had been prescribed cortisol creams and all kinds of stuff with lots of side effects, decided not to do that. I asked you about it and you had recommended salt and baking soda bath like a pound each daily. And I think you also mentioned vitamin D. In addition to that, I did take a high volume, like 50 billion units of not just acidophilus, but a mixed variety of probiotics, those types of products, and it got better, but it took like five months. It is coming back now. You also had mentioned very minor way. And so I have two questions about that. One, you'd mentioned vitamin D as well, and not so much vitamin A. I did get a vitamin D test and it was 39, which, it's not dangerous, but is low. And I am, I am older, over 60. So I was just wondering what is it that I could do to get that vitamin D level up, even though I am applying it topically, sun doesn't seem to work. And trying to overcome the points you made at the outset of this particular show. That's the first part. The second part is when they gave me cortisol. I was thinking the adrenal glands make cortisol.

**Speaker G** (31:23): Right.

**Speaker D** (31:23): So if you get older and your adrenal glands are less efficient for the reasons you mentioned earlier, is that why they're suggesting topical cortisol? Because you can't make enough yourself and if that's the case, it seems to me you would want to take adrenal hormones to more rejuvenate your adrenal glands so that you can make your own cortisol and let your body decide how much to make and where to repair. So it's the vitamin D in the adrenal glands. It did heal, took a very long time, but it is actually coming back now. So I'm wondering about those two points.

**Speaker B** (31:56): Have you tried any supplements like DHEA or progesterone or pregnenolone?

**Speaker D** (32:03): Well, you know, I took pregnenolone and it actually is great, but I just. I don't know. I don't know whether it affects my body's ability to produce it, but I feel. Obviously you feel great right away. You've mentioned that in the past. But I just don't know how it dynamically affects other hormones, whether or not it's actually making testosterone or converting to estrogen. Because I do run a little bit. And frankly, I did run today. It's funny you mentioned this also about the damage you can do by running. And afterward I did actually take some CoQ10, coincidentally. I don't know why I did it, but then have you say it and I thought, wow, that's interesting that you said that. Maybe that's a good idea if you're going to run, even if just a little bit, just to keep the blood flowing. Taking CoQ10 seems to make sense as sort of a defensive measure because there are some benefits of running, which I know you don't espouse, but it's important for me, and obviously you want to do it in a way that reduces the damage. But I have taken it. I do have topical progesterone. Being a man, I don't do a lot of it. And I have dhea and I've taken that a little bit. But again, I'm just not sure how to take them, in what quantity, how often and how they would interact with what my body's trying to do. So I kind of have them, but I'm not actually sure how to use them, to be honest.

**Speaker B** (33:31): Have you checked your thyroid function?

**Speaker D** (33:34): Well, I do take 30 milligrams of the thyroid, but I do the natural desiccated for the same reasons I just mentioned. It does have some liver in it, so I don't know if that's a problem. But I do take it. And my temperature was great during the summer. I know you've mentioned this before. I mean, it was much better. Now it's actually A little bit lower. I'm finding it in the morning in the low 97s. So I try to get to 97.6 or 7 or 8 in the morning, but I'm a little bit. About a half a degree lower than that. So, you know, I could increase it, but I don't. You know, you're not depressed, your energy's not lower, and I can get my energy up. The red light helps dry. CO2 is phenomenal. But, yeah, I think I have. I definitely have a weaker thyroid and probably running hurts it. Other things hurt it, but I try to stick to your diet to minimize the risk. Carrots hurt it, too, by the way.

**Speaker G** (34:29): I think I.

**Speaker D** (34:30): My blood sugar drops when I take that carrot. It may help my stomach, but it hurts my. I think it hurts my thyroid function, but it goes away. It goes away. So the answer is, yes, I do take a little bit of thyroid, but only 30 milligrams or one grain. I could up it to two, but question is, when do you take that during the day? Do you do it always in the morning? Do you do it at night? How do you spread it out? How does it affect my ability of my own thyroid to determine how much it needs and when it needs it?

**Speaker A** (34:57): All right, well, let's let Dr. Pete answer what it is that you've asked. And thanks for your question. Question. So we got a question about the vitamin D status. I think you said it was 36, 0, 39, 36. And then cortisol. Obviously concerned about adrenal production. So, Dr. P.

**Speaker B** (35:19): Thyroid is essential for making all of these steroids. And in a young person, the ratio, when you're under stress, there's a lot of cortisol produced, and that will, in a healthy person, that will also increase the cholesterol, Pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone backing up the cortisol. But with age, there's a constant decrease in the ratio of DHEA and the protective steroids in relation to cortisol. So that even though your average cortisol might stay the same with aging, in effect it's becoming constantly more active. You're more susceptible to side effects from the cortisol exposure because your dhea, pregnenolin and progesterone are going down constantly with aging, along with the decreasing cholesterol in all of the tissues.

**Speaker A** (36:29): Okay, I think just a mention here that everybody is very variable in their absorption of vitamin D. And for some people, you know, 2,000 or 4,000 IU a day is fine to keep their vitamin d up around 40, 45, 50. Some other people use 10,000 IU a day. And it does depend, I think weight is a factor that can lower the absorption of it, somebody's body weight. But basically using vitamin D as a supplement is probably one of the best ways to get it. Part of this month's show, we were going to discuss the actual production of it, but basically you get 90% or so of your vitamin D if you're not supplementing from the sunlight. So if you're really not in the sun that much, and we're going to talk about the scale here of vitamin D that's produced by sunlight versus the cancers, but topical or internal use of a vitamin D compound, either. Thorne Research do it. Life Extension do it. Carlson Labs do it. You know, there's plenty of it available and it's not expensive. But to get your vitamin d in the 50 nanogram per milliliter range is a very good strategy for maintaining good health. But let's just, let's just take this next caller, next caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? Where's your question?

**Speaker C** (37:49): Mike from Connecticut.

**Speaker A** (37:51): Hey, Mike, what's the question?

**Speaker C** (37:52): Yes, I just wanted to know Ray Pete's thoughts on the skin care bacteria and the role they play in health. Is it like what's in the gut where you want to keep the bacteria at a minimum? And if so, is the UV a good treatment for killing the bacteria in the skin? I'm just wondering if there's other ways to balance that. I find that, you know, UV treatment actually been quite potent to treat my acne. And I'm just wondering if that's, you know, something that's valuable as for uv.

**Speaker D** (38:25): Or if there's other ways like red.

**Speaker C** (38:28): Light or any other way of controlling the bad bacteria in the skin.

**Speaker A** (38:32): Yeah, I had a little trouble hearing the very first thing you said. But did you say korinibacterium, as in the bacteria that cause acne?

**Speaker D** (38:40): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (38:43): Both of you cut in. I couldn't hear that. Was he said. Yes, yes. Okay, good. So, Dr. Pete, did you, did you get the question there?

**Speaker B** (38:54): Yeah, the. I think thyroid and vitamin D are major factors in the immunity. There is another cholesterol metabolite, 25 hydroxycholesterol, which is very similar in function to 25 hydroxy vitamin D. They're very structurally similar and they both activate the immune system. And I think they work right along with vitamin A and the thyroid hormone in keeping the skin bacteria under control.

**Speaker A** (39:39): Okay, thank you for your question. So we're live here until 8 o'. Clock. If people would like to call in with any questions related to this month's topic of skin cancer, vitamin D, cholesterol and how they into play. A number here is 707-923-3911. Okay, so Dr. P. I've got lots more questions so we'll see how far we get in terms of people calling in or not. I wanted to know whether or not a vitamin D would be a useful topical treatment. Maybe not directly on a suspicious skin lesions, but maybe adjacent. Like I know you mentioned, progesterone shouldn't be typically topically put on, but adjacent to an area and then let the product migrate, which it will do through the skin. But do you think that a topical application of vitamin D with a saturated fat, either coconut oil or something like that, would be a reasonable approach to improving the vitamin D status in the skin? Because I know they interplay between cholesterol and skin cancers. There's a definite causal link between vitamin D cholesterol levels in the skin and the formation of skin cancers. So do you think.

**Speaker B** (40:53): Yeah, I think both vitamin D and cholesterol, especially with saturated fats to compete against the whatever polyunsaturateds happen to be in the skin. I think all three of those.

**Speaker G** (41:12): Have.

**Speaker B** (41:13): A good chance of overcoming the pre cancerous condition. In a typical cancer there will be a fully cancerized zone surrounded by lower degrees of conversion of the cells, as if something is being emitted from a center causing gradual progressive change in the surrounding tissue. It isn't that cells are traveling out, it's that the surrounding normal cells are gradually being injured the closer they are to the cancer. And part of that is that the normal metabolites are being suppressed by the toxins, such as lactic acid being emitted by the cancer cells and fairly well saturating the skin, both from the bloodstream. Internally taken supplements, but also from things applied topically in the vicinity are going to keep those pre cancerous cells from going the rest of the way and increasing the tumor. And about 20 years ago, someone was taking samples from facial skin of people who were just normally exposed to daylight and they found that almost everyone with any outside light exposure had quite a few mutated cells, precancerous cells in their facial skin. But when they covered the skin for just a few weeks, that same area that had been producing streams of mutated cells were entirely free of the mutant cells, showing that the body is able to kill off the bad cells and replace them with fresh non cancerous cells. Given the Chance letting them simply rest from the damage.

**Speaker A** (43:38): Now this, presumably this would be in instances perhaps where there wasn't severe and repeated sunburn as a direct cause of mutated DNA, but which is a very slight irritation that's not such a severe.

**Speaker B** (43:56): Yeah. And other people looking at middle aged people who had been killed in accidents found that everyone at the age of 50, if, if you did a thorough autopsy, everyone has cancer by the age of 50 somewhere in their body. Same principle as they saw in the facial skin. If you stop injuring it, it's going to return to normal. Most people don't die of cancer even though everyone by the age of 50 has cancer. So the thing is to stop making cancers in your body as far as possible. And I think that's, that's the function of applying things such as progesterone, vitamin D, cholesterol, maybe mevalanic acid.

**Speaker A** (44:51): Yeah, I want to ask you about that in a little bit, but we do have another caller. So let's take this caller. Caller, you're on the airway from. And what's your question?

**Speaker H** (45:00): My name is Chris and I'm here in Humboldt County.

**Speaker A** (45:02): Okay Chris, what was your question?

**Speaker H** (45:04): And I apologize in advance if I, you know, I'm basically asking the same question someone else already has. I just turned on the radio. I love your guys show so I appreciate the time you guys put in for it. I'm a white 51 year old. I grew up in Southern California getting baked, you know, on the, on the beach.

**Speaker A** (45:28): Right.

**Speaker H** (45:28): I, you know, have been severely sunburned, you know, several, many times as a kid. And then within the last 10 years I've, you know, kind of fought skin.

**Speaker B** (45:43): Cancer a little bit.

**Speaker H** (45:44): The, it's not the melanoma, it's the mesodermal or whatever.

**Speaker A** (45:52): A basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell.

**Speaker H** (45:56): I think it's the miso. Maybe it's supposed to be a less aggressive one.

**Speaker A** (46:01): Yeah, actinic keratosis is the start of it, I think.

**Speaker H** (46:04): Yeah, so that's the thing. You know, I gotten to where I can kind of recognize it and I've had a couple spots cut off and then I was called back into cut off some more because they found it around the periphery.

**Speaker A** (46:25): Right.

**Speaker H** (46:25): And basically what I'm kind of noticing.

**Speaker B** (46:29): Is that it's basically all over.

**Speaker H** (46:32): You know, there's tiny little spots. You know, maybe it's pre cancer or.

**Speaker B** (46:37): Whatever, but it's like, well, you try to cut all that stuff off, I.

**Speaker H** (46:41): Won'T have any skin. So I'm kind of wondering, you know, what you guys would recommend, what I should do or maybe even direct me towards, I don't know if it's on.

**Speaker B** (46:53): Your website, some literature that I should do some research.

**Speaker A** (46:57): Sure. Dr. Pete. Okay, what would you, what would you suggest for this 51 year old Southern Californian who's been burnt severely several times.

**Speaker B** (47:06): His description of the process reminded me of another person in Southern California who had to cancer on his ear. The doctor said he was going to have to cut off his ear to cure the cancer and the guy didn't want to cut off his ear and so he put I think it was progesterone or a mixture of progesterone and DHEA on it and a week or two later said it fell off. I said what? The ear? He said no, the cancer.

**Speaker H** (47:39): Progesterone and dh.

**Speaker B** (47:41): What's that?

**Speaker A** (47:42): Dhea.

**Speaker H** (47:43): Dhea.

**Speaker A** (47:44): Now I just want to put the caveat out there and Dr. Pete, you'll agree with this because you're the one who stated it, but in terms of using dhea, you need to make sure that your thyroid is working well. Otherwise you've risked, you know, you run the risk of converting that DHE into estrogen which you don't want to do because that in its own right is a pro cancerous compound. So make sure your thyroid function is working well and or if it isn't, use thyroid hormone. So whether it's desiccated, natural or indeed synthetic, which is absolutely fine, you should be making sure that your thyroid is working well so that you can convert that DHEA appropriately.

**Speaker B** (48:25): And sometimes skin cancers heal up just for increasing the thyroid, the thyroid, because the thyroid is going to increase the production of cholesterol and the immune steroids.

**Speaker H** (48:41): I guess that would require a visit to the doctor to check out my thyroid function or something.

**Speaker A** (48:48): Well, you could. Here's the thing though, you will probably find. Well, you know what, it's a good idea to get a metabolic panel done and see what your TSH is like. I found a lot of people have really overt symptoms of low thyroid which improve dramatically with thyroid hormone when their labs come back showing that their TSH is within the normal range. So that in and of itself is not diagnostic. Your temperature and pulses will be a very good way to see what your metabolic rate is, which is the underlying, you know, driver of your metabolism and hormone conversion, etc. So you know, you can get a blood test, see what your TSH is like. It might be, you know, fairly high. So that would be clinically A way to show that. But your temperature and pulses would be the best way to do that.

**Speaker H** (49:41): Okay, and is the DHC and progesterone, is that something someone can just go?

**Speaker A** (49:49): Yeah, yeah, they're both non prescription. Both DHEA and progesterone are both non prescription. They're dietary supplements, basically.

**Speaker H** (49:59): Okay, awesome.

**Speaker B** (50:00): All right, thank you.

**Speaker H** (50:01): Thank you guys.

**Speaker A** (50:02): Yeah, you're welcome. If you want to, you can always email me. I will send you a link to some resources that you can look at and indeed links of where you can buy quality products.

**Speaker B** (50:14): Was person who showed how effective the temperature check could be for diagnosing hypothyroidism and his books are still available on the Internet, I think very, very important to read for everyone.

**Speaker A** (50:30): There you go. Broda Barnes. Okay, we have. Excuse me, we have two callers, so let's see if we can squeeze them into the next at least eight minutes. Caller number one way from what's your question? And can we try and be as concise as we can?

**Speaker D** (50:44): Well, I'm from Long island and you mentioned skin, but vitamin E wasn't mentioned. And I know there's vitamin E and tocotrienols and I was just wondering which one is preferable and how would you use them in the context of this dialogue? The second question I have is royal jelly versus bee pollen. Are those the same thing and are they recommended or too much pufa?

**Speaker B** (51:11): Thank you.

**Speaker A** (51:11): Okay, thanks for your call. So did you hear the first question about the vitamin E?

**Speaker B** (51:17): Yeah. There is some information that the tocotrienols can enlarge doses in experimental animals. They cause liver enlargement, which suggests that they're treated as a toxin by the liver. And so ever since seeing that, I've been suspicious that maybe they're over emphasizing their value because of the amount of money they can sell them for as distinct from a traditional vitamin E. And one of the problems with vitamin E is it can preserve the amount of PUFA in the tissue. So it's important to keep your polyunsaturated fats down as well as using the vitamin E to block their effects as far as possible. Yeah.

**Speaker A** (52:16): Okay, so very quickly, the royal jelly versus the pollen aspect. I know you don't really agree with bee pollen because of the possible allergenic effects given that it's collected from such a wide range of plants. What about royal jelly? I know that's kept a fair amount of press.

**Speaker B** (52:34): It's extremely rich in nutrients and if there was a lot of it, everyone should probably eat some of it. But you don't want to steal the bees food. They're already having problems.

**Speaker A** (52:46): I know. All right, without going any further, we have two more callers. Let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the airway from.

**Speaker G** (52:53): Yeah, hi, I'm from Redway, California.

**Speaker A** (52:55): Hey, what's your question?

**Speaker G** (52:56): Well, I have a, I guess, yes, I have a question and an observation first. My 97 year old grandmother recently was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma on her nose. And the doctors were saying, look, you're going to croak before you know, but it was annoying to her.

**Speaker D** (53:13): So she's like.

**Speaker G** (53:13): And they said, well, we're going to have to cut your whole nose off basically to get at it.

**Speaker B** (53:17): And so what kind of cancer oil?

**Speaker A** (53:20): It was a squamous cell carcinoma.

**Speaker B** (53:22): Yes. I've had several old friends and myself with little cancers on the face that they went away from as little as a week to six months of applying progesterone or DHEA to them. And a friend who was, I think she was 94 at the time, time her face was being eaten away by melanoma and just a few applications of progesterone. Nearby there was a hole so that she couldn't put it directly in the melanoma.

**Speaker G** (54:02): Well, I have another question for you, which is that we applied cannabis oil as an alternative method and found efficacy within two weeks. I mean, and so she'd had it for about four months, four or five months. And you know, when I started telling people about this, they advised me and said, look, you know, that's anecdotal. Don't go around telling people that cannabis oil cures cancer because then you weirdos not doing traditional medicines in favor of the camp, you guys, I mean, but this happened in my case now like you said, maybe it went away on its own. It was a coincidence that we applied that oil. That could be. And I just tuned into the show. So I don't really know what you guys have been talking about that much, but I would like to get your thoughts since you guys both used to be medical professionals, on the potential efficacy of cannabis oil, whether it shouldn't or should not be administered and what results other people are finding with it. Do you have any thoughts on that?

**Speaker A** (54:52): Yeah, I'm afraid I don't. The only thing I would wonder was the product in what kind of oil was the product extracted?

**Speaker B** (55:02): Or is it just olive oil?

**Speaker A** (55:03): Olive oil, right.

**Speaker G** (55:04): It was basically hash. It was basically hashish mixed with olive oil to get onto it.

**Speaker B** (55:08): What it was I think the olive oil is more therapeutic than the cannabis oil. I heard somebody say that too. They said, you know, you don't know.

**Speaker G** (55:16): Maybe the olive oil, aloe leaf is.

**Speaker B** (55:22): Another thing that people have used successfully on skin cancers. Just squash the yellow leaf on. Was shocking to know that the doctor.

**Speaker G** (55:34): Basically had no thoughts. And he said, look, the doctor she went to was saying the only real remedy here for this is excision, cut the nose off. And obviously she didn't want to do that. But it's encouraging to note that there are other. Well, for anybody listening to the show that we could. What you guys have been talking about.

**Speaker B** (55:56): The oleic acid, which is the major fat in olive oil, increases synthesis of cholesterol. Well, that's great. I mean, so olive oil, I mean, wow.

**Speaker G** (56:12): Who knew?

**Speaker A** (56:14): I appreciate your input, caller. Thanks for your call.

**Speaker G** (56:18): Thanks for doing the show.

**Speaker A** (56:18): Yeah, you're welcome. It's a couple of minutes to eight, so I'll let you sign off. Dr. Pete, thanks so much for your doing the show, as you've always. I say always have. I can't remember when you last didn't, but thanks so much for your time.

**Speaker B** (56:32): Okay.

**Speaker A** (56:34): Okay. So we probably only got through about half of what I wanted to get through, but that's always good. I always like it when people call in. It shows that people are listening and they're interested and even when they sometimes don't call in very much, I get feedback on the Internet from the Ray Pete forum, etc. Just seeing just how many people are actually listening to it and wanting to actually hear what Ray Pete's got to say rather than other people. So it's always a catch 22. I know Dr. Pete likes to be engaged with people calling up and I know people like to hear what Dr. P has to say. So for those who called in, thanks for your time and your questions. For those who've not heard about Dr. Pete or maybe only just listen to him once or twice on the show, he's been doing this, like I said, for 45 plus years now. And a PhD endocrinologist who actually practices what he preaches. So that's the big difference there. His website is www.raypeat r a y p e a t.com and he's got plenty of scholarly articles that are fully referenced and will give you a very different perspective on things that you've been told are the way they are. And fortunately they are not the way they are, but they are alternatives. And for those people who also want to take a look at our website. It's www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com. and on the resources tab there are audio files from all of the shows that we've ever done. There are probably about eight months worth that still need to get put up from this year, but working hard on the back in the background to get this done. And also on YouTube. There are most of our radio shows on YouTube. So thanks so much for the callers. And until the third Friday of next month, have a good night and welcome to the rain in Southern Humboldt. Anyway, okay, good night.
