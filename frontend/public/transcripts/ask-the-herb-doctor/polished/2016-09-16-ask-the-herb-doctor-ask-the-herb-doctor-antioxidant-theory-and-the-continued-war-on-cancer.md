## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend supplements and nutritional counseling. You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of antioxidant theory and the continued war on cancer.

I wanted to open with a paraphrase of some of our previous discussions with Dr. Peat. In July, we discussed your newsletter entitled "100 Years of Cancer Metabolism," which outlined the stark contrast between the objective, scientific inquiry-based approach to disease—exemplified by early 20th-century biologists like Otto Warburg, Albert Szent-Györgyi, and William F. Koch—and the mechanistic, cancer-cidal approaches of the multi-billion dollar cancer industry. This industry has failed to find a cure, yet its funding continues to grow. It seems more a matter of continuing the war and the money generated by the fear of diagnosis.

The free radical theory of aging was conceived by Denham Harman in the 1950s, when prevailing scientific opinion held that free radicals were too unstable to exist in biological systems. Two sources inspired Harman: the "rate of living" theory, which holds that lifespan is an inverse function of metabolic rate, and Rebecca Gerschman's observation that hyperbaric oxygen toxicity and radiation toxicity could be explained by the same underlying phenomena: oxygen free radicals.

Now, Harman's hypothesis has been seriously challenged by recent studies showing that reactive oxygen species actually evoke metabolic health and longevity. As for Gerschman's observation, it's interesting that Joseph Priestley, the English chemist who discovered oxygen in 1774, questioned whether the gas essential to life might also be harmful. Modern research has revealed that oxygen is actually a very toxic material and that the body has antioxidant defense systems—like the enzyme superoxide dismutase, discovered by Erwin Fridovich and Joe McCord in 1967—to keep tissue oxygen levels from getting too high.

Dr. Peat, you've uncovered research which shows a different perspective on our understanding of antioxidants and how they should actually be referred to as pro-oxidants. Thank you for joining us again. Would you outline your academic background for our listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My biology study was at the University of Oregon, 1968 to 1972, where I worked on my thesis on reproductive aging and the oxidative metabolic changes involved in aging. At that time, I was bringing together information on oxidative metabolism developed over the preceding 50 years. I thought the situation was ripe for a conclusion. I couldn't have imagined that 45 years later, it would have gone backward to the 1890s situation of the government pushing a purely genetic causation of cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Harman's hypothesis would have been relevant at that time, in the 1950s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the 1950s, there were lots of new discoveries. Daniel Mazia and his collaborator Katsuma Dan discovered how the mitotic apparatus works—the controlled cell division. They found that the reduction of sulfur groups (sulfhydryls) increased at the time of cell division. If you look at those as the interface between metabolic energy production and cell growth, it suggests a direct course to curing tumor-producing and inflammatory diseases by working on metabolism. The genes are only in the background; they don't have a role in therapy.

## Antioxidants vs. Pro-oxidants

**Andrew Murray:** I think many recognize the terms "oxidant" and "antioxidant" erroneously. We've always looked at antioxidants as being the things we were looking for, yet in autopsies of the brain, they find things like glutathione—a main antioxidant—are not that depleted. How is your current understanding different? Essentially, you are saying antioxidants should be termed pro-oxidants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ones that are therapeutically useful, such as Vitamin E and Vitamin C, actually shift the balance inside the cell. Vitamin C is known to be in a very highly oxidized condition—it is dehydroascorbate when inside a healthy cell. These maintain a constant flow of electrons, but the balance is pushed in the direction closer to oxygen and farther from the reducing electrons.

If you are deficient in Vitamin E and C, the electrons predominate and shift over to reducing the sulfur groups all through the cell into the sulfhydryl form, promoting inflammation. When any injury happens, you disrupt the ability of the tissue to deliver oxygen and sugar. The cell is starved, can't oxidize, and has an immediate shift over to the antioxidant side. The cell has enzymes that function as antioxidants, but they are only activated during injury. In that condition, the sulfhydryls are reduced, the mitotic apparatus is activated, and cells de-differentiate to grow and repair. If the organism can deliver oxygen and sugar, they differentiate and finish healing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this whole theory that we don't want to oxidize things is wrong? We want the cell to be oxidizing, and an injured cell is actually in an anti-oxygen state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you get stuck in the antioxidant state, that keeps the healing process from being completed. That's where cancer is: stuck in the inflamed, antioxidant state, only able to divide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How do CoQ10, naringenin, and apigenin work inside the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coenzyme Q10 fits specifically into the mitochondria to deliver electrons to the electron transport system, delivering them ultimately to oxygen to complete the production of ATP and carbon dioxide. It plugs right into the oxidative system. It is oxidizing everything upstream. It is a necessary link between oxygen and the reducing factors. If you don't have that link, the electrons go into the growth and cell division system.

## PUFA, Iron, and Lipofuscin

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Where the actual "antioxidant" function comes in is when you have an oversupply of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). When you don't have enough oxygen and go into that inflamed state, the electrons that can't be taken up by oxygen are free to locate on iron atoms. The electrons activate the iron, which then attacks any polyunsaturated fats in the environment. That sets up an oxygen-consuming system which produces nothing of value. The electrons go to iron, which gives its electron to the PUFA, which becomes a free radical and consumes oxygen. You get cycles of oxidation without purpose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you want the oxidation to be in the cell producing carbon dioxide using sugar and oxygen—proper cellular respiration. You don't want to be in this reduced state where the PUFA and iron are hungry for oxygen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the process of consuming oxygen, they are creating oxygen starvation, setting up the situation to spread.

**Andrew Murray:** It's a very energy-wasteful situation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, an oxygen-wasting system. The PUFA become a trap for oxygen. As they deteriorate, they interact with iron and proteins to create "imitation oxidative enzymes." They act as a short circuit between NADH and oxygen by way of iron and proteins condensed in the form of age pigment, or lipofuscin. This functions as a powerful oxygen sink, keeping the mitochondria from getting the oxygen they need.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's why you don't want to eat fried foods cooked in vegetable oils—you create oxygen starvation for your cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. With age, organs like the brain, which are high-energy users, become slowed down and preferentially concentrate more highly unsaturated fats. DHA, the predominant fat in fish oil, concentrates in the brain with age and makes it more susceptible to lipid peroxidation.

**Andrew Murray:** I was looking at the link between Zika and microcephaly. I came across the term "neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis." Ceroid is a product produced as a result of the inability to remove lipofuscin. Types 1, 2, and 3 were associated with microcephaly. With reference to PUFA and the production of lipofuscin, how do you see microcephaly in the explanation of what Zika does?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It could be a virus, or it could be the insecticides people absorb when spraying mosquitoes. Insecticides are known to damage brain development. But 50 years ago, experiments in mice and dogs found that in proportion to the unsaturation of the fat in the mother's diet, brain development was retarded. The baby animals had smaller brains and were less able to learn.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't it true that the placenta will try and filter out all the polyunsaturated fat from the mother's diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The placenta preferentially absorbs glucose and fructose. But if the mother has low blood glucose, she liberates free fatty acids into the bloodstream. When the mother has hypoglycemia, the placenta loses the ability to screen out the fats. The baby should make its own brain fats purely from glucose.

**Andrew Murray:** And those would be saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Primarily saturated. But we are intrinsically able to make a series of polyunsaturated fats called the Omega-9 series (Mead acid). Those are present in any healthy baby's brain.

## Epilepsy and Longevity

**Andrew Murray:** Another thing associated with lipofuscinosis is epilepsy. How do you see epilepsy in relation to polyunsaturates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E has been proven to reduce the incidence of seizures in animal experiments. Stress in a brain cell lowers oxygen availability and triggers that reductive process, causing lipid peroxidation. If your tissues are saturated with Vitamin E, that's much less likely to happen.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move to longevity. Parrots are long-lived compared to quail, and the naked mole rat lives for 32 years compared to regular mice. What do you say about the longevity of different species?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Researchers like Hulbert and Pamplona have found that the highly unsaturated animals in a given species don't live as long. They find that birds generally are much less unsaturated in their tissues than mammals. Birds don't activate enzymes that extend linoleic acid into EPA or DHA to the extent mammals do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they can eat PUFA, but it doesn't turn into EPA or DHA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have more of the unprocessed linoleic acid. Part of that is because they live at a much higher body temperature—often well over 100°F. This means they will very quickly oxidize unstable fats for energy rather than storing them. Even in a mammal at 98°F, a high proportion of DHA breaks down before it gets into the bloodstream.

## Caller: PEMF Devices and CO2 Therapy

**Caller (Finland):** I'd like your opinion on two devices. First, PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) devices to induce delta sleep. Second, CO2 breathing machines or bath devices.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding PEMF, about 40 years ago there was research on stimulating the brain with gentle current—just one or two volts and very few microamps—to induce slower brain rhythms and improve sleep. I don't know the specifics of the current apparatus.

**Andrew Murray:** What about the CO2 question?

**Caller (Finland):** There are breathing machines and bath devices where you wrap yourself in a plastic bag infused with CO2.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1908, an article discussed medical uses of CO2, including filling a bathtub with the gas. Since CO2 is heavier than air, you can fill a tub and get in. The author said an hour in the tub was like a day at the beach. You don't have to take your clothes off; it goes right through clothing. You feel a warm sensation because it relaxes blood vessels in the skin.

We have used huge plastic bags. You fill the bag, step in, pull it up to your armpits, and seal it. It absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, improves the pumping efficiency of the heart, and reduces peripheral resistance in the arteries. Increasing your CO2 lowers all transmitters of inflammation by shifting you out of the over-reduced electronic state. It suppresses lactic acid production and activates the Krebs cycle.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you drink sparkling water? Would that help internally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You tend to burp it out, but the little bit you absorb is helpful. I think Priestley was really working on carbon dioxide when he accidentally discovered oxygen.

## Caller: CoQ10, EPA, and Vitamin E

**Caller (Phillipsville):** I want to get clear on what's good and bad. Is CoQ10 good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very good.

**Caller (Phillipsville):** What about EPA (fish oil)? I heard it supports heart function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's exactly the wrong kind of antioxidant. It's the reductive kind that imitates stress and promotes degenerative processes.

**Caller (Phillipsville):** So CoQ10 is okay, but not EPA. What about Vitamin E?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E is good. Along with Vitamin C and Vitamin K, it functions with Coenzyme Q10 to deliver energy.

**Caller (Phillipsville):** And glucosamine for joints?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm doubtful about that. It's been associated with changes in the pancreas, like diabetes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just last month, an article came out by Su and Yuen identifying EPA and DHA as brain-toxic fats.

## Caller: Eye Color Changes

**Caller (Bay Area):** I've noticed tremendous results on your nutrition program and thyroid hormone. My question is, why are my eyes changing color? They were brown and are getting lighter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who use prostaglandin eye drops to treat glaucoma often have a darkening of the iris. I think the prostaglandin, which is made from polyunsaturated fats, activates the defensive formation of pigment. If you reduce your PUFA intake and have lightening of the iris, I suspect it's a corrective process.

## Caller: MCT Oil and Vitamin K

**Caller (Finland):** Does MCT oil do the same good things as coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Essentially, yes. It bypasses stored polyunsaturated fats and lets you oxidize saturated fats safely. However, because they are so mobile, they can be irritating to the stomach and intestine. You have to take it in balance with other foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you describe the relation between Vitamin K and CoQ10?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin K works at the same site in the mitochondrion. It seems to act as a stabilizer or amplifier of the effect of Coenzyme Q10.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you need to supplement CoQ10 if you use Vitamin K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wouldn't mix them, even in your stomach. I think it's good to take them at different times because I've seen a reaction—at least in the presence of light—where Vitamin E reacts with Vitamin K.

## Caller: Thyroid Labs and TSH

**Caller (Albion):** I have Hashimoto's. My TSH was 0.48, Free T4 was 0.97, and T3 was 110. The endocrinologist wants to increase medication to make the thyroid "go to sleep."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is probably a safe level, but I know people who keep TSH at 0.01 and feel fine. TSH is a promoter of inflammation in the thyroid, blood vessels, and bone marrow. It is activated by the stressed, oxygen-deprived condition of cells. TSH itself is an inflammation promoter.

You should govern your dose by things like heart rate, temperature (especially mid-day), appetite, thirst, and quality of sleep. The Achilles reflex relaxation test can show how nerves and muscles are acting. If you have a lot of circulating PUFA and prostaglandins, a given amount of T3 won't have the same effect.

**Caller (Albion):** So the feeling of being strangled in the thyroid might have more to do with generalized inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you are low thyroid, you produce extra antibodies as part of the cleanup process.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. George Crile at the Cleveland Clinic in the 1970s found that for most types of thyroid cancer, keeping TSH near zero prevents almost all recurrences.

## Caller: Magnesium and Belly Fat

**Caller (Miranda):** I take magnesium glycinate. It helps my nerves, but whenever I take it, my belly fat gets worse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Magnesium supplements can cause intestinal inflammation or irritation. I would guess that is happening with an increase of histamine, nitric oxide, and endotoxin absorption. The "fat" increase might be water retention caused by inflammation.

**Caller (Miranda):** I also have an enlarged prostate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is the basic thing because it helps you make anti-inflammatory steroids like pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, and keeps down estrogen. When the intestine is irritated, inflammation spreads through the pelvis. It causes the smooth muscle of the bladder wall to become hyperactive, causing frequent urination. Many people assume it's the prostate when it's really the intestine inflaming the urinary system.

**Caller (Miranda):** So magnesium might be indicated, but the supplement is irritating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your thyroid lets your cells retain magnesium, then 400mg per day is easy to get from foods: fruit, milk, cheese, eggs, meat, and seafood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you have a thyroid deficiency, you aren't able to store magnesium properly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you correct the thyroid, it helps you extract magnesium from your ordinary diet. For a vegetarian, boiling green leaves releases magnesium into the water very quickly.
