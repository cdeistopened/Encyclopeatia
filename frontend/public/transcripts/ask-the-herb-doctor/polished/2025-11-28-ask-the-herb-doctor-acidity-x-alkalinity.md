## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville. From 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of alkalinity versus acidity with reference to disease. We are very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat to share his wisdom and expertise with us for this next hour. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you, as usual, give the listeners who perhaps have never heard you before a rundown of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology at the University of Oregon and, since about 1970, have just continued on my own, figuring things out, talking to a lot of people, and listening to their problems. Almost every time I talk to someone, I learn something about physiology.

**Andrew Murray:** You did a PhD in physiology based on hormones, didn't you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reproductive physiology and aging was the subject of my dissertation.

**Andrew Murray:** We really enjoy having you here to share your experience because you provide the scientific reference for what most people just spout out as truth. This month, we've mentioned cancer, and I know your specialism with metabolism and thyroid hormone—which are pro-life and not inflammatory—brings me to this topic of alkalinity and acidity, generally summed up as pH.

The main reference for cancer is that cancers seem to predominate in acidic environments. Our diets, through poor proteins or foods like beans, seeds, and some meats, produce acidic byproducts. How do you look at these traditional ideas about the acid-base balance of food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They usually lead to a pretty good diet. For example, the Indian diet—fruit, vegetables, milk, and cheese—is a good example of the alkaline residue diet. So, I don't have any disagreement with the dietary recommendations to eat lots of milk, cheese, fruit, and vegetables.

It's the small details that people use to argue for certain refinements of that diet that are problematic. For example, the fear of milk. They talk about the loss of calcium in the urine as indicating that maybe it's too much acid. But actually, the residue of milk is on the alkaline side because of the very large amount of potassium and calcium in the milk. Very similar to the vegetables that the cows eat to make the milk, they accumulate a huge amount of alkaline minerals.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about the residue. That is what is left behind once the food source has been metabolized, and that dictates whether a food is what we call alkaline or acidic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Grains, nuts, beans, and meats do have a very acidic residue or ash after they're metabolized. The biggest part of that in meat, nuts, and grains is phosphate. Proteins have a lot of sulfur which turns into sulfuric acid when it's metabolized. It is possible to do biological harm by eating too much of those and not enough of the potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium side.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which are predominantly found in fruits, vegetables, milk, and cheese.

## The Physiology of Carbon Dioxide and Acidity

**Andrew Murray:** Would you run through some of the more commonly experienced acidic production processes in the body, whether respiratory or urinary, and how the body deals with maintaining the pH balance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it helps to look at the picture in the very biggest context: mostly, we're a huge lump of protein. Protein is, on average, acidic. If you just leave acid sitting around in the environment, it will accumulate the base that neutralizes it. So, if we think of ourselves as a big piece of acidic protein, this spontaneously will associate alkaline material with it—potassium and magnesium, for example—to neutralize the acidity of the protein.

But as we energize our system by burning carbohydrate and fat, the carbohydrate in particular turns into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide has to constantly be leaving the organism. What comes in is oxygen. The oxygen combines with the fuel carbon and becomes carbon dioxide. Oxygen essentially means "the acid former." The acid that it forms in this case is carbonic acid.

We're constantly metabolically producing this acid, which is streaming out of our cells and leaving through our lungs primarily. The kidneys hardly lose any carbon dioxide or bicarbonate. As the carbon dioxide is produced, combining with water, it turns into carbonic acid, which ionizes. So you have the acidic carbonic acid leaving the cell as a charged particle. It takes the oppositely charged sodium with it. Sodium and calcium are constantly being drawn out of the cell by the stream of carbonic acid being produced inside the cell.

The alkaline minerals reach the bloodstream in balance with the carbonic acid. Then the carbonic acid leaves the lungs as carbon dioxide, leaving an alkaline trace in the blood. The cell basically was neutral until it produced the acid. Then that neutralized protein gave up some of its mineral alkaline material, which then shows up in the blood. So the pH of the blood is above neutral, about pH 7.4.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because of the carbonic acid leaving.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In this healthy metabolism, the mineral gets pulled out of the neutral cell. With the acid being constantly formed, the cell shows its basic protein acidity. So, the respiring cell is normally slightly on the acidic side. A good, healthy cell with plenty of oxygen will be around pH 6.8.

If you stress a cell so it isn't getting enough carbon dioxide—or stress it via radiation, lack of oxygen, etc.—the cell becomes activated and shifts to the alkaline because it can't make carbon dioxide to acidify itself. It begins producing lactic acid very inefficiently.

With lactic acid, the sugar, instead of being oxidized all the way to carbon dioxide, stops at pyruvic acid. The cell reduces the pyruvic acid to lactic acid by taking some of the energy substance produced in metabolism and wasting it to get rid of the electrons. In that process, the lactic acid takes protons out of the cell and raises the pH of the cell. The conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid increases the pH of the cell—just the opposite of what the production of carbon dioxide was doing. So, the stressed cell becomes alkaline.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When the popular theory states that cancer cells like an acidic environment, it sounds like if a cell is stressed, it actually likes an alkaline environment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it shifts internally to become alkaline when it's stressed. But the produced lactic acid accumulates in its environment, and that's where the acid is—in the surroundings.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. So that's like if you've stressed your muscle out too much, you're producing lactic acid, which makes your muscles sore. Is lactic acid playing a big part in cancer as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It acidifies the environment, which in itself could actually be protective if it was acidified by carbon dioxide. But it happens that lactic acid acts as a signal to do all of the things associated with cancer, such as stimulating the growth of new blood vessels so that inflammation continues. It signals inflammatory changes, vasodilation, and the release of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide—lots of things producing free radicals and injury.

The lactic acid is functioning as a local poison or inflammatory agent. The acidity it produces is a sign that something is wrong, but it isn't the acidity in the tumor that's harmful, because the tumor itself is internally alkaline.

## Lactic Acid in Food and Stress

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you think of foods that are high in lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even when we make it ourselves, it has these pro-inflammatory, swelling-producing, tumor-promoting functions. When it's made by bacteria, it's somewhat more toxic. When the body receives it—either from a stressed muscle, a tumor, or from too much yogurt or fermented food—it goes to the liver to get detoxified. So every time you eat something with lactic acid, it's the same as if you had been stressed physically. Your liver has to work extra to detoxify it, turning it back into glucose. And glucose is right back where you started. So you've lost ground every time your liver has to process lactic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So would you consider any amount of lactic acid-containing food to be a stress to the liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A healthy liver doesn't notice an occasional dish of yogurt or sauerkraut. But I got interested in it a long time ago when I discovered kefir. It tasted good, so I drank a little more than a cup each day for lunch. Every time I did that, I would get a migraine-like headache every afternoon. That started me looking up what happens to your blood sugar and inflammatory mediators when you get more lactic acid than your liver likes.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you think about people's lifestyles promoting an acidic situation from stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nervous system is in control of metabolism to a great extent, so you don't have to run five miles to shift over into that stress metabolism. If your nervous and emotional systems are very stressed, just the thought of what you're doing can trigger it.

If you hang an animal by its tail or put it in a tube where it can't move, it will very quickly get an ulcer with lactic acid going to all of its systems, releasing histamine and serotonin. But if you give the animal something to bite, even though it's in the same restrained, stressful situation, as long as it can defend itself by biting back, it doesn't get the ulcer.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think this could explain why people have said that those who are angry and let it out generally don't get cancer, while those who hold it in are more susceptible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The rat experiment really suggests that.

**Andrew Murray:** So the stressed businessman who is always trying to meet deadlines—is that a potential for a situation where cancer could arise because of the acidity from stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it is actually the things like lactic acid and serotonin doing the damage by creating an intracellular *alkaline* condition.

For example, when someone is under surgery, they often get ulcers or lung and brain inflammation from the stress. They found gradually, 60 or 70 years after the original discovery, that if they don't ventilate patients too thoroughly—letting them accumulate quite a bit of carbon dioxide—their lungs and brain are protected and don't swell. The acidity from carbon dioxide is extremely anti-stress and protective. It's the alkalinity that goes with producing lactic acid which does the harm.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people get stomach ulcers if they're stressed because instead of their cells holding onto the acid, it releases it into the environment and damages the stomach lining?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's really the serotonin and other inflammatory things in the stomach rather than just the acid. The stomach is very good at holding extreme acidity safely. But when stress gives the wrong kind of signals and you don't have continuing respiration, then you get the damage.

## Consuming Alkaline Minerals

**Andrew Murray:** How realistic is it to consume alkalizing materials, and how would that affect the overall acid-base balance when the stomach is so acidic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very safe to consume a great excess of the alkaline material with fruit, vegetables, and milk. The body can change protein into ammonium. If it doesn't have enough mineral, it will waste protein, turning it into the equivalent of the alkaline material and using the ammonia as the cation equivalent of sodium so it can save the sodium and calcium.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think consuming things with an excess of potassium, magnesium, and calcium can actively work to raise the pH of someone's environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main function is sparing protein that you would use for the kidneys to regulate minerals. When a person is fasting for several days, they will generally lose more protein than fat because the stress hormones rise. They live on a "pure meat diet" when they're fasting as their tissues break down. During that fast, if you just drink the minerals—salt water, baking soda, potassium, magnesium, and calcium—you will radically spare the amount of protein that you would be wasting. A fast is much less stressful and harmful if you are getting the alkaline minerals.

## Caller: Carbon Dioxide and Stress

**Caller:** Is the carbon dioxide exchange you spoke of why it's so calming to re-breathe carbon dioxide when you're in stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Stress shifts the body to the alkaline and makes lactic acid; the cells are in danger of getting into a chronically activated state. The panic attack is a typical thing where the body too easily shifts over into making lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. The person feels that they're suffocating. In the long run, that same thing can lead to degenerative diseases or cancer in which the cells are stuck in a "panic attack" condition.

If you think of the original state of the cell as being the protein acid, which attracts the minerals to neutralize the acid, you can restore that condition with carbon dioxide. Just re-breathing it, getting your percentage of the acidic carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood up where it should be, you can stop the production of lactic acid, reverse these stress processes, and restore the cell to its relaxed, un-panicked condition.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's through bag breathing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. You can generally lower your blood pressure just breathing a minute or two in a paper bag a few times a day. I've seen people take their blood pressure down 30 points in just a day or two that way.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it really is a de-stressor not only for the mental state but for all the other cellular states that are panicking.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Every cell or tissue is protected if you restore the proper amount of carbon dioxide. Breathing in a bag is one of the most powerful ways to restore the proper balance. If you need more bicarbonate, the gaseous carbon dioxide will allow you to make more bicarbonate, and that will help you regulate your minerals and help you retain more of your alkaline minerals.

Taking sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), for example, will actually acidify cells that are in need of more carbon dioxide. When a cell is exposed to the bicarbonate, it will convert it into the acidic carbon dioxide and be able to lower its pH, even though you've taken the alkaline baking soda.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that why you recommend baking soda for athletes, to help balance out that high lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There have been experiments in marathon or bicycle races in Death Valley where the altitude is very low. They found that a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of the race made them tolerate the stress much better.

## Caller: Smoking and Carbon Dioxide

**Caller (Michael):** I heard a study that the mortality rate in Japan, which has a high smoking population, is much higher than here in America. Does smoking increase carbon dioxide in the body to relax it?

**Andrew Murray:** I think the caller was asking if smoking was an efficient way of raising your CO2.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It raises carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is something that we produce under stress, and it lowers our ability to use oxygen and to produce carbon dioxide.

**Andrew Murray:** So the carbon monoxide from smoking is pretty damaging.

**Caller (Michael):** Do you have any thoughts about why the Japanese culture has such longevity or lower mortality, especially since they do consume a lot of tobacco?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, much of that is propaganda. When you look at the actual details of the population, it isn't as great as some of the articles have been saying. One article suggested that the average lifespan is 300 shepherds (sic). If you don't look at the whole structure of the population, it's hard to get an idea of what the real age-specific death rate is.

That's the trouble with the United States. Since the turn of the century, they stopped publishing the actual raw figures. They give an age-adjusted mortality rate. So I don't think anyone outside of the Bureau of Statistics really is sure what the longevity of Americans is right now.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Back to the caller's question—you don't think smoking raises carbon dioxide in any way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does, but it raises the carbon monoxide so seriously that that's the main effect, and it's harmful.

## Bicarbonate Supplements and Diet

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned sodium bicarbonate for the athletes in Death Valley giving them a greater interval between getting stressed. Is potassium bicarbonate something that could be used similarly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The average person is very good at getting rid of sodium, so sodium bicarbonate is something most people can use without experiencing edema or blood pressure disturbance. Potassium bicarbonate has a relaxing effect on your blood vessels, so it can help to lower your blood pressure even more than the sodium bicarbonate. But you have to be cautious because too much of it can relax your heart too much.

**Andrew Murray:** What would be an ideal lifestyle you would suggest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only foods I would suggest eliminating would be the grains, beans, and most of the nuts. I would probably suggest reducing most meats. Gelatin happens to be the part of the meat that doesn't have so many of the disturbing acidic, pro-inflammatory effects. In the news currently is the "pink slime" issue, which is made from connective tissues. It seems to me that might be the best part of the meat.

## Caller: Baking Soda Baths

**Caller:** Whenever I do short walks, I get muscle soreness for a couple of days afterwards. So I'm assuming I'm making too much lactic acid. I started taking baking soda baths. Is it safe to use about two pounds of baking soda per day in a bath?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's good. Salt, magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), and baking soda are all good. The baking soda helps you absorb magnesium if you have Epsom salts mixed with it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's a good combo, like maybe one pound baking soda and one pound Epsom salts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Experimenters in naturally carbonated mineral springs found that people were absorbing carbon dioxide through their skin. Even though their body contains a lot of carbon dioxide, the body has such an affinity for it that it will soak it up from the mineral water against the gradient. It's as if we had pumps in our skin. It's a matter of solubility. The enzymes turn the bicarbonate into the gaseous carbon dioxide form, which dissolves in our fats and cells.

## Vitamin C Sources

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about cancer treatments using ascorbate at high rates? I understand the processing for these things is less than desirable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 10 years ago, free radical chemists dissolved a gram of pure powdered ascorbic acid in a liter of distilled water. They found there were enough heavy metals in that purified vitamin C to produce as many free radicals as a killing dose of X-rays would have produced.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Oh my goodness. It's citrus season; that's a great source of Vitamin C.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of our foods except grains and beans are very good sources of vitamin C. The analytic methods have generally ignored it in meat and solid foods, but it's present in meats at a very high concentration in the oxidized state. All you have to do is metabolize it to turn the oxidized ascorbic acid back into common ascorbic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They say in Britain it was the fish and chips that prevented the people from developing scurvy because potatoes have quite a lot of vitamin C.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and fish.

## Cancer, Altitude, and Gerson Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** What would be the best way for people dealing with cancer to maintain enough energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The so-called alkaline ash diet—lots of fruits, vegetables, milk, and cheese—will help let the stressed cancer cell repair itself as far as it can. Things like breathing in a paper bag to increase the carbon dioxide are probably helpful.

As long ago as 1910, insurance companies knew that people who lived at very high altitudes had a very low cancer mortality. That has been tested experimentally. Fifty years ago, they implanted tumors in rats. Those left near sea level quickly died. Taking them up to 17,000 ft altitude, half of them threw off the cancers and had no symptoms left just from the carbon dioxide retention when the oxygen tension was lowered.

Carbon dioxide's basic function is to assure the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Heavy breathing, or hyperventilating, blows out carbon dioxide. You need a lot of carbon dioxide in your tissue to open up the blood vessels and let the oxygen circulate and be used.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about Gerson Therapy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got a copy of his book in the early 1960s and was very impressed by his detailed studies. The minerals are a very important part of it, restoring the oxidative metabolism. He regularly gave his people Armour Thyroid; I think two grains was a very common dose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you took thyroxine or Armour Thyroid, and suddenly couldn't get it, how much of a mammal's thyroid would you need to eat to get the dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Armour product was standardized to imitate the fresh glandular weight. They would powder and defat the gland, then dilute it with glucose or lactic acid to increase the weight until it was similar to the fresh gland. The powder itself was called the 3x concentrate. That means that 1 gram of the fresh gland is equal to 15 grains of Armour Thyroid.

## Caller: The "Death Valley Milkshake"

**Caller (Jeff Wright):** What would a double latte, espresso, pink slime milkshake with a tablespoon of baking soda do for an athlete's performance in the Death Valley race?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You would need a lot of ice. I think the caffeine tends to enhance performance in mysterious ways. The gelatin (from the "pink slime") has an anti-stress effect. That mixture seems like it would be pretty good: baking soda, gelatin content. And you would need quite a bit of sugar with it, preferably fructose.

**Andrew Murray:** That brings up another question. People read that cancers feed on sugar and you've got to starve a cancer of sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, they feed on amino acids, turn the amino acids into sugar, turn some of the sugar back into fat, and then metabolize the fat. With all that silly chemistry, they produce a lot of heat with no function. That's why you can identify a cancer with thermography—because it's so hot from burning protein.

So if you can feed it as much sugar as possible, then it won't eat your protein, at least not so fast. It could prevent the wasting disease associated with cancer.

I would recommend avoiding all of the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) because those turn on the stress reactions, increase your adrenal corticoids, adrenaline, and pituitary hormones. Saturated fats inhibit those same stress systems.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just for our listeners, PUFA includes liquid vegetable oils, not including olive oil. Saturated fats are coconut oil, beef and lamb fat, butter, and cream.

**Andrew Murray:** Going back to the Gerson diet, what about the injected liver extracts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a way to get all of the essential nutrients right. Around the time I read his book, I met Leonell Strong, who developed the cancer-prone strains of mice. He had been curing cancer just with an extract of liver. That was my first research project—trying to find out what it was in the liver extract that could cure cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Gerson also wanted to eliminate salt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another person who studied cancer at the basic level was William Frederick Koch. Working on parathyroid hormone, he found that alkaline minerals would substitute for each other to a tremendous extent. You could cure a calcium problem caused by removing parathyroid glands using sodium, potassium, or magnesium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the salt could replace the calcium or the potassium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Any of those alkaline minerals can replace the others. So you don't have to worry about the balance so much because the body can sort them out.

## Caller: High Altitude Simulation and Potato Protein

**Caller:** Can you simulate being at high altitude by eating a lot of baking soda?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's what the bicycle racers were doing in Death Valley. When someone who lives at a high altitude goes to sea level, they very often get sick. Oxygen poisoning is really worse than the alternative.

**Caller:** Is this diet stuff specifically for people with cancer, or can regular people adjust their diet? I'm vegan and looking for protein sources.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Potatoes are the best vegetable protein known. They have 106% of the protein quality ranked next to egg yolk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think 8 ounces of potato has 8 grams of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you consider eating the starch too. A liter of potato is like a liter of milk on average. If you make potato juice and allow the starch to settle out, then drink the juice, it's more like eating pure egg yolk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You can make a scrambled egg-like preparation from potato juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen that for people with mysterious ailments who seem to be dying. One or two meals and they just popped out of it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You'd recommend cooking the raw potato juice, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. My experience is cooking it like scrambling an egg.
