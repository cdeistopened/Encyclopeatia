## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our show, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herb extracts.

You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. From 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of carbon monoxide and its interactions. The number here is 923-3911, or 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

This month, we are very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat back on the show. It astounds me where he has spent his postdoctoral life researching. This subject, carbon monoxide, is something he was researching 30 years ago regarding its implications in toxicology and the pathogenesis of disease. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were a couple of topics that directed me towards carbon monoxide. I had previously been very interested in Otto Warburg's theory of cancer. One of his experiments to study the respiratory enzyme involved poisoning that enzyme with carbon monoxide. I was aware that the most interesting enzyme of all happened to be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide poisoning. He found that light restored the activity of that enzyme. That came back to my attention when I was studying the toxic effects of the long, northern, dark winters—specifically, the lack of light exposure leaving this enzyme susceptible to poisoning.

**Andrew Murray:** I wouldn't want anyone listening to be deprived of getting a little background information from you. Would you give people an idea of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I went from teaching linguistics and humanities subjects right into graduate school in biology because I wanted to understand how the brain works when it does things such as making language or art. I was studying nerve biology at the beginning and found that it was a very dogmatic area. Within about six months, I had switched over to the other end of the organism: reproductive physiology and how aging affects that.

## Carbon Monoxide, Aging, and Neurodegeneration

**Andrew Murray:** Aging and cell degeneration is becoming a major topic in the popular press. We are hearing much more about neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This relates fairly intimately with carbon monoxide, doesn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They find that old brains, in general, have increased amounts of the enzyme that produces carbon monoxide in the tissues. Any tissue can produce it, but stress increases the amount of the enzyme. The more stress there is, the more risk there is of poisoning itself.

Not only does increasing age increase the enzyme, but they find that schizophrenic brains, Alzheimer's brains, and Parkinson's brains have increased amounts of the enzyme. In the particular area affected by Parkinson's disease, they see an increased amount of the enzyme breaking down heme. This releases iron as well as carbon monoxide. Deposits of iron are found in that area of the Parkinson's brain.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's refresh for people. The enzyme is heme oxygenase, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Give us a run-through of what that is doing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It attaches oxygen atoms to the heme molecule, which is what carries oxygen in hemoglobin. The heme molecule binds iron, which in turn binds oxygen. However, carbon monoxide is similar enough electrically to oxygen that it can out-bind oxygen and displace it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we can be exposed to carbon monoxide from external sources, like burning fuel, but you're saying this is also happening inside our bodies and inside our cells due to an enzyme?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is the only way the body has to get rid of unused or inappropriately released hemoglobin. Anytime a tissue is injured and leaks blood, the hemoglobin is potentially very toxic in itself. To detoxify this hemoglobin—which would act as an enzyme wildly consuming oxygen—the enzyme is present in every injured tissue to destroy the heme and turn it into things that can be recycled, such as the iron atom and the carbons.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this enzyme has a function in damaged tissue to help mop up waste products, but in certain brain situations like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, it's in excess amounts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Apparently because of chronic stress. In multiple sclerosis (MS), they find it exactly associated with the problematic cells in the brain. In the plaques, they find increased amounts of the enzyme making carbon monoxide.

I came back to this topic in the 90s, applying it to multiple sclerosis, because the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are very similar to those of MS.

**Andrew Murray:** Go ahead and describe them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Clots tend to form in the brain. Every place there's a clot, the blood vessels become leaky, and proteins leak out into the brain as part of the inflammatory process. Carbon monoxide activates those same processes: a tendency to clot and a definite tendency for blood vessels to become leaky.

Anytime you have a situation of leaky blood vessels—an injured liver leaking enzymes, inflamed muscles, or a heart attack—you find heme oxygenase and carbon monoxide there, making the cells more permeable.

**Andrew Murray:** Am I right in thinking that carbon monoxide is actually produced by tumors too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In transplanting a tumor into an animal, they found it had many toxic effects on the animal. For years they talked about a "cancer hormone." In one set of experiments, they gave a chemical to the animal receiving the tumor implant that would inhibit heme oxygenase and stop the formation of carbon monoxide. This stopped the toxic effects of the transplant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that a potential anti-cancer treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, several groups are working on it. They can stop cancer growth for a week at a time with an injection of chemicals that turn off heme oxygenase.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this would have possible clinical applications with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. All of the degenerative stress-related diseases—cancer, brain aging, atherosclerosis, and arthritis—involve excess carbon monoxide.

## The Body's Defense Mechanisms

**Andrew Murray:** Let's go back for the benefit of the listeners. Heme oxygenase is part of our body. Every cell has the ability to break down hemoglobin into iron, carbon monoxide, and bilirubin. Our blood cells turn over every 90 days, and the spleen mops up these blood cells 24/7. What is the mechanism by which we're protected from the carbon monoxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One design feature is that having it all happen in the spleen keeps it away from your brain, heart, and reproductive organs.

**Andrew Murray:** What about people who have had a splenectomy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know exactly what the consequences are, but you would think it would expose their other tissues more to the effects of chronic stress.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about when someone has an enlarged spleen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I imagine that as long as it's confined to the spleen, the carbon monoxide has the chance to diffuse away in the bloodstream and be diluted before it gets to the organs.

## Environmental Sources: Stoves and Heaters

**Andrew Murray:** Propane, if burned incompletely, produces carbon monoxide. Traffic exhaust and smoking are other examples.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And wood smoke too, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a bad stove or fireplace can put out a huge amount of carbon monoxide. Even if you have a perfectly adjusted gas stove, if you put a cold pan down on the burner so that the flame touches it, cooling the flame will make it release carbon monoxide.

**Andrew Murray:** You were consulting with someone recently who had a good carbon monoxide meter. Talk about that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were having symptoms and noticed they were worse in the winter when the house was tightly closed up. They had access to a very sensitive meter that would measure down to a few parts per million (ppm). They found that just 15 minutes of having the stove burners on produced 15 ppm, and the oven produced 29 ppm.

It's a matter of how long you keep breathing it. In one experiment with rats, they exposed them to the supposedly upper safe limit for human exposure in cities—50 parts per million. In just one hour, the rats' brains were structurally damaged.

**Andrew Murray:** Were they getting infarcts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, much less than that. Small cellular changes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And 50 ppm is the level in a lot of cities?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It comes and goes. But they saw permanent changes in prolonged exposure to even lower amounts in the animals, like 30 parts per million.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So cooking over a gas stove could expose you to unhealthy levels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The symptoms are very rarely associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. Doctors traditionally thought only in terms of the blood being saturated and unable to deliver oxygen. But carbon monoxide goes right into all of the tissues. We have many enzymes that use heme, such as the enzymes that make steroids.

The most intense symptom is poisoning the energy-producing enzyme. But very moderate amounts of chronic poisoning will shut down your ability to produce steroids. Testosterone levels, for example, fall with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. Interestingly, adrenal corticosteroids increase because the adrenals recognize a stress emergency.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** People's houses are becoming more airtight. Do you think we're going to see more Alzheimer's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first symptoms are often so light that people just think they have a chronic cold. Sometimes people get anxious or depressed. Some have crawling sensations on their skin, muscle cramps, or heart arrhythmia. Practically any symptom you can think of is a sign of carbon monoxide poisoning, but it's rare for anyone to think of it.

## CO Detectors and Regulations

**Andrew Murray:** Let's cover government regulations concerning carbon monoxide detectors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago, I bought a cheap meter. I put it in the garage with the car running and left it for half an hour, and nothing happened. I learned that the industry and government require that they not sound an alarm unless the concentration reaches a life-threatening point. If it's a low level, below 50 ppm, one standard says it has to stay at that concentration for 48 hours before the alarm can sound.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What would that do to your brain if you had 50 ppm for 48 hours?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is definitely not a healthy concentration. But they don't want you bothering the fire department anytime you get a burst of 70 ppm.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What is the name of the sensitive meter you mentioned?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen it on the internet. One company is Kidde. I think they had one for around $340 that registered down in parts per million, which is useful. You want to know, for example, if you breathe out; a healthy person will make less than 1 ppm exhalation. If they are very sick and under stress, they might go up to 5 ppm just from internal production.

**Andrew Murray:** Smoking exposes a smoker to about 500 ppm from a cigarette.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in that little stream. If you had that concentration in your room air, you would be dead pretty quickly. But you're breathing quarts of air for every puff of smoke, so it is diluted.

## Caller: Liver Health and Thyroid

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our first caller.

**Caller:** I have a question for Raymond Peat. I recall a couple of years ago he was talking about thyroid and curing liver problems. He mentioned staying off clear oils, using coconut and butter only. What was that protocol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thyroid is the essential thing for energizing the burning of any fuel. If your thyroid function is low, your liver is the first organ to feel it because the liver stores sugar. If you're wasting energy, your liver fails to store sugar and becomes inefficient, eventually fibrotic.

**Caller:** What should I do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main dietary things that suppress thyroid function are the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). That's why I mention the importance of saturated fats such as coconut oil and butter, and sugar as a way to make your own fat. Avoid dietary oils such as safflower, soy, and corn oil, which are anti-thyroid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So avoid all liquid oils. Only use butter and coconut oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And adequate protein.

## Caller: Seasonal Thyroid Dosage

**Caller:** I had a question about hypothyroid and how it can be improved in warm, sunny weather. Is that beneficial because it temporarily masks symptoms, or does it have a long-term corrective effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just getting warm lowers the stress hormones, so it gives your body a chance to recover. But if you haven't changed the diet that was causing the problem, then cold weather or other stress will tend to bring back the hypothyroidism.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't it also that decreased daylight makes your thyroid hormone less able to be picked up by your cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thyroid is trying to keep the mitochondria functioning. During darkness, various toxins, including carbon monoxide, interrupt the function of the mitochondrion, which blocks the function of the thyroid. If you increase your thyroid, you can compensate a little bit for that disruption.

In animal experiments, they found that after removing a rat's thyroid gland, they would have to give four times as much supplement in the winter as in the summer because of the increased stress of the dark days. When I tested it on myself, it was exactly a four-times requirement difference according to the season.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you asked your doctor, they wouldn't recommend increasing your medication four times in the winter. You have to follow your own symptoms.

**Caller:** So it's almost as if the thyroid is being wasted on trying to help the mitochondria when you're getting less light?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does spend more of the thyroid substance. But if you have your tissue well-saturated with safe nutrients rather than dangerous polyunsaturated oils, your mitochondria are much tougher. They've found that you can remove the mitochondria from an animal that hasn't had those unsaturated fats, and the mitochondria survive in the test tube much longer. It's the polyunsaturated fats that make the mitochondria susceptible to injury.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think this is because the lipid membrane of the mitochondria is made up of saturated oils that don't oxidize?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's mostly protein that gives the structure, and those proteins are tightly interacting with fats. If you get too many unsaturated ones, they oxidize and damage the proteins.

**Andrew Murray:** That reminds me of Otto Warburg's work. You mentioned that animals poisoned with carbon monoxide could recover if bright orange light was shined on them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Warburg was using tissues isolated from animals. The Russians were the ones who used whole animals. They would give them a killing dose of gamma rays, and if they flooded them with red light very quickly, it inactivated the effects of the radiation. It wasn't the radiation itself; it was a cascade of chemical events that could be interrupted by the red light. When you get sunburned, part of that cascade is the production of carbon monoxide.

## Caller: Polyunsaturated Fats in Meat

**Caller:** I wanted to go back to polyunsaturated fats. If they feed chickens or organic beef lots of grains, are we getting a secondary exposure to polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Any animal that isn't a ruminant will express in its tissues pretty exactly the balance of fats in its food. That includes people, pigs, chickens, ducks, and turkeys.

However, sheep, cows, and camels will produce milk where about 98% of the bad fats have been destroyed by bacteria in their rumens. It becomes 98% monounsaturated or saturated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That would include venison, elk, and moose.

**Caller:** But when you see chickens, they have such soft, almost runny fat these days.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right, because it's very polyunsaturated from eating corn and soy meal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same with pig fat. When my grandmother used it, it was a solid like butter. Most researchers have been calling it a saturated fat for 50 years, but a couple of years ago, someone analyzed it and found it was 30% PUFA.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had friends who butchered a pig fed mostly apples and vegetables. It was all solid fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the way to make good eggs too—feed them lots of vegetable matter.

## Caller: Butter and Heart Health

**Caller:** People tend to be really skittish about butter. I hear people say, "I mustn't eat butter because I'm afraid of the cholesterol and clogged arteries." Yet you guys say butter is good for you. What's with that?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's brainwashing. They wanted to sell margarine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A researcher in India noticed that in his area where people eat a lot of butter, alcoholics didn't get hepatitis and cirrhosis. He did a study with rats, feeding them butter and alcohol, and they didn't get liver disease. A group has been researching that for about 25 years, showing that fish oil and unsaturated vegetable oil interact with alcohol to activate iron, causing oxidative damage. If you have a practically unsaturated-fat-free diet, alcohol is pretty harmless.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, research has shown that if you're eating unsaturated fatty acids, those go rancid in your bloodstream and damage your arteries. Your body puts a cholesterol bandage over the rancid oil. Japanese scientists found that when they remove that cholesterol bandage, they find a plaque of oxidized omega-6 oils. Saturated fats are stable and would not create a free radical reaction like that.

**Caller:** So you're saying unsaturated fat will clog your arteries quicker than butter?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Exactly. When the seed oil industry was unable to sell their oils to paint companies (because paint companies switched to petroleum), they needed to market corn and soy oil to humans. That's when "Mr. Mazzola" would drink a cup of corn oil and say it lowers cholesterol. He unfortunately died at a young age of a heart attack. They boycotted tropical oils like coconut and palm and promoted corn oil.

**Caller:** What about olive oil?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Olive oil is only 10% polyunsaturated and 90% monounsaturated, so it won't block your arteries like other liquid oils. But you wouldn't want to use it in excessive amounts.

## Caller: The Dean Ornish Diet

**Caller:** I've had quintuple bypass surgery and was introduced to the Dean Ornish Diet. It claims saturated fat is no good at all. I'm confused.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a lot of stuff on the internet now. Chris Masterjohn has some very good review articles dealing with topics like that. I've got a couple of articles on cholesterol on my website.

**Andrew Murray:** Google Chris Masterjohn, and Dr. Peat's website is [RayPeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com).

## Caller: EMF Protection

**Caller:** I've been reading about black tourmaline or organite as being helpful against EMFs. What do you feel is protective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it takes something that is basically covering the space between you and the source geometrically. Something that is a small area, like a crystal, just can't catch a broad emission coming at you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They have "block socks" for cell phones with a metal barrier.

**Caller:** How do we protect ourselves from a laptop?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just think of it as light coming from your computer. If the light is touching an important part of your body, the microwaves are following the line of sight. You need something as big as the object emitting to catch the radiation. The lap is not a good place to keep a radiant source.

**Andrew Murray:** You could use an external keyboard and put the laptop underneath the table, or use an external monitor.

## Conclusion

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We could make a connection between the unsaturated fat and carbon monoxide. Fish oil happens to be one of the very best activators of heme oxygenase, which makes carbon monoxide. In proportion to how polyunsaturated the fat is, it activates the production of carbon monoxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if someone had Alzheimer's and they're taking fish oil, it's a really bad combination.

**Andrew Murray:** And that is the kind of thing the industry tells you is good for Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disorders. Bizarre.

**Station Staff:** We have one quick question about horse meat. Is that good or bad?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on what the horse is eating. It will reflect exactly what the horse ate. It's likely to be fairly unsaturated unless, for example, in some countries where they feed them dates.
