## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, they run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM. We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal supplements and dietary advice.

This month we want to reassess the role of sugar in the diet and why good sugars are essential for good health. It seems that many things we are told are bad for us are actually the good guys, and we need to see the facts and research that is out there. First, it was saturated animal fats; we were told they were hardening our arteries and leading us into an early grave. Not true. The polyunsaturated alternatives are actually damaging us and are the cause of many disorders. Then salt, which we were told was increasing our blood pressure. Again, not true. Salt is essential and regulates many processes, without which we suffer from increased adrenaline and stress hormones.

Now sugar is the "bad guy." Well, not true. So once again, we're excited to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us this month, and we'll be hearing from him on research-based facts behind the statement that sugar is good for you. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again. Would you first give the listeners a little bit about your background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 50s and 60s, I was studying and teaching in the humanities, but I spent a lot of time reading at the science library of the University of Oregon. I eventually decided to get a PhD in biology and physiology so I could use their laboratory equipment as well as their library. But I never really considered myself part of the academic scientific community. I just got what I could from their culture and have tried to see things that are useful rather than just abstract. That has meant that I concentrate on small molecules rather than genes and the big fancy molecules. So water, carbon dioxide, salt, calcium, sugar, and fats have been the things that I study most.

## Defining Good Sugar and Carbon Dioxide

**Andrew Murray:** Would you first qualify the term "good sugar" for our listeners? Then we'll get into the facts and figures surrounding sugar and why they're so important for us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar is really the ideal energy exchange substance. It's useful for practically all organisms, and it is something that we can store and use for building all of the big molecules. When it's metabolized, it releases carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is really a more universal substance than oxygen for the support of life.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You had told us in one of our previous shows that there are organisms who can live without oxygen, known as anaerobic organisms, but there are no organisms that can live without carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. It turns out that it isn't just mosquitoes, fleas, and bed bugs that are attracted to carbon dioxide. The flatworms and nematodes that they study as simple models of metabolism and aging seek out a fairly high concentration of carbon dioxide as more favorable for their living conditions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So as our cells use sugar more effectively, are we producing a larger amount of carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When we produce more carbon dioxide, that means we inhibit the production of lactic acid. Lactic acid is not only a wasteful way to use sugar, but it has a signal function that turns on a whole range of inflammatory processes. They have talked for decades about tumors producing lactic acid, but lactic acid also promotes tumors and all the inflammatory processes. So you want your sugar to metabolize into carbon dioxide, which will then prevent the dangerous overproduction of lactic acid.

## Lactic Acid and Fermented Foods

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can somebody overdose themselves on lactic acid from eating fermented cultured products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I got interested in that a long time ago when I found a nice kefir product that tasted good. I would drink a pint of it for lunch, and I came down with a migraine every time I did that. That caused me to read more about the metabolism of lactic acid. It is normally produced by stress. When you use your muscles faster than your lungs can keep the oxygen supply adequate, the lactic acid is circulated into your bloodstream and reaches the liver. Your liver has to spend extra energy to turn the lactic acid back into glucose, which it then sends back to the muscles. Meanwhile, it's depleting your liver of any stored glycogen just to get rid of the lactic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's wasting the sugar that your liver has stored as glycogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Because I probably was hypothyroid, I happened to be so sensitive that I got a migraine just from drinking a package of the kefir. Since then, I've run into quite a few people who were having various symptoms every time they ate a fermented product with lactic acid in it. The vinegar type fermentation is slightly toxic, but it doesn't participate in that blood sugar disturbing effect that lactic acid does.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's the probiotic bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the probiotic bacteria make lactic acid. In themselves, they can produce other substances that are protective, but you don't want them producing lactic acid from the sugar you eat. The sugar you eat should be absorbed in the first part of your intestine where there are no bacteria to speak of.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Or there shouldn't be.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. For various reasons, sometimes the bacteria will migrate up there from a sluggish bowel. Or, if you eat poorly digested materials like too many starches or fibrous mixtures of starch and carbohydrates, these things will not be absorbed. They will go down and feed the bacteria, and then the bacteria can make lactic acid and other worse toxins from them.

## Glycogen Storage and Stress Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** I think it's important to expand on the liver as a storage organ for glycogen. How much glycogen is the liver able to store? How long can people go with just eating proteins or not eating before their liver runs out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your thyroid and other hormones are in the right concentration, your liver should be able to store at least eight hours of glycogen. Everyone should be able to get through the night on the amount of glycogen in their liver without resorting to other sources of energy.

However, when your thyroid is a little low, or if your estrogen is too high, your liver sometimes can hardly store any glycogen. Typically, when your glycogen runs out, you send out a surge of adrenaline, which will squeeze the last little bit of glucose out of your liver. When your liver can't respond to the adrenaline anymore—the first sign of depleted glucose is feeling shaky and cold from the high adrenaline—you then resort to increased cortisol.

Cortisol begins breaking down your tissues, turning protein into fat and carbohydrate for energy. Under that extreme condition, when you've been out of glycogen long enough to run on cortisol for about a day, your thymus will be dissolved just in a few hours. When the quickly dissolved tissues such as the thymus are gone, your muscles will atrophy. People who fast for a week or two will usually lose more muscle weight than fat because of the very rapid conversion of protein into fuel under the influence of cortisol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So whenever you eat a big dose of protein without sugar to back it up, you're going to stimulate the secretion of insulin to dispose of the amino acids.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The insulin, which properly disposes of the amino acids, is going to lower any circulating glucose and tend to turn it into fat. As the glucose goes down, that will drive up your cortisol. Typically, a big protein meal will cause a huge surge of cortisol. Some people become supposedly diabetic or very hyperglycemic because they eat too much meat unaccompanied by sugar or carbohydrates.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's important to keep a balance between proteins and sugars.

**Andrew Murray:** We should always eat sugars with protein.

## Good Sugars vs. Bad Sugars (Starches)

**Andrew Murray:** Let's clarify the bad sugars versus the good sugars and what food sources they are in.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things that started me thinking about whether a person should follow the government's advice to eat a lot of starch—otherwise known as complex carbohydrates—was reading about it in the 70s. The government and the American Dietetics Association have been promoting the idea that complex carbohydrates have some advantage over sugars for almost 50 years.

I ran across Gerhard Volkheimer's research. He fed different mixtures of starch and water—corn starch, potato starch, and grains—to experimental mice. These starch grains are roughly the size of a cell, anywhere from 5 microns up to 100 microns. He found that with a chronic diet of frequent starch feedings, he could demonstrate particles of starch in their bloodstream just minutes after they ate it, and in all of their body fluids about an hour later. He found that the mice were prematurely aged. When he examined their organs, he found little nests of dead cells where one of these fairly large grains of starch was stuck in an arteriole, killing all of the cells downstream from that plugged-up point.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the starch granules were blocking the arterioles and starving the cells of nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. He tested it on his medical students. He found that about 30 minutes after you drank some of it, you can find starch grains in your veins. 45 minutes to an hour later, you find it in the urine, the bile, and even in the cerebrospinal fluid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this because people's intestines are out of balance, or just the nature of the starch granule size?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He assumed they are being forced between cells. People have a mechanical conception of the intestine wall, arteries, and capillaries, but it's actually more like a viscous fluid. Things can migrate through as if there was no absolute barrier.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat has mentioned starches as being the bad guys because they block arteries, but there are other things starches do.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the typical starch isn't digested, it goes down and feeds the bacteria. That's a really bad effect they've seen with these so-called "prebiotic" or "probiotic" semi-digestible starches. They have found that poorly digested starches cause behavioral changes in animals, making them anxious and aggressive from the fermentation in their intestine. Some of the products of bacterial action can tremendously increase endotoxins and cause inflammation of the intestine, liver, and eventually the whole body.

However, when a typical well-cooked starch *is* digested, it releases pure glucose. In my first physiology lab, the professor had us feed a dose of corn starch to lab rats. Ten minutes later, there was no trace of starch paste left; it had instantly been turned into glucose and absorbed. When you look at the glycemic index, starch tends to be near the top, very similar to pure glucose. That means you get a quick, powerful stimulation of insulin. The insulin does its work quickly of disposing of the glucose by turning it into fat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So whether you eat a meal that has pure protein or a meal with starch, the end game is the same: it drives up insulin, increases fat production, and doesn't store sugar in your liver effectively. What types of sugars are slow-release and stored in the liver as glycogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sucrose, glucose, fructose, and lactose are very good, well-metabolized sugars.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do those sugars feed bacteria in the lower intestine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, they are so quickly absorbed that usually they will be absorbed partly in your stomach and partly in the first foot or so of the intestine. The presence of fructose partly blocks the release of insulin and changes the effect of insulin so that it helps direct some of the glucose into the liver while blocking its storage as fat. So, you get a lower secretion of insulin, a lower stress effect, and a better glycogen storage effect from either sucrose, the mixture of glucose and fructose, or milk sugar (lactose). In the case of milk, the proteins and fat add to the slowing of the sugar effect.

## Recommended Sugar Intake and Sources

**Andrew Murray:** How many grams of sugar would you say is a good, healthy amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on your total caloric requirement. Some hypothyroid women can maintain their body weight on 700 or 800 calories a day. But if you have a healthy metabolism and can burn between 2,000 and 3,500 calories a day, then your carbohydrate requirement is going to be somewhere in the range of 180 grams to 350 grams.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to give our listeners an idea: one teaspoon of sugar contains 4 grams. In comparison, one cup of brown rice contains 41 grams of sugar, but the glycemic index of the rice is going to be a lot higher. You'll store the sugars from the rice as fat more than you would if you were eating the same amount of grams in white sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you get your sugars in the form of more natural foods rather than refined white sucrose, there are benefits. For example, orange juice is extremely rich in minerals compared to rice, pasta, or bread. Potassium, which is very abundant in all fruits, acts like insulin. So you don't have to secrete very much insulin for the same disposition of glucose. Orange juice also has helpful chemicals like naringin that help prevent inflammation.

In milk, besides the protein and fat slowing the absorption of lactose, the calcium powerfully stimulates energy metabolism, causing you to use your sugar more quickly and preventing it from being stored as fat. Milk drinkers generally tend to be much slimmer than non-milk drinkers largely because of this calcium effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So Dr. Peat, you've mentioned milk and orange juice. What about honey?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Honey is generally better than white sugar because it has some minerals, though not as much as fruits. It's probably the best refined sugar—bees refined it rather than a factory. Honey has been used as a food by all the high civilizations. I think there's good reason to think that sugar goes with high cultural development.

## Diabetes, The Randle Effect, and Polyunsaturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** What is the deal with the link between diabetes and sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The principle in physiology that explains it was proposed a few decades ago called the Randle effect or the Randle cycle. It refers to the fact that free fatty acids block the use of glucose by cells. This was demonstrated in hospitals when giving nutritional support to patients in the form of a soy oil emulsion. About 15 minutes after injecting this emulsified soy oil, people would get hyperglycemic.

When the fatty acids involved in blocking the sugar are *polyunsaturated*, they produce long-range damage. A group led by Fu demonstrated that the glycated proteins seen in diabetic people—which are usually blamed on glucose—are actually caused more powerfully by polyunsaturated fatty acids. Spontaneously oxidized polyunsaturated fats stick to the proteins. So, the free fatty acids not only block sugar use instantaneously (Randle effect), but they produce these advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) associated with diabetes and aging. The chronic effect of a high-fat diet, if the fat is predominantly unsaturated, produces diabetes and all the things that result from glycated proteins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in diabetes, people have high levels of free fatty acids blocking the sugar from getting into the cell. Doesn't that feedback to the system to tell the body to raise the blood sugar higher?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's a self-stimulating cycle. When you block the cells from using glucose, they call for more, and the liver obliges by making extra glucose. Diabetics often have very high lactic acid concentrations, showing that the glucose *is* getting into the cell, but it can't be used oxidatively because the fatty acids are blocking the respiratory system. So then lactic acid goes to the liver, which turns it into more glucose.

## Caller: Sugar and Sleepiness

**Caller:** If I eat a big bowl of cereal with a lot of sugar, then two hours later I get sleepy. What does that mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually it's the same effect that a person who has been hypothyroid experiences when they correct their thyroid. When your adrenaline is high, you're being stimulated; you are very alert and on edge. When you either correct your thyroid function or eat a lot of sugar, the sugar helps to lower adrenaline. Sugar and salt will both help to lower adrenaline, so they can both make you sleepy while they're present and circulating. People who have insomnia can often take care of the problem temporarily by taking some sugary and salty food at bedtime.

**Caller:** If a person is diabetic or pre-diabetic, is there a simple way to express what the good sugars and bad sugars are?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The definitions of diabetes and pre-diabetes have been created to sell insulin and drugs. They keep multiplying the definitions—Type 1, Type 2, Syndrome X, gestational diabetes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, the good types of sugars that are going to be more slow-release are the fruit sugars and honey. If they're eaten in combination with fat and protein, they won't require the pancreas to pump out a ton of insulin. Fruits and cheese are very safe things for diabetics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, fruits and cheese are very safe. I wrote a newsletter about an English doctor 150 years ago who noticed exactly that same thing, but it didn't catch on with the medical business. Since the government has been making recommendations to eat starches and polyunsaturated fats, the incidence of so-called diabetes has increased tremendously. In the long range, it's very important to avoid polyunsaturated fats to avoid diabetes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Avoiding vegetable oils: soy, canola, corn, safflower, sunflower, hemp seed, and fish oil.

## Caller: Grains and Food Combining

**Caller:** What about beans and whole grains, like whole grain brown rice or quinoa? Also, a lot of nutritional people claim there's a problem when you combine fruits with proteins and want you to separate them. But what you're saying seems to contradict that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's good to precede a big protein meal by maybe 15 or 20 minutes with fruits so that you get your liver stocked with some glycogen. That way, you don't respond so violently when you eat pure protein.

Regarding whole grains and legumes: they have more nutrients, but only a small amount of minerals compared to fruits. The germs do contain some valuable nutrients, but they also contain enough of the polyunsaturated fats that they go rancid. That was why refining was invented by the Chinese several thousand years ago; they found that the rancidity of the whole grains damaged the nutritional value.

**Caller:** So a good diet would be mostly fruit and protein, staying away from polyunsaturated oils and even the omega-3 oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The virtue of omega-3s is that they are a little less toxic in the sense of causing cancer than the omega-6s, but they tend to break down faster. Their main virtue therapeutically is as an anti-inflammatory agent, but the way they are anti-inflammatory is that their breakdown products interfere with the immune system. In the long run, they are suppressing your immune system, similar to cortisone.

## Caller: Sugar and Yeast Infections

**Caller:** I have a question regarding the role of sugar in yeast infections and systemic fungal infections. If a person has a systemic fungal infection, should they be avoiding sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things like the yeasts that cause infections love sugar. If someone has a very intense infestation in their stomach, eating sugar can actually make them drunk from the fermentation. But getting drunk on sugar is about the worst effect of the sugar metabolism by the yeast.

When you *starve* yeast, they tend to become invasive. If you have yeast living in your intestine—and they are attracted to estrogen—and you starve them of sugar, they put out filaments long enough to penetrate through cells like fingers reaching through your intestine walls looking for sugar. That starvation condition is what can make them invade your tissues rather than just living free in your intestine. It's only when they invade your tissues that they become deadly.

Correcting the thyroid and hormones is the basic thing. Topically, dusting with sulfur powder is a safe way to kill them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you are saying that if someone has an overgrowth, eating more sugar would feed the yeast and make them happier so they're less invasive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, actually.

**Andrew Murray:** What would you suggest as a treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The carrot salad. The carrot is indigestible and has antifungal, antibacterial chemicals in it. If you grate a carrot and put some olive oil or coconut oil and vinegar on it, it helps. Vinegar is a bacterial chemical; the acetic acid is the bacteria's way of killing fungus. The fatty acids of coconut oil and olive oil bind to the indigestible fiber of the carrot and are slowly released all the way down your intestine. They have a very profound, safe disinfecting action.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thank you so much. For those who would like to find out more about Dr. Ray Peat, his website is www.raypeat.com. He has a very informative website with scholarly research articles on salt, polyunsaturated fats, hormones, and cancer. Good night.
