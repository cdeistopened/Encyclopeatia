## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray, and Sarah will join us in the studio shortly. For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

We are very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who has recently published an article about the prevalent effects of radiation in the environment, how subjected we are to it on a daily basis, and how it is something to be aware of rather than accepting it as a normal fact of life. Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us. Would you explain your academic background in biology to the listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started graduate school as a specialist in nerve biology, but I felt that they weren't very scientific; they were dogmatic. I wandered around the various labs until I ran across the reproductive physiology people. They actually seemed to be getting information and thinking about how the organism works, whereas the nerve biology people were really just trying to develop a dogma. So, I did my dissertation on the aging of the reproductive system in mammals.

## The Dangers of Body Scanners and Radiation Theory

**Andrew Murray:** With particular relevance to your recent publication, I know there is controversy surrounding the full-body scanners that began rolling out around 2007. What is your opinion of these devices in terms of their potential for causing negative effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the situation is similar to the 1950s. The government was assuring the public that fallout from atomic bomb testing was completely harmless because of their way of explaining the biological effects. They are still promoting those theories. Even though this kind of X-ray examining is much less dangerous than the radioactive isotopes falling out of bomb tests, the science by which they assure us of its safety is exactly as faulty as it was in the 1950s.

John Gofman, who was a government defender of the safety of radioactive isotopes during the 50s, suddenly realized that if the effects are going to be disastrous in the future, it's better to learn about the dangers now rather than wait until we're all dead.

The trick they've been using for almost 100 years is based on early 20th-century findings. People knew you could cause mutations with radiation or toxic chemicals. By the 1920s, people saw genetic changes as being entirely in the chromosomes. As chromosomes were seen to be in the DNA, the doctrine focused on the interaction of radiation with DNA.

However, in the 1960s, people demonstrated that if you do microsurgery on a protozoan and change the orientation of its cilia, its offspring will have backward cilia for generations.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's like a biological memory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and totally separate from the DNA. The frog biologist Gurdon showed that surgery on the surface of a frog egg could cause the whole line of frogs to die out generations later. Even though that egg would mature into an adult that could reproduce, eventually, the line would die out just from treating the surface of the egg. He showed that if you heat a spot on the surface, you will get mutations. It showed that some harmful influence other than direct interaction with DNA is able to eventually cause mutations and death.

**Andrew Murray:** Do we know what is actually transferred several generations down the line?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not really, just some good guesses. A researcher in Hungary named György Csaba has been working on what happens with these early life experiences that are passed on from cell to cell and even from an adult to its offspring.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the whole-body scanners in airports, they tell us they are safe. What are the potential risks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For 70 or 80 years, people have noticed that X-rays, even in moderate doses, seem to accelerate the aging process. The idea of imprinting is that you might get acceleration of the aging process from generation to generation if that is passed on the way other cytoplasmic injuries are.

Many people insisted that the aging process was the result of accumulating mutations. However, someone used a chemical mutagen to produce more mutations than X-ray treatment was producing, and the mice lived just as long as normal mice. But the X-rays, producing even fewer mutations, shortened their life. So it's a physiological effect. Mutations are much less deadly than whatever this other cytoplasmic or general physiological process is.

## Ionizing vs. Non-Ionizing Radiation

**Andrew Murray:** They tell us there is a difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. What do you say to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All kinds of electromagnetic radiation interact with matter. Light bounces off something, is absorbed in our retina, and we see things. That light causes a certain amount of electronic excitation. If you use a blue light rather than a full spectrum centered on yellow, the excitation of the electrons is enough to damage mitochondrial energy production. They've seen this for 50 or 60 years growing plants under different colored lights. If you put a plant that thrives in sunlight in pure blue light, the mitochondria are damaged almost as if they were irradiated with X-rays. But when you add back the rest of the spectrum, there's something about the red light that neutralizes the toxic effect of the blue light.

If you put a piece of glass in the desert for many years, it turns purple. With a given energy of radiation, you can bleach that purple out. Electrons are excited by energetic radiation and get trapped. When you shine just the right energy, like red light, you can move an electron out of its trap and restore it to its normal position.

This works in biology too. People who have burned their retina with ultraviolet light can prevent the burning if they get red light soon enough. You can demonstrate this in seeds or hair. So, the excitation and moving of electrons isn't strictly an X-ray or gamma ray phenomenon. However, when you get up to ultraviolet and higher, the main effect is that the electrons get completely knocked out of the system. That constitutes ionization. You actually have some degree of ionization even from blue light.

**Andrew Murray:** And the non-ionizing type doesn't have the energy to displace electrons?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You get very similar chemical effects from ultraviolet and X-rays. The difference is that ultraviolet light is absorbed just a few millimeters into your skin, but you get the same kind of damage to the skin cells that you get to your heart and brain cells from X-rays. It's a very similar biological damage, except the very high-energy radiation goes right through you and affects all your cells.

## Red Light Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned red light can calm down the excitation of electrons, which is behind free radicals, tissue destruction, and cancer. So red light is extremely healing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The most surprising experiment was a Russian study where they gave a lethal dose of gamma rays to frogs. The dose was so intense the frogs would only live a few days. But if they shined bright red light on them within the first hour after exposure, they didn't get sick at all.

**Andrew Murray:** Are we talking about infrared or just red light?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Red light. In an ordinary incandescent bulb, the red end is a lot more intense than the blue and green end because the temperature of the bulb isn't nearly as hot as sunlight.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If somebody has been exposed to an X-ray, what would you recommend they sit under?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can do it very quickly, within the first hour, you can almost completely block the chain of events. However, people exposed to Chernobyl or the Nagasaki bombing still have toxic blood serum decades later. It acts like a systemic dose of estrogen to irradiate any part of the body. The lingering inflammation from exposure a long time ago probably could be affected slightly, even years later, by getting a very intense exposure to penetrating red light.

**Andrew:** How far into the skin does red light penetrate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago, I made a paddle with about a hundred red light-emitting diodes (LEDs). I let my eyes adapt to the darkness and put this paddle under my thigh. I could see the bone silhouette. The light was enough to go entirely through my thigh, showing a shadow for the femur.

**Andrew Murray:** So it penetrates deeply enough to potentially quench excitatory damage within the bone marrow?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I could see the thickening of the cortex of the bone as a dark shadow, so it was definitely going right through the marrow.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you were to advise someone to purchase a light bulb, what type would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a clear front bulb. They make them designed to run on 130 volts. When you run them on a standard 120-volt circuit, they aren't as blue-biased as ordinary incandescent bulbs. They are much weaker in the blue and stronger in the red. They appear as a yellowish-white, warmer than standard bulbs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So a 130-volt clear front incandescent. What wattage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They come in 150 to 250 watts.

## Estrogen, Radiation, and the Bystander Effect

**Andrew Murray:** There is a link where the liver's ability to metabolize waste products can be severely influenced by both estrogen and radiation. What are the consequences of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The most intense, visible first thing is that both estrogen and radiation interfere with mitochondrial energy production. That is associated with inflammation and adaptive lactic acid production. As carbon dioxide production goes down, lactic acid goes up, and lactic acid triggers inflammatory mediators.

In experiments, when you irradiate one cell, it emits inflammatory mediators that affect other cells in the same dish. It's a chemical that goes into the cell's environment and causes mutations, inflammation, and degeneration in other cells. That's what happens when your foot is irradiated; the fluids escaping those damaged cells circulate throughout your body.

**Andrew Murray:** I read about the "bystander effect," where fish exposed to radiation could affect other fish in the same water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They've been able to block that by using antagonists to serotonin. Serotonin itself contributes to fibrosis and impaired energy production.

**Andrew Murray:** People in this country are encouraged to use serotonin supplements for mood and sleep. That seems erroneous.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The whole system relating to serotonin is problematic. It's made from tryptophan, and tryptophan has some of the bad effects of serotonin. Tryptophan also happens to be probably the most sensitive amino acid to absorbing radiation. When the lens of the eye is injured by ultraviolet light, it's largely the tryptophan absorbing that energy.

## Diet: Meat and Gelatin

**Andrew Murray:** So consuming a lot of meat isn't a good idea because of the tryptophan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Adults have a very low requirement for tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How many ounces of meat product do you think is a safe limit per day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments with animals show they live 30% to 40% longer when they are almost completely lacking methionine. Similar effects are seen with tryptophan. These are the anti-metabolic amino acids. Some rat experiments suggest that maybe just an ounce or two of meat would be safe. Gelatin, which lacks those amino acids, is safe in very large amounts. Poor people who eat the tough bits of the animal—chicken feet and wings—get more gelatin than rich people who eat the tender steaks.

## Listener Q: Sunlight vs. Tanning Beds

**Engineer:** A listener asks: Is natural sunlight better to tan by than tanning beds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because you're absorbing light all the way through your body from sunlight. It increases your energy in your liver and brain. Everything is being refreshed. The general saturation with the red light in sunlight protects you to a great extent against the systemic "bystander" stuff seeping out of damaged skin.

**Engineer:** Is near-infrared beneficial too, like sitting by a wood stove?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It mostly just warms you. Keeping your core body temperature close to 99 degrees activates your respiration and protective processes.

## Listener Q: Grow Lights

**Engineer:** A caller asks about the benefits of grow lights for plants.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The red fraction is used for making energy, but if you grow most plants under pure red light, they grow extremely fast but are very weak and tend to fall over. They need some irritation to build the cellulose skeleton for strength. The typical grow light has red, blue, and a little ultraviolet to irritate the cells enough to produce cellulose. The irritating frequencies tend to make crops rich in defensive chemicals, which makes them bitter, but those defensive substances are often antioxidants for humans.

## Listener Q: Dental X-Rays & Antidepressants

**Caller:** I just had a bunch of dental X-rays, and two days later my back got really insecure. I was interested to hear that you can be irradiated in one place and it causes inflammation elsewhere.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A study in Seattle measured responses to standard dental X-rays where they used lead aprons to shield the body. Women who were pregnant when they got mouth X-rays had smaller babies than women who weren't exposed, even though the baby was shielded. It was the systemic stress or estrogen-like illness effect that caused the embryo to grow at a slower rate.

**Caller:** I have been taking Prozac for more than 20 years. I'd like to get off it. They always say you need serotonin. What is that doing to my body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several studies show that when thyroid is added to antidepressants that aren't working, they start to work. But drug companies never test thyroid by itself.

Regarding antidepressants: In the 50s, it was monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Then came tricyclic antidepressants, but those turned out to increase prolactin, which causes bone loss. Now we have SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), but serotonin is now turning out to cause bone loss too, by raising prolactin. Some comparative studies found the old 1950s style is actually safer than the newer ones.

**Caller:** So is taking something for thyroid a better way to go?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That would be my choice. One of the most interesting recent antidepressants actually has the opposite effect—it *increases* the reuptake of serotonin, just the opposite of the currently popular ones, and it is very effective.

## Listener Q: Bone Health & Hepatitis C

**Caller:** I am a 64-year-old woman with "100-year-old bones." I've been doing Forteo injections for three months. I've had 17 X-rays in the last week and am headed for an MRI and CT scan. I also have Hepatitis C. What effects could this have?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably the safest, most effective thing is getting lots of calcium in your diet and adequate magnesium. Vitamin K is very safe and complements Vitamin D and calcium.

Exposure to radiation knocks down energy production and causes cells to take up too much calcium into the soft tissue. Gofman demonstrated that a tremendous amount of heart disease is caused by radiation exposure because calcium goes into soft tissue rather than bones. Vitamin K can reverse the calcification of arteries while accelerating the repair of bones.

**Caller:** Would that replace the Forteo injections? It's Teriparatide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin K is very important for energy production and calcium deposition. I haven't heard of that specific drug.

**Andrew Murray:** Vitamin K, calcium, and Vitamin D are the most important things Dr. Peat mentioned. Also, make sure your thyroid is working optimally.

**Caller:** What can I replace blood pressure medicine with?

**Andrew Murray:** Traditional herbs include Hawthorne flowers and berries. They are cardiotonic—they decrease the rate but increase the force of contraction. Valerian can also help by reducing stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even with Hepatitis C, calcium and Vitamin K should help blood pressure.

**Andrew Murray:** For Hepatitis, avoid polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). They are implicated in inflammation. Increase gelatin consumption and get good proteins.

## Listener Q: Smart Meters & WiFi

**Caller:** I've read that non-ionizing radiation can cause cellular damage. I'm concerned about the new PG&E Smart Meters and WiFi.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some relatively low-energy radiation can still break chromosomes; it's a matter of how they resonate. For example, men working around power lines have very few male offspring, and birds living near those lines have almost purely female offspring because of cellular and chromosome damage from those low-frequency emissions.

**Caller:** Do you know anything about the frequencies of Smart Meters and WiFi?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have a gauge that I check things with. I went to a flat-screen monitor years ago and use only wire connections. Even with new microwave ovens, it's good to stand back three or four feet because they have intense fields.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you recommend people buy an EMF meter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think they cost about $20.

**Andrew Murray:** Wherever possible, hardwire your internet connection to your computers rather than using WiFi.

## Listener Q: 5-HTP & Serotonin

**Caller:** I take a supplement called 5-HTP. Does that fall into the benign or bad category?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many of its effects are essentially the same as serotonin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Serotonin stimulates cell growth and inflammation. It can increase the growth of plaques in arteries and accelerate tumor growth. Tryptophan, which isn't quite as active as 5-HTP, is considered to be slightly carcinogenic in excess.

**Caller:** That's odd, I'm struggling with healing tendons and taking this at the same time.

**Andrew Murray:** For tendons, one of the best things is Dr. Peat's recommendation of a bone broth or gelatin broth. Gelatin is anti-inflammatory and provides components used in the formation of tendons.

## Listener Q: Best Meats for Weight Loss

**Caller:** I'm looking to lose weight. Is there any meat that is better than others?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoid pork and non-ruminants because those reflect whatever they ate and are usually highly unsaturated and anti-thyroid. Beef and lamb are saturated.

**Caller:** Do you recommend turkey?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Turkey usually eats the same stuff chickens and pigs do—corn and soybeans.
