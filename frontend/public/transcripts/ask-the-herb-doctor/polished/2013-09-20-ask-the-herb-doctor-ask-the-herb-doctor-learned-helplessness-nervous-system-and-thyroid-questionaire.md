## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome once again to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. My wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herb extracts.

You are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of learned helplessness, the nervous system, and a generalized thyroid questionnaire. We are very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat to share his wisdom with us. Dr. Peat, for those who have never heard you, would you please give an outline of your academic background in biology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied mostly at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. I did my PhD dissertation on reproductive aging and how the physiology of oxidative metabolism changes with aging and interacts with changes in all of the hormones. Since then, I have been developing some of the central ideas that were involved in both aging and reproduction.

## The Nervous System: Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic

**Andrew Murray:** I think tonight's introduction regarding the nervous system has some fairly new ideas attached to it. Before we get into the subject, could you discuss briefly the two known arms of the nervous system, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The general way doctors still think about them is based on a set of ideas established just about 100 years ago, with opposition between the relaxing side and the mobilizing emergency side. That has tended to be called the "fight or flight" reaction for the sympathetic nervous system, which is based largely on adrenaline. The relaxing parasympathetic side is based mostly on acetylcholine.

In the last 30 or 40 years, a lot of complexity has turned up, even though in a general sense those oppositions are still accurate. It turns out there is a lot of overlap. Each part of the nervous system does things that can also be done by the other side, and each one has more repertoire than just adrenaline or acetylcholine. They can interact in various ways with serotonin, histamine, and so on.

The 100-year-old idea is that the relaxing side [parasympathetic] takes care of peristalsis and secretion largely. It slows the heart rate for relaxation and weakens the strength of the heart contraction, but it strengthens the peristalsis movement of the intestine and wall of the bladder and stimulates secretion of a lot of glands. It relaxes the sphincters of the intestine, bladder, and gallbladder so that it goes with secretion, digestion, and excretion—all of the basically vegetative processes.

**Andrew Murray:** So the parasympathetic nervous system is all about what happens after you eat a meal. You relax, you digest your food, your heart rate slows down. You always think of the parasympathetics being fairly peaceful and "wet," if you like.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And it tends to take over at night. It helps a person go to sleep by slowing the heart rate. But with problems such as diabetes, hypoglycemia, or various metabolic disorders, it can get overactive. Instead of just calming things down, slowing the metabolism, and lowering blood sugar because you don't need so much, it can cause too much insulin secretion and other glandular secretions—for example, causing too much mucus formation. The increased insulin can lower your blood sugar too much, and that can lead to intensified activity of the nerves, intensifying both contraction and relaxation where it shouldn't be happening.

## Learned Helplessness and Excitotoxicity

**Andrew Murray:** In light of what we understand about the sympathetics and parasympathetics under the effects of stress, you've written about the stress-induced excitotoxic effects of the parasympathetics. Could you describe that a little more?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The place that it started to be understood was in the learned helplessness situation. They saw that when an animal believed it couldn't escape from a stressful situation, its heart slowed down instead of accelerating. The very same signal that would make an animal's heart race if it was wandering around freely and had the possibility of escaping, if it was in a trapped situation, its heart would slow down. Given a little too much stress and threat, its heart would actually stop in a relaxed position. Without that belief in the impossibility of escape, it would go on struggling for days—swimming in a tank, for example—whereas with the expectation that it wouldn't be able to escape, it might drown in five or six minutes.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow. So this is the rationale for hope being something that can keep a person alive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly. In the 1950s, a biologist shocked a lot of other biologists by talking about the rat's hopelessness causing death.

## Alzheimer’s Disease and Treatment

**Andrew Murray:** I know you mentioned how the standard treatment for Alzheimer's is actually pretty bad science in terms of what's understood now about the two arms of the nervous system, and how the drugs they're currently using might be making it worse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain processes that allow learning and intelligent behavior involve the cholinergic nerves of the brain. Several types of evidence made doctors concentrate on the loss of the cholinergic system. If you stimulate the cholinergic nerves, you can improve learning and behavior. But if you aren't increasing energy to keep up with that increased stimulation, you put the cell in a stress between having to work harder but not having the fuel to do it.

If your cortisol is high, interfering with your ability to use sugar, or if your blood sugar is simply low and you're being stimulated, then the cell tends to die. The reasoning that Alzheimer's disease was simply a wasting away of the cholinergic nerves led to treating it for the first 10 or 15 years just with chemicals to increase excitation of the cholinergic nerves. That wasn't working at all. People were dying at a higher rate of liver disease and such.

From the 1950s, people were already suggesting treating dementia and other brain degenerative diseases with atropine and other chemicals that *block* the cholinergic nerves. Amantadine, which is now used for treating Parkinson's disease, was one of the chemicals considered anticholinergic in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Since people were seeing actual improvement with the anticholinergic chemicals, they reclassified them as acting against another excitatory nervous system—the system that causes glutamate or MSG nerve toxicity. So they now call it an anti-NMDA chemical. Memantine is very similar to amantadine. It is a chemical which used to be called anticholinergic that's being used for both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. But they still go on with the doctrine that they have to stimulate the cholinergic system too, even though that has never shown improvement.

## Estrogen, Nitric Oxide, and Thyroid

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask you about estrogen. We've talked about how the revelations are that estrogen is extremely damaging. How do you look at estrogen and its destructive features?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of people by now have heard that there's a premenstrual-related epilepsy that results from an excess of estrogen in relation to progesterone, because estrogen is excitatory while progesterone is calming. It happens that estrogen intensifies the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system, while progesterone tends to relax that. You can see that parasympathetic function of estrogen in the uterus. If there's too much estrogen in pregnancy, it will cause strong contractions of the uterus and can cause miscarriage.

For about 50 years, there was a puzzle about how acetylcholine could inhibit the heart and the sphincters while causing contractions of the various ducts and intestine. The main thing that happens is that acetylcholine causes cells to produce nitric oxide—the chemical that became famous with Viagra—which causes vasodilation.

**Andrew Murray:** People also abuse nitrous oxide, don't they?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a different chemical; that's actually just an anesthetic. Nitric oxide is the free radical that you find in smog, and it's produced by any cell that's excited too strongly. In the situation where the cholinergic stimulation is causing relaxation in blood vessels, it's acting by way of increased nitric oxide. What the nitric oxide is doing is blocking energy production. So the smooth muscle of the blood vessel or sphincter simply doesn't have the energy to contract. It actually steals oxygen from the mitochondrion and blocks the use of any oxygen that's there. Estrogen happens to activate the enzyme that forms nitric oxide. So it works with the cholinergic system, and both of them act partly through increasing the amount of nitric oxide. Progesterone, with its quieting effect, inhibits the enzyme that forms nitric oxide.

**Andrew Murray:** In the presence of adequate metabolic energy in the form of sufficient thyroid, would nitric oxide still be able to do this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. In situations where they were studying learned helplessness, which produces increased acetylcholine and nitric oxide, they found that either progesterone or thyroid (T3) would block the formation of that behavior and keep them from dying prematurely. Thyroid and progesterone both interfere with the production of nitric oxide.

In situations of under-function of the thyroid gland, it's now pretty well established that high blood pressure is produced by hypothyroidism. Because of the belief that nitric oxide has a beneficial effect of increasing circulation, the thought was that hypothyroidism must be lowering nitric oxide. But in fact, it increases it while still causing contraction of the blood vessels and increasing blood pressure. So the effect of thyroid is to stop excess nitric oxide.

Some of the changes with aging—high blood pressure, incontinence, edema, constipation, leakiness of blood vessels—are all able to be produced and relieved by either increasing or decreasing the amount of nitric oxide in the system. An excess of the cholinergic function leading to overproduction of nitric oxide will cause constipation, incontinence, and swelling of the feet—just about all of the typical symptoms of aging, stress, and shock.

## DHEA and Aromatase

**Andrew Murray:** I had a question regarding DHEA. A bottle of DHEA gave a warning about possibly increasing estrogen. Is it true that estrogen would be produced in a person taking DHEA if they were under stress, but not if they had adequate thyroid and progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. DHEA and progesterone both will break the learned helplessness pattern of too much nitric oxide. But what causes DHEA and testosterone to be turned into estrogen excessively is anything causing stress, irritation, or inflammation. The enzyme that makes estrogen—aromatase—is activated by anything that stresses cells. The processes that are reversed by thyroid and progesterone are activated by, for example, prostaglandins, which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Prostaglandins synergize with estrogen in many ways. They activate the formation of estrogen. Progesterone, thyroid, and aspirin will turn off aromatase by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme that makes polyunsaturated fats turn into prostaglandins.

## Caller: Seizures and Diet

**Jackie:** I have a premenstrual seizure problem. I have a grand mal seizure once a month, and I have a real memory problem because of that. I'm wondering, how do you promote the production of more thyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an emergency situation, you can have a good probability of either stopping or reducing the severity of seizures just with progesterone. But in the long run, you want to stop the intake of the polyunsaturated fats that activate estrogen and inhibit thyroid. The degree of unsaturation of the fat corresponds to the degree of interference with thyroid hormone. So fish oil is more anti-thyroid than the seed oils. Olive oil is very weakly anti-thyroid. Butter, coconut oil, cream, beef, and lamb fat are not anti-thyroid.

Traditional diets before 1940, even in the industrial countries, included quite a bit of thyroid in the food. If you stewed a chicken or a fish, the thyroid would break up and be consumed. With that traditional diet, a person probably averaged the equivalent of maybe 30 milligrams a day of Armour Thyroid. The removal of natural thyroid from the food supply has contributed to hypothyroidism, resulting in high estrogen. At the same time, the diet has been industrialized to include lots of these seed oils which are both pro-estrogen and anti-thyroid.

**Jackie:** I've been using dandelion root to deal with water retention. My source for progesterone is chaste tree berries (Vitex). I am under the impression that over time it can help rebalance my hormonal imbalance.

**Andrew Murray:** Vitex has traditionally been a progestogenic, used to reduce symptoms of high estrogen like edema and PMS. Just briefly, dandelion root is actually a cholagogue (bile stimulant), while the leaf is specifically a diuretic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The minerals are very important too for getting the balance of the nervous system. Make sure you have enough of all the alkaline minerals: potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Fruit and milk are very important for those.

**Jackie:** I tried a vegan diet and depleted all my minerals. I was regularly diagnosed with low sodium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Decaf coffee is fine as a source of niacin and magnesium. Another good source of minerals, especially magnesium, is well-cooked green leaves. Undercooked greens aren't digestible and can actually increase your inflammatory nitric oxide. Irritation of the intestine from starchy, undercooked vegetable matter will increase the nitric oxide that causes water retention. It causes the intestine to suck up water but causes the kidneys to lose sodium.

First aid is just to get your minerals up. Resuscitation can be done efficiently with an extremely hyper-osmotic, concentrated mineral solution (sodium chloride). Just injecting a small amount can bring a person out of shock because it inhibits the formation of nitric oxide, helps the kidneys retain sodium, and starts the system producing energy.

## Caller: Societal Helplessness and Raw Eggs

**David:** I'm looking at what's going on in the world right now—NSA, potential war in Syria—and the government engagement in these things. Do you think about learned helplessness in terms of humanity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, that was exactly why I decided to write this newsletter right now. I've been following the research since 1960. It has been actual government policy since the late 1940s to manipulate the mass media to create helplessness in the population.

**David:** It's almost like we're lacking intelligence and creativity, which I know you talk about a lot.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In one of the studies in which rats had been taught learned helplessness so they would drown in five or six minutes, just being able to see another rat escape would let the informed rat go for days without drowning. Just the recognition that someone else did it can make all the difference.

**David:** I raise my own chickens. Is there a benefit to eating eggs raw versus lightly cooking them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In moderate amounts, even raw eggs are fine. They are very digestible and antiseptic in the raw state. They've seen the raw egg yolk kill viruses that other related chemicals weren't able to destroy.

**David:** Is there a benefit to eating raw eggs over cooking them regarding the fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the chickens were fed a more saturated diet like they used to be—with orchard waste, apples, and whey—then the egg fat is much safer. In the raw state, it has that germicidal effect. I've known several people who cured their leukemia by drinking eggnogs, fruit juice, and raw eggs.

**David:** What about raw milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can find really good milk, it's slightly better in the raw state. If you have really good milk, it's okay to pasteurize it, but it's slightly better raw.

## Caller: 5-HTP and Serotonin

**Pat:** I had a question about 5-HTP. Do you think it's safe to take as a supplement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. It does tend to increase serotonin, and serotonin, like histamine, can increase nitric oxide and set those inflammatory processes in motion. Any form of tryptophan tends to increase serotonin, and serotonin tends to increase those inflammatory things, estrogen and nitric oxide.

## Thyroid and Blood Pressure

**Andrew Murray:** People think about thyroid hormone as being a stimulant and worry they will get high blood pressure if they take it. I know it's not true, but would you explain that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hypothyroid people have increased nitric oxide, but at the same time, they have a tendency of too much contraction of the blood vessels and high blood pressure. The basic thing that relaxes the blood vessels produced by thyroid hormone is carbon dioxide. Hypothyroid people tend to have chronically increased lactic acid in their blood, which displaces carbon dioxide.

Carbon dioxide relaxes blood vessels in a very different way than nitric oxide does. Nitric oxide interferes with energy supply. Carbon dioxide retains a high energy level while relaxing, partly by changing the electrical pH behavior of the cell. It acidifies the cell, which relaxes it. That relaxing effect allows blood to flow through, providing oxygen to the tissues.

Carbon dioxide and thyroid both tend to increase the stroke volume of the heart, the same way progesterone does. Where the parasympathetic nervous system and estrogen decrease the stroke volume and weaken the heart, thyroid has an energizing but relaxing function. It increases the ability of cells to retain magnesium because magnesium is bound to the ATP energy-carrying molecule. By increasing the oxidation of the cell to produce ATP, the cell then binds magnesium and releases calcium, which is the excitatory thing.

## Caller: Sound Healing

**Caller:** There's a Dr. Horowitz who claims that listening to sounds at 528 Hz will heal DNA. What is your understanding of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good person to read on that issue would be Harold Hillman. Russian research in the early 70s showed that certain musical tones would cause muscle to increase its ATP production. That was disregarded because the level of the energy in a given vibration was considered too small to exceed the thermal agitation of the molecules. But actually, the muscle is organized with long-range structures in the water which form, in effect, an antenna that can receive sound waves of these very low energies. So it's physically very plausible.

## Thyroid and Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** We have a few minutes left. Can you give a quick breakdown of how cholesterol is controlled by thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, graphs were published showing that when a person's thyroid gland was removed, as their metabolic rate declined, the blood cholesterol increased. When they were given a supplement of thyroid, it was a mirror image: as the metabolic rate increased, the cholesterol declined. This allowed many doctors to diagnose hypothyroidism simply by looking at elevated cholesterol.

When the essential fatty acid lowering of cholesterol and drugs to lower cholesterol came on the scene, the connection between thyroid and cholesterol was discouraged because it was too simple to correct high cholesterol just by correcting the thyroid function. How it works is that thyroid activates the conversion of cholesterol to primarily pregnenolone and progesterone. That was demonstrated by pumping blood into an ovary and measuring the amount of cholesterol going in and the amount of progesterone coming out. If they decreased the cholesterol in the blood, the ovary produced less progesterone.

**Andrew Murray:** Excellent. Thanks so much for your time again, Dr. Peat. For more information, you can visit www.raypeat.com.
