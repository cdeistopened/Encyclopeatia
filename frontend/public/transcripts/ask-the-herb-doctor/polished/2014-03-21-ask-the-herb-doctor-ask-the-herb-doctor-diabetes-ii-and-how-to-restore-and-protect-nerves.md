## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. My wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists. We trained in England, graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine, and we now run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of how to restore and protect nerves. We're very privileged to have Dr. Raymond Peat and his expertise joining us again this evening. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who have never heard of you or your areas of expertise, would you outline your academic and professional background before we get started on tonight's show?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Relative to nerve biology, that was my intended major when I went to the University of Oregon as a graduate student in 1968 because I had been interested in linguistics and psychology. But as soon as I got there, within two or three months, I decided to switch to aging and reproductive physiology because of the great dogmatism in the nerve biology field. So I spent three or four years working on female reproductive aging in particular. I concentrated on the effects of estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, oxygen, and antioxidants on the age-related changes in metabolism.

**Andrew Murray:** And for the last 40 years, you've been doing your own research and consulting. A lot of what you've spoken about in the past has been fairly controversial. In my education in herbal medicine, the same dogmatic and erroneous ideas in science were perpetrated. A lot of what you've been uncovering has certainly got me thinking differently.

## Diabetes and Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** I want to start by saying that the classical description of diabetes was a wasting disease where excess glucose is lost in the urine as a byproduct of protein metabolism, and the patient simply wastes away. Now, obesity is a universal disease, and obese diabetics are common. Medicine now classes diabetes as insulin resistance as well as insulin dependence. Would you explain the processes that you understand diabetes to stem from and outline your approach to its management?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My father happened to be an example of the traditional, original type of diabetes. He wasted away to under 100 pounds. It was just a few years after insulin had come into medical use, and he didn't want to become dependent on it. My mother looked through the old naturopathic medical literature and found that brewer's yeast had sometimes cured people. He went on a brewer's yeast diet for several weeks, recovered his weight, and lived the rest of his life with no sign of diabetes.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know how much brewer's yeast he was using?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was his only food, basically, for several weeks.

**Andrew Murray:** I know the B vitamins are the important part of brewer's yeast, but what specifically helped?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are steroids in it, a lot of potassium, and phosphate. Phosphate is not for general health—you can very easily get phosphate poisoning—but probably it's one of the factors that could be involved in that effect, maybe by interfering with stress hormones.

**Andrew Murray:** So your father recovered from wasting away using brewer's yeast.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I think there are probably many causes of the traditional wasting form of diabetes. A virus is one plausible theory that can cause inflammation and the temporary killing off of insulin-producing cells. But also just very intense stress. There were experiments in which if part of a dog's pancreas was removed, leaving a smaller reserve of insulin-producing cells, a single injection of a large dose of cortisol was enough to make the dog permanently diabetic.

**Andrew Murray:** So that extreme stress caused by cortisol itself is an inflammatory mediator.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Once the tissues are unable to get glucose just from that one episode of stress-induced lack of insulin, the cells are basically dying because they can't get the glucose they need. So they call on fatty acids from stores, and the fatty acids, in turn, kill the remaining or regenerating insulin-producing cells. So it starts a vicious circle.

## Fatty Acids and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Just in case listeners don't understand what a fatty acid or a free fatty acid is, would you explain what they are and how they're used?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A fat, such as butter, lard, or corn oil, mostly consists of about 18 carbon atoms in a chain with oxygens on one end making it acidic. If the hydrogens are removed, that's called an unsaturated fatty acid. Those chains are attached to a glycerin molecule. When the glycerin is combined with three fatty acids, it becomes very water-insoluble. That is the form in which it's stored in the fat cells.

When you need energy, you have to activate enzymes that break the free fatty acids loose. When that happens from stress, hunger, or fasting, these free fatty acids get into the bloodstream, enter cells, and are available for energy production in the absence of glucose. The trouble is that process also tends to keep the stress going. If the free fatty acids are unsaturated—and especially if they are polyunsaturated, like from corn oil or safflower oil—those have a further stress-inducing action that tends to keep the breakdown of fat going and the stress reproducing itself.

**Andrew Murray:** If somebody is consuming a lot of butter, milk, and coconut oil, the fats therein, when stored, don't have the same destructive or oxidative effects when liberated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. If you store a very saturated fat—like ghee or coconut oil, which is 98% saturated—those things keep for years without breaking down. But if you leave a bottle of safflower, corn, or linseed oil open, within hours or days you can detect spontaneous oxidation in the air. That happens at body temperature with the high oxygen content of your blood.

Interestingly, the biological oxidation is pretty much the opposite. If you have saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids circulating in your bloodstream, your muscles will be able to oxidize the saturated fat preferentially. The polyunsaturated fat tends to go into storage if you ate more than you can oxidize. So, it tends to be fattening if you eat a little extra of the polyunsaturated because it stores more easily. Your fat cells can also oxidize saturated fat, so they live on the saturated fat they have stored. Over the years, stress is more likely to release the polyunsaturated fats, making stress an increasing problem with age.

**Andrew Murray:** So the obesity we see now, which is generically termed diabetes, is probably directly linked to the polyunsaturated, thyroid-suppressive diets people consume.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's now increasingly seen as a fat inflammation condition—a mild chronic inflammation. A major thing that causes that is the continual spontaneous release of small amounts of arachidonic acid. This is a highly unsaturated fatty acid that, even if you don't eat it, enzymes in the body will create from linoleic acid. It becomes one of the most toxic stored fats. When released, it turns into prostaglandins, which are probably our biggest inflammatory problem.

**Andrew Murray:** And prostaglandins are associated with inflammation, swelling, and edema.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. They're why aspirin is so great.

## Aspirin and Niacinamide

**Andrew Murray:** How do you approach diabetes management?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you focus on stopping the liberation of fatty acids from your tissues and inhibit their conversion to prostaglandins, you can usually very quickly lower your blood sugar quite a bit and feel better. The two chemicals that are most practical for lowering free fatty acids and stopping the stress reaction are niacinamide and aspirin.

Niacinamide has many effects, but the first one is inhibiting the lipase that liberates fats from your fat stores. Aspirin also does that, along with several other things relating to the liberation of free fatty acids and their conversion to inflammatory mediators.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know the mechanism by which they work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the case of aspirin, it's both indirect and direct actions on at least two different lipase enzymes: phospholipase and the adipose hormone-sensitive lipase that insulin controls. Insulin deficiency liberates more free fatty acids, so both of these act directly on the enzyme which is overactive due to insulin deficiency.

**Andrew Murray:** Most people are frightened of using aspirin because of potential bleeding. I know you recommend using vitamin K with it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Especially if a person has combined antibiotics with aspirin, they might have lost the intestinal bacteria that make vitamin K. Eating lots of cooked greens, such as kale, and liver are the best sources. Some types of cheese are also good sources of vitamin K.

**Andrew Murray:** What would you suggest as a dose for aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your vitamin K is okay, I think it's fine to take 200 or 300 milligrams every day. If it's to correct a problem such as diabetes or some chronic inflammatory problem, then up to... well, I know people who have temporarily taken 6,000 or 7,000 milligrams a day. Like 20 standard aspirin tablets.

## Caller: Liver Enzymes and Greens

**Caller (Kansas City):** I have a couple of questions. One is about a liver enzyme. I have a high ALT. Any suggestions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When any cell is stressed—for example, hypothyroidism lowers the energy production of a cell—it tends to take up water. When it takes up water, it becomes somewhat porous and its natural enzymes leak out into the bloodstream. Just by looking at the type of enzyme, you can't be sure whether it's coming from a leg muscle you strained, a heart muscle, or the liver. The liver is usually the place they look for enzymes like ALT.

**Caller (Kansas City):** The other question is about leafy greens. I cannot digest vegetables, but I do leafy greens broth and raw juicing. How much would you suggest I have per week to meet nutritional needs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you eat cooked greens by the cups and quarts, it's an adequate source of protein. But if you aren't eating it as your main food for protein, then half a cup to a cup a day will provide your vitamin K and a generous amount of magnesium and calcium. Those are the nutrients that quickly cook out into the broth. If you drink only the water that you cooked a cup or so of leaves in, you get a supplement of magnesium and calcium.

**Caller (Kansas City):** What about raw juicing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's pretty irritating to the intestine. Plants put their most intense defensive toxins into their seeds, but their next most intense irritants and toxins are in the leaves because they don't want to be grazed. They put chemicals in that tend to block your digestive enzymes. Cooking destroys or reduces most of those toxins. If you eat them raw, and if you aren't a ruminant that has evolved a stomach to handle raw leaves, you're most likely to have digestive problems.

## Caller: Aspirin, Caffeine, and Cancer

**Caller (David, Missouri):** I've heard you mention that aspirin is helpful in reducing tumor growth. Also, I use an aspirin powder called BC that has caffeine in it. I've been putting baking soda, magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), and sometimes magnesium chloride in a bath with this aspirin/caffeine powder for knee pain. Does the baking soda create a gradient that pulls those things into the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has diuretic effects and some anti-inflammatory effects from the carbon dioxide itself. The caffeine acts on some of the same enzymes that aspirin does with an anti-inflammatory effect. They both increase your cell respiration and suppress nitric oxide, which is one of our central risky pro-inflammatory mediators that poisons mitochondrial respiration. So caffeine and aspirin have multi-levels of defense for the mitochondria.

**Caller (David, Missouri):** Will that be pulled in through the skin effectively?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Caffeine goes in through the skin more easily than aspirin, but yes, some aspirin is absorbed.

**Caller (David, Missouri):** Does that apply to tumor growth as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Inflammation and respiratory defects are the motor for cancer growth. It happens that if you restore energy production in the mitochondria, you're also lowering the inflammatory stimulants that activate cell division and spreading.

## Caller: Mitochondrial Uncoupling

**Caller (Sacramento):** I have questions about substances that induce mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces ATP production and generates body heat instead. Is this reduced ATP production harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When it's a mild degree of uncoupling, it prevents some of the stray free radical products that happen in the more relaxed, lower-intensity mitochondria. They know that you reduce free radical damage a little by increasing uncoupling.

Another substance which uncouples mitochondria, lowers ATP a little bit, and greatly protects the mitochondrion from free radicals is fructose. Fructose absorbs excess phosphate ions. The absorption of phosphate ions by fructose is a direct defensive system. The pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme is suppressed in cancer—that's why dichloroacetate is gaining interest, as it reactivates that enzyme. But simply lowering the free phosphate in the cell tends to reactivate this crucial enzyme at the top of the energy-producing chain.

When you are supplied with aspirin, caffeine, and fructose, you are not calling on free fatty acids. If you load up the cell with excess free fatty acids from stress, they reverse all of those processes. They block pyruvate dehydrogenase by making more phosphate ions available. Where sugars bind them and lower free phosphates, fatty acids increase them and tend to poison the crucial enzyme.

**Caller (Sacramento):** Does this process of producing heat negatively affect the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It increases heat, among other things. Keeping your body temperature up to an efficient high level makes all of your tissues more stable. The thyroid is very compatible with that. Keeping yourself slightly hyperthyroid doesn't stress anything; in fact, it keeps down those stress signals.

## Caller: Niacinamide, SIBO, and Eggnog

**Caller (Mike, New York):** regarding niacinamide, is there a minimal dose and an upper limit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen really great results from something in the range of 150 to 300 milligrams per day, divided into three smaller doses. But I also know people who have taken over 1,000 or 1,500 milligrams for a very long time without problems. Because manufactured supplements have trace allergenic impurities, it's best to find the smallest amount that works for you.

**Caller (Mike, New York):** Does niacinamide need to be balanced with other B vitamins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thiamine (B1) works with the respiratory enzymes, and of course, you need all of them. B12, B1, and biotin are very closely involved with the respiratory apparatus.

**Caller (Mike, New York):** Regarding Vitamin B6, some people use the active form (P5P). Are there indicators that a person needs the active form?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With either form of vitamin B6, it's possible to overdose. People are finding that the active form is easier to overdose with. It used to take several hundred milligrams over several months to produce toxic effects on the nerves, but some people are seeing it with as little as 50 milligrams over a long time with the active form. I think it's good to start with 10 milligrams, which is far beyond the normal daily requirement. 10 to 20 milligrams is almost always all a person needs therapeutically.

**Caller (Mike, New York):** You've discussed using carrot salads to lower intestinal bacteria. If that doesn't work for SIBO, would the drug metronidazole (Flagyl) be safe to try?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens to be a pretty toxic antibiotic. I think it's good to try a lot of other things first. There are some bacterial products that are more actively germicidal in the intestine, and I think there are some intestinal detoxifying antibiotics that are a lot safer than metronidazole.

**Caller (Mike, New York):** You mentioned anecdotally about people with leukemia treating it with raw eggnog. Could you elaborate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were using a whole eggnog. Fresh egg lecithin itself has been shown to have antiviral and antibacterial activities. The white of the egg is peculiar for its ability to bind minerals. The combination of the lecithin and raw egg white probably has some special germicidal effect.

## Water and Yeast

**Engineer:** Two callers asked questions off-air. First: dehydration and water requirements. Second: the difference between nutritional yeast and brewer's yeast.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding yeast, there are many strains and they taste different. Brewer's yeast that actually comes from a brewery generally has hops flavor in it, so it's very bitter. Nutritional yeasts have been grown especially for supplements, and some have added chemical substances like selenium. Basically, yeast chemistry itself is always rich in B vitamins.

Regarding hydration, keeping your cell energy up is the basic thing. You want to keep the cell water under control—neither too hydrated nor too dehydrated. The regulating minerals (sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium) are part of keeping a balance between intracellular and extracellular water.

Drinking extra water when you're not thirsty can disturb your mineral and hormone balance. For example, too much water in relation to minerals tends to increase your prolactin, because prolactin is a water and salt regulating hormone. It's probably more important not to push excess water. Thirst is almost always a good indicator of how much you need. If you're drinking milk and fruit juice, that can provide all the water you need.

## Caller: Age Spots

**Caller (Oklahoma City):** What would you apply on your face to get rid of age spots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on what they're made of. Sometimes high estrogen or high polyunsaturated fats can cause a fairly sudden appearance of age spots at an area that's irritated or sun-exposed. Changing your diet away from polyunsaturated fats and rubbing some vitamin E into those spots can help remove them. There are enzymes that can break down even fairly old, long-standing lipofuscin pigment, and vitamin E is an activator of that.

If it's largely a sun-induced spot, you might try rubbing some niacinamide. Dissolve a high-potency niacinamide tablet in a tiny amount of water and apply that to the spot every day for a week or two. It fades a lot of the pigments.

**Caller (Oklahoma City):** Is soy-derived vitamin E okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a pure, high-potency vitamin E is good. 100 or 200 milligrams orally is probably enough that you can put a little on a spot, and sometimes that helps the enzymes to clear it out.

## Nerve Damage and Glucose

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the topic of tonight. Even in the presence of supplemented insulin, diabetics still get neuropathies—sensation loss, particularly in the feet. How is this process at odds with excess sugar when sugar is a vital energy-producing currency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've gone through many articles recently. I watched a video by Gershom Zajicek, a medical professor in Israel who has a very good understanding of physiology. He explains how increased blood glucose is called for by the brain to make up for its needs. But after explaining the compensatory effect of high glucose for the brain, he uses the term "glycotoxic" for the harmful effects of glucose. He just resorted to a word to explain how glucose affects other organs without really explaining the mechanism.

The changes in the nerves include everything that is failing because of a lack of energy. When cells are living on fatty acids, the fatty acids intrinsically disturb the metabolism of phosphate, turn off glucose energy production, and activate nitric oxide, the respiratory inhibitor.

In the pancreas, glucose stimulates the regeneration of new insulin-producing cells. It's the bad balance—too much free fatty acid and not enough glucose to defend the cells—that causes them to die.

In nerves, one of the effects of failing energy is the inability to make cholesterol and convert cholesterol into neurosteroids. When a nerve or its supporting glial cells are injured by anything—including lack of glucose or oxygen—they stop producing the defensive steroids from cholesterol and begin producing estrogen. The diabetic brain and nerves have more aromatase (the enzyme which converts androgens to estrogens) than a normal person. The estrogen sends out signals to surrounding cells, which normally causes them to produce protective nerve steroids like pregnenolone and progesterone. But if you don't have the energy, you get stuck producing just the estrogen, which keeps things excited and stressed.
