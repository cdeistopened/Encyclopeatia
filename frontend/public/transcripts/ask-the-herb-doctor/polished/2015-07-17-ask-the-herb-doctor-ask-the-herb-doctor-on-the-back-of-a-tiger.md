## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed herbalists who trained in England. We recommend personalized advice in nutrition, supplements, herbs, diet, and lifestyle. Tonight is a little departure from the last few years. We are hosting two filmmakers, Brad Abrahams and Jeremy Stewart, who are producing a documentary film called *On the Back of a Tiger*. They have interviewed eight maverick scientists, including Dr. Ray Peat, weaving an alternate story of life from the molecular level to consciousness and perception. They challenge mainstream medical dogma with scientific research, illuminating radical new ways of understanding disease and its treatment. Welcome, Brad and Jeremy.

**Brad Abrahams:** Thanks for the great intro. It sums it up nicely.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And welcome, Dr. Peat, to the show.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hello.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, we have been fortunate to interview you for a number of years. You frequently mention eminent scientists and groundbreaking alternative researchers whose view of mainstream medicine runs contrary to the dogma perpetuated by Big Pharma. Brad and Jeremy have been traveling Europe to track down these scientists. I want to cover the timeline of these interviews, but first, I’d like to ask Brad and Jeremy to outline their professional and academic backgrounds.

## Filmmaker Backgrounds

**Brad Abrahams:** My background and Jeremy's are quite similar. We both went to film school and soon after graduating entered the advertising and commercial production world. We were trapped there for many years, pining away, trying to figure out a way to work on projects that were more meaningful to us. You can't do that with a full-time job; it takes up so much creative and physical energy. We ended up quitting, still working freelance for funds, but spending more of our time on projects like this. We have focused specifically on this project for the last year.

**Andrew Murray:** Did you have any background reasons for pursuing this health topic?

**Jeremy Stewart:** We are both sort of sensitive people regarding what we eat and the environment. Some people are maybe more hypothyroid than others, as Ray might say. That is how we became friends while working together—reading *World's Healthiest Foods* and realizing we had a lot in common. Seeing health problems in friends and family who couldn't find solutions was always in the background.

**Brad Abrahams:** For myself, it was originally things like really bad digestion, allergies, and fatigue. A lot of it came from overworking and the confines of the modern world. More recently, it has been seeing the deteriorating health of family and friends, particularly my father, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I was already skeptical of the medical establishment, but seeing the bad science and suspect motives with this disease really spurred a sense of urgency.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How did you first find out about Dr. Peat?

**Brad Abrahams:** Originally through Danny Roddy. I had been on the roller coaster of diets and found Danny's site, which mentioned Dr. Peat. I found it fascinating that someone was looking at health and nutrition starting at the molecular level and having such a solid grasp of the biochemistry. The work is dense, so it took a couple of years of reading, listening, and self-experimentation to really grasp the unique view.

## Dr. Peat’s Academic Journey

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, for listeners who haven't heard our show before, what is your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was studying art and literature as an undergraduate and did my master's thesis mostly on William Blake. I was interested in life in general and saw biology as a way to get concrete facts that would confirm alternative views. I saw dogma and political opinions influencing what was teachable in the humanities, and I thought real science might have relevance there.

As soon as I enrolled at the University of Oregon to work on a PhD in biology, I realized that biology was exactly as unscientific as linguistics or philosophy. Ideology was right at the center of nerve biology. I wrote to Gilbert Ling in 1968 and told him what my professors were teaching—things he had shown to be profoundly wrong 20 years previously. He answered and said, "You just don't understand what science is. Science is all about prestige and money."

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What year was that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 1968. After a few more months working with the nerve biology people, I found that the reproductive biologist was actually a scientist. When I observed things contrary to the dogma, he asked, "Is it repeatable? Then go ahead." However, the nerve biologist wouldn't even look at the experiments I was doing. All my experiments showed something contrary to the nerve dogma, and my professor would turn away so he didn't have to see what the instruments were showing.

## The Documentary: *On the Back of a Tiger*

**Andrew Murray:** That is the thrust of tonight's show. Brad and Jeremy have produced a fantastic movie clip showing the different people they've interviewed. These are all PhDs, professors, and research scientists who are directly refuting long-held tenets of science. You can find out more at [PerceiveThinkAct.com](http://www.perceivethinkact.com). Let's go through the different scientists. How did the idea to interview these specific people come about?

**Brad Abrahams:** It was the original phone conversation with Dr. Peat. He asked if we had thought about talking to Harold Hillman or Mae-Wan Ho. We started diving deeper into their work and realized there is a much larger story to tell. Ray has connected the dots and woven together what seem like disparate theories into a cohesive new model for the workings of life.

## Scientist: Harold Hillman

**Andrew Murray:** Let's start with Harold Hillman.

**Brad Abrahams:** We started filming with Harold Hillman around April 15th of last year. The crux of his work is his criticism of traditional microscopy and the use of the electron microscope. He argues that most of the structures we see are artifacts caused by the processing that once-living material must go through. It would make your head spin hearing him list the dehydration, dyeing, and smashing involved. What you are left with bears almost no resemblance to a living cell.

**Jeremy Stewart:** He made a film you can find on YouTube. He shows a side-by-side of a living cell, which looks like a transparent blob, and then the same cell after being washed in alcohol and other compounds, looking about a third of the size, squashed and squiggly.

**Brad Abrahams:** His work was so difficult to criticize that people would just leave the room when he spoke at scientific conferences.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a famous Swedish electron microscopy expert named Fritiof Sjöstrand who did a lot of very clear explanations using different fixatives, showing how profound the artifacts are in standard preparations. He was a mainstream researcher, but the mainstream simply overlooked his work on the artifacts.

## Scientist: Mae-Wan Ho

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move to Dr. Mae-Wan Ho.

**Jeremy Stewart:** She has covered a lot of topics, including controversies on GMOs, but we talked to her about her study of quantum biology and the crystalline structure of organisms. She used a microscope generally used in geology that utilizes polarized light. She found that small organisms had the same sort of crystalline structure as rocks, but in liquid form. This fits in with structured water and thinking about the organism in a way that is counter to the mechanistic views of science. She wrote the book *The Rainbow and the Worm*.

**Brad Abrahams:** Those findings connected with criticisms against Neo-Darwinism. If the organism is not fundamentally mechanistic but much more fluid and subtle, it supports theories more in line with Sidney Fox and others.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That image of the worm is one of the most important things people should start thinking about regarding quantum biology. I think Albert Szent-Györgyi was the one who motivated people to start going in the direction of electronic biology and a coherent view of the cell. Mae-Wan Ho is, to a great degree, an extension of some of Szent-Györgyi's ideas.

## Scientist: Gerald Pollack

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to Dr. Gerald Pollack, often called the "Water Wizard."

**Jeremy Stewart:** He is known for his TED Talk and his focus on structured water. He is unpopular in his department because he studies something that seems like it should have already been figured out. He shows that there are unusual, electrically based forms of water called EZ water—the Exclusion Zone. Water builds up on a surface and purifies itself, excluding everything else. This seems to be how water is structured inside cells.

**Brad Abrahams:** He found that one of the substances that creates EZ water with the most affinity is aspirin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything he has been doing in recent years is extremely interesting. He has developed theories on how light energy, specifically infrared, is used in building structure in water. There is a young German named Andrei Sommer who is working with red light structuring water—a very concrete demonstration of what Gerald is working on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that why red light is so anti-inflammatory? Because of its effects on the water of the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that's part of it.

## Scientist: Gilbert Ling

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about Dr. Gilbert Ling.

**Brad Abrahams:** Gilbert is 96. When we saw him, he was in shockingly good health, though recently he had a complication. He is most known for disproving the sodium pump hypothesis, which is at the root of all taught physiology regarding the role of the cell membrane. His hypothesis, the Association Induction Hypothesis, details a totally different model of the cell based only on physics and chemistry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cell membrane theory relates to Neo-Darwinism and the idea that life is like a machine which has to run to keep itself in a given state. Gilbert Ling showed that even if you turn off the energy supply, a cell is stable for many hours. The sodium keeps going in and out, but the cell retains the lifelike imbalance between sodium and potassium.

In an electron microscope course I took, I tried different fixatives based on Sjöstrand's publications. Simply by using a different fixative, my cells were nothing but membranes all the way through. I looked at the origin of the membrane concept and found that 19th-century doctors treated ulcers and burns with osmic acid (osmium tetroxide) to create what they called a "false membrane." The first preparations for electron microscopy showed no membranes, but scientists believed there *had* to be membranes. Someone recalled that old medical concept, applied osmic acid to living cells, and created a membrane.

**Jeremy Stewart:** Anytime there is a new thing that goes in and out of the cell, they have to create a new pump to explain it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you wash all the ions out of hair and dip the hair in serum, it picks up the proper ions and excludes sodium. So apparently, dead hair has all the necessary working pumps.

## Scientist: Michael Persinger

**Andrew Murray:** Who is Dr. Michael Persinger?

**Jeremy Stewart:** He studies parapsychology and has done a huge amount of work on the effects of fields on life and consciousness. He is known for the "God Helmet" experiment, showing that electromagnetic stimulation of the right hemisphere induced a "sensed presence" in people. He has done decades of work showing how sensitive life is to electromagnetic fields.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what is your take on Dr. Persinger?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My interest in fields goes way back. My brother was a radio ham, so I had access to electronic equipment from age nine. In 1968, I went to Russia to talk to a man working in magneto-biology. One of my first experiments at the university was looking at the effect of a strong magnet on a crab nerve. I could see that the presence of a magnetic field affected the structure of the water and the delay between stimulation and reaction. Very subtle fields have very big effects on organisms.

## Scientist: Fred Kummerow

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss Dr. Fred Kummerow, who is 100 years old.

**Brad Abrahams:** He looks even better than you’d imagine—no age spots, full head of hair. He is known for his 60-year crusade against trans fats. What is not reported is that he says very similar things about polyunsaturated fats. When we told him fish oil is sold as supplements, he physically recoiled. He is horrified that a billion-dollar industry is harming people's health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Trans fats normally occur in butter as an intermediate stage. The next step is Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). The beneficial effects of CLA block some of the toxic effects of normal linoleic acid. So, even though butter contains some trans fats, it also contains the beneficial form.

**Brad Abrahams:** Dr. Kummerow's criticism is about the artificially created trans fats, not the natural ones in dairy. He likes butter.

## The "Health Seeker": Danny Roddy

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to Danny Roddy.

**Jeremy Stewart:** There are two sides to the film: the scientists and the "health seekers." Danny is a health blogger focused on hair loss. He has no formal academic background but has learned an incredible amount on his own.

**Brad Abrahams:** He has been on the roller coaster many of us relate to. He has the gift of taking complex scientific theories and translating them so anyone can understand them.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** You also interviewed Dr. Peat. It seems he unifies the theories of all these different scientists.

**Jeremy Stewart:** Working scientists usually focus on a tiny area and aren't fully aware of the larger context. Ray’s work puts all these people into a paradigm that makes sense together in a holistic view.

**Brad Abrahams:** What is the worth of scientific inquiry if you can't apply it practically to people's health? That is where Dr. Peat's work resonates with us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat helps people take their health into their own hands. He encourages them to look at how they feel after they eat certain foods.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, can you comment on the film?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The bits I have seen are very much fun to watch. It is good to see the newer stuff about Gilbert Ling and the others.
