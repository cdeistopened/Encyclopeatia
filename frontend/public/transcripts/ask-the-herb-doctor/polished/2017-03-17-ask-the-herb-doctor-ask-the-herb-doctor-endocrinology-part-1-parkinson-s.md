# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Endocrinology and Parkinson’s Disease

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** From the Middle East to Ireland, it's this evening's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We have been very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us for a long time now with various topics. This month is no exception. I wanted to provide an outline or a basis for the listeners. I know people listening to these podcasts from all over the world have found them interesting and informative. It has led them to read research from people Dr. Peat has mentioned, or they’ve had conditions and recovered listening to Dr. Peat's advice. I am very much aware that this is a real resource.

We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us. I wanted to start an outline this month with endocrinology as the subject, specifically the nervous system as a whole. We are going to get into Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism as an introduction to the endocrine system. Later, perhaps next month, we will get into the pituitary, thymus, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries, and testes—how they affect health and how everything we do can consciously interact for good or bad with our health. We're not at the mercy of anything in particular; we make choices. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. I wanted to explore the endocrine system. It is a large topic, but one I feel will be a useful exercise in understanding physiology from your perspective. You make regular mention of pioneering scientists whose works give a better appreciation of the physiological processes occurring in the body. These often provide a new direction away from the hijacked modern scientific theories we're cultured to accept—a lot of which are a Pandora's box of ever-increasing drug dependencies.

Communication systems and appropriate responses are key to good health and functioning. This is the role of the endocrine system. I found records of the Chinese isolating sex and pituitary hormones from human urine in 200 BC. Then obviously the ancient Greeks and Romans—Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen—until the emergence of the germ theory in the 19th century. I think that is where it veered off the rails of normality and common sense. Dr. Peat, would you mind giving an overview of the understanding of disease past to present, and how your rationale differs?

## The History of Disease Concepts: Organicism vs. Mechanism

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see it as a deviation from the Chinese and the Greeks, who had a pretty unified picture of what an organism is. Aristotle was pretty much an organicist in his understanding of the organism. It was really around the time of Descartes, in the early part of the 17th century, when things got formalized on the wrong track.

Descartes described the organism as a machine completely separate from consciousness. Consciousness was guiding the machine, possibly from some contact point in the brain, but mostly people who were persecuted by the monarchies continued to think along the organic, unified understanding of what an animal or a person is. Following Descartes, the organism was seen as made up of parts, just like a steam engine or a clock. Each part could be defined, understood, and mechanically interlocked with the other parts. The consciousness or the soul was seen as something completely separate from this machine.

When the idea of infection—something from the environment causing a disease—came in, it happened that the use of the microscope had developed to the point that people had seen the compartments in plants. They called the compartments "cells." When the plant dried up, it left the cellulose framework—empty little chambers. A more underground approach looked at particles like red blood cells and called the units "corpuscles," or little bodies, rather than empty compartments. This idea of breaking the organism down into cells and seeing those as parts of a machine made up of material, without consciousness or spirit, became the background for seeing a disease as a particular mechanical interference with the operation of the machine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And this is where the term reductionism came from, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. One line of thinking was that it was a particular little particle of evil material—a germ cell analogous to the cells that make up the machine—interfering with our material particles. That became identified as a disease. It was a very concrete, specific interference with the machine.

As people looked more closely at tumors, they saw it was really a matter of organization rather than some particular concrete change or substance. But this idea of organization took about 150 years to finally catch on. Right up until the beginning of this century, people were still stuck on Descartes' picture of a mechanical organism being interrupted by something right down on the cellular or molecular level. Cancer was defined as an evil cell, a mutant cell containing bad genetic material or defective DNA. So, in the case of a germ-caused disease, all you had to do was kill the germ. In the case of cancer interpreted as a mutant cell, all you had to do was eliminate every single individual mutant cell and the disease would be cured.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's still how they treat cancer now, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To some degree. Almost everyone is still stuck in this 17th-century idea of what an organism is and what a disease is.

## Parkinson's and Environmental Enrichment

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even regarding Parkinson's disease... in the 19th century, people recognized that all the symptoms of the disease—stiffness, wobbly tremor, and slowness of movement—are simply extreme old age symptoms coming on stronger and earlier. By the latter part of the 19th century, people had noticed that if sufferers took a long train ride to get to the doctor, their symptoms might disappear. Or if they rode in a carriage or on a horse, their symptoms were greatly alleviated by just moving around through space. Some people proposed a vibration therapy. About 40 years ago, someone noticed that swimming alleviated the symptoms. Simply a different kind of stimulation could reverse the symptoms.

It turns out that in animals, you can create the disease by poisoning them. But by giving them an enriched environment, you can reverse the actual anatomical and chemical changes of their nervous system.

**Andrew Murray:** So in the poisoned animals, if you place them in an enriched environment, they no longer display the symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, similar to what they noticed in people who took a long train ride.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to explore Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism, as there are several similar situations. The terms describe a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system affecting mainly the motor system, but also the sensory system, with cognitive, sleep, and mood disturbances.

There is a compound called alpha-synuclein present in Lewy bodies found within the substantia nigra in the brain, which are diagnostic for Parkinson's. There is also a protein called Dardarin. The primary symptoms result from the loss of dopamine-secreting cells within the substantia nigra. There are five major pathways in the brain connecting other areas with the basal ganglia: the motor, ocular-motor, associative, limbic, and orbitofrontal circuits. All of them are disrupted, which explains the varied presentations of the disease.

How do you see this motor circuit working in the body? How would you rationalize an alternative approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My orientation is very similar to Pavlov's, who saw the motor system as subordinate to the sensory system. He saw the cortex of the brain as primarily an extension of the sense organs, and that this formed the environment for the motor reflexes.

The idea of a "reflex" is another thing that originated with Descartes and is simply wrong. The cells aren't mechanically connected in reflex patterns. One of the first people in the West to analyze this carefully was the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He analyzed the meaning of reflexes and clearly showed that there are no reflexes in the Cartesian sense. If you attend a neurology course, you will probably find people still arguing that there are simple, innate mechanical reflexes. For example, the linguistics system of Noam Chomsky is based entirely on this primitive, false idea of brain function based on mechanical reflexes. It simply doesn't work.

In the Pavlovian picture, especially as developed by his student P.K. Anokhin, the sensory system is fluid and continuously being revised as the organism explores its environment. The sense of exploring and being stimulated by newness—traveling through time and space—is in charge, overriding defects in the motor system.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is a relevant picture for seeing disease, especially Parkinson's, in a non-mechanical way. You mentioned the protein Dardarin; the interesting thing about it is that it shows up as a defect in Crohn's disease in the intestine as well as in Parkinson's. Parkinson's typically starts with constipation. In 19th-century medicine, people remembered the intestine as well as the brain in treating disease. It was very common to diagnose death as a result of inflammation of the bowel, which pathologists typically overlook as a side issue. But the intestine was recognized as very important, and the brain as the other end of the organism.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And now doctors are taught that if you have a bowel movement once every three days, it's all normal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you trace out the chemical links between what's going wrong in the intestine and in the rest of the motor system, you can see links, but they're always contextually working. There is no simple pathogenic chemical in the intestine, but the bacteria living there, the food you eat, and the way your intestine responds to it all matter.

**Andrew Murray:** And the stress you're exposed to.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. These act in the activating part of the brain. Around 1950, the reticular activating system was identified. This includes the region where the substantia nigra and the basal ganglia are. This is where sensory input is dished out to activate the upper parts of the brain. When that is happening, it tends to go with an inhibitory effect on the body. So, the stronger your mentality is dreaming, for example, the more relaxed your body tends to be. In Parkinson's, the system tends to be over-activated, unable to relax properly. A characteristic thing is that during sleep and dreams, the person developing Parkinson's doesn't relax properly. If they have a dream, they might scream, thrash around, and hit people. There is a failure of consciousness to override and relax the body.

## Learned Helplessness and Sensory Input

**Andrew Murray:** This reminds me of inescapable stress and the rat experiments, countered by the environmental enrichment you said could restore a Parkinson's-induced effect. We're saying there's a link between environmental enrichment and the progressive replacement of something good that offsets the negative effects of inflammation, bowel degradation, and endotoxin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** P.K. Anokhin and those in the Pavlovian tradition see a global event or process in the brain that they called the "acceptor of action." It's our intention and expectation in the world. This integrates the motor system and dominates the so-called reflexes. This process—which is like a model of everything we know and intend to do—is supported in the organism not just in the brain, but by sensory nerves from the whole body.

This process of being conscious is involved in the activation of the endocrine glands and the nerves themselves. As they metabolize to be conscious, they make changes internally. For example, they turn energy substances like sugar into cholesterol, and cholesterol into pregnenolone. Right in the nerves of the substantia nigra, this process is going on: energy, sugar, cholesterol, pregnenolone, progesterone. The endocrine process stabilizes the structure and the consciousness. The "flavor" of your consciousness, when successful, is modified by the balance between your progesterone, DHEA, other steroids, and the energy processes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you explain the personality of people that develop Parkinson's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are experiencing learned helplessness. The way they live, they have incorporated duties and obligations that they can manage very well, but they aren't overcoming the stress adequately.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because they're not exploring new things or they don't have new input to their brain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're stuck in a way so that they aren't getting enough sensory input or stimulation.

**Andrew Murray:** That's interesting because medical texts describe Parkinson's patients as having emotionless expressions, being difficult to engage, and lacking *joie de vivre*. That's very much part of a learned helplessness construct. Stimulation, you're saying, is part of switching on a holistic approach to Parkinson's, outside of the mechanistic view.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, are you saying new sensory input will increase the dopamine output from the substantia nigra?

**Andrew Murray:** Or the protective progesterone and pregnenolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The dopamine theory is part of the mechanistic view. At the beginning of the 20th century, they saw the brain as a mechanical thing having defects causing the tremor. They actually started cutting out parts of the brain to remove the tremor.

**Andrew Murray:** Sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Norbert Wiener, who invented the word "cybernetics," proposed the best surgery up to that time. He designed radar-searching self-control systems to aim guns. He saw the tremor as a feedback searching process. If his radar gun aiming system was poorly aligned, it would have a tremor—a searching movement back and forth. So he suggested surgery to cut out part of the searching feedback apparatus. It actually worked better than the grosser surgeries. But sometimes it didn't work. Michael J. Fox said he wasn't going to have any more surgical treatments because instead of stopping the tremor on his left side, it started to tremor on the right side.

## The Dopamine Theory and Drug Treatments

**Andrew Murray:** Let's get into the medications. The substantia nigra is the site of dopamine production. I think the nervous system wants to fire fairly constantly, and dopamine controls that from happening ad hoc, allowing ordered movement through inhibition.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's integrated with the inhibiting systems. In itself, it is an activator, but it runs into nerves that feedback with an inhibition.

**Andrew Murray:** L-DOPA is considered the gold standard of treatment. Dopamine doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, but L-DOPA does, and it is converted into dopamine. However, within five years, most patients using L-DOPA have a condition called dyskinesia or bradykinesia, where there are involuntary movements. Most patients using L-DOPA are in worse shape five years down the road than if they weren't treated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the problem is that the whole theory of what L-DOPA and dopamine are doing is mechanistic and mistaken.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they're just putting a Band-Aid on it? They're not treating the sensory input deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another drug approved for Parkinson's is amantadine, or memantine more recently. In the 19th century, they were already using belladonna and hyoscyamine—anticholinergics—to treat the tremors. They were pretty effective and didn't have the bad side effects of increasing rigidity that L-DOPA does.

It turns out that amantadine and memantine have anticholinergic, anti-excitatory effects, but they are also anti-excitatory in the glutamatergic system. The glutamate and cholinergic systems are both very powerful and excitatory. The glutamate system ends up producing nitric oxide. Amantadine and anticholinergics are not only stopping the excitation that is part of the tremor, but they end up lowering the exposure to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a chronic stress-induced factor in suppressing mitochondrial respiration and energy production, accelerating aging of the brain.

Using these drugs actually gives insight into a much more global, organismic process. Rather than just restoring the lost "dopamine regulatory system," it's restoring energy processes and reducing the effects of stress in a systematic way.

## Caller: Overcoming Learned Helplessness

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our first caller.

**Caller:** Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area. Are there simple stepping stones to get out of learned helplessness? For people overcoming hypothyroidism who still find it overwhelming to do big tasks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Painting. Behavioral things like going to new places, meeting new people, doing very different things that you've never done before but thought you might enjoy. Do this at the same time as you try to correct your energy processes that are suppressed—having more enjoyable, varied meals, for example, and making sure your thyroid function is good.

**Caller:** I remember when I asked you what was a good education for our daughter, you said "introduce her to new people." She loves to meet new people and gets so fired up.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding creative outlets like painting or poetry—do you see those as easier constructs to attain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doing something unexpected, out of the routine. Some people actually quit their job and learn a new profession or trade.

## Protective Substances: Caffeine, Nicotine, and Aspirin

**Andrew Murray:** I'm interested in the approach to supporting mitochondria, whether it's Coenzyme Q10 or nootropics. How do you feel about mitochondrial support in the approach to a Parkinson's patient?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Getting good rest is part of the support. Stopping unnecessary excitatory stimulation. Good stimulation should be fun rather than stressful. Everything that is anti-inflammatory can be relaxing as well as stimulating.

Caffeine is extremely protective against all of the defects in Parkinson's disease. It activates while protecting the mitochondria. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which is in some plants like the passion flower, helps eliminate stressful over-excitation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You mean the passion fruit, or lilikoi?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, passion fruit. It’s something we make along with GABA which helps to eliminate stressful over-excitation. Synuclein, which is damaged in Parkinson's, happens to have the same effect as rotenone—a toxic thing seen to cause Parkinson's by blocking Complex I of the mitochondrion.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So all the herbs that act on GABA would be useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and even cannabis, because of its sedative effects, can be protective against toxic types of over-stimulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And what about alcohol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is an antioxidant and can be anti-inflammatory. In the right circumstance, it can be anti-Parkinson's.

**Andrew Murray:** How about nicotine? I've seen research showing nicotine is significantly protective against Parkinson's.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the population effect, where they see smokers have some protection, is partly because it relieves constipation. It activates the intestine, and that in itself has an anti-inflammatory, anti-toxic effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What is the best method for delivery of nicotine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Absorbing it through the skin in the form of an ointment, or ingesting very small amounts of the tobacco leaf very quickly.

**Andrew Murray:** Nicotine is a neurotoxin, but it's not the poisonous component in tobacco smoke—that's mainly the carcinogens and tar. But nicotine can have therapeutic effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And keeping the intestine healthy is crucial because when endotoxin reaches the nervous system, it activates processes that lead to the same blockage of mitochondrial respiration that rotenone or ionizing radiation does. Having CAT scans of the head is probably part of the reason Parkinson's prevalence has increased so greatly over the last 20 or 30 years.

**Andrew Murray:** They are pretty keen to give you CAT scans for anything.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin is another thing. One of the prostaglandins produced in the substantia nigra is very toxic to the brain. Simply having a regular use of aspirin will protect against that prostaglandin made from polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). The breakdown of polyunsaturated fats produces acrolein, a very toxic material. That is one of the things that turns synuclein into a toxic fibrous material, sort of like the prions in mad cow disease.

**Andrew Murray:** I read that they haven't proved beyond a doubt that these Lewy bodies are pathogenic; they might have a protective role.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the body might be "parking" these synuclein fibrils to get them out of the way, packing them up in little compartments that are relatively safe. But some of the toxic fibrils of synuclein are known to be passed from one cell to another, causing damage to the cell that receives it.

## The Thyroid and Sleep Connection

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you were talking about rapid movement and the dream state in people developing Parkinson's—is that not also a symptom of low thyroid because their muscles just can't relax?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same thing. Nothing in the body can relax fully when your thyroid function is low. That's one of the funny things that came out of the idea of the cell as a compartment. If you think of it as a corpuscle that has to be in a state ready to work, the "rested" state is actually a high-energy state. It is full of energy, ready to go.

If you don't have enough thyroid, glucose, and oxygen to produce the energy, you stay in a semi-contracted, excited state. In Parkinson's, this reaches a chronically deadly, cell-killing condition. In chronic hypothyroidism, it's simply a nuisance that your sleep isn't as restful as it should be. You can't get into the deep, relaxing, restorative sleep because you don't have enough energy. The cells keep churning through the energy-producing process without relaxing and storing up the energy as glycogen, ATP, and creatine phosphate.
