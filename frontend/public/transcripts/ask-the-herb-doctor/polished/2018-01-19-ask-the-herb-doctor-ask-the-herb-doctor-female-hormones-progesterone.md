## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, we run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM. We invite callers to call in with questions related to the month's subject. The toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723.

It is January 2018. Happy New Year. This month's subject is going to be related to female hormones, specifically progesterone. While progesterone is typically viewed as female, it is also produced by males. We will run through many disorders, but I wanted to highlight the difficulty of looking online for information. The internet is an excellent source, but it is also a source of disinformation. You have to be really careful where you pick your narrative.

We are going to look at a couple of instances where very prominent peer-reviewed trials with huge cohorts of people—thousands of people involved to try and demonstrate an effect—failed to show results. Particularly regarding the effects of progesterone on traumatic brain injury (TBI). We will also look at the effects on cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, postpartum depression, catamenial epilepsy (menstrual-related epilepsy), and sleep apnea.

I have worked with Dr. Peat for the last nine or ten years, and a lot of what we found out from him has been revelational. When I was studying herbal medicine in England, we were trained by doctors, endocrinologists, and pathologists. A lot of things we learned, I later found out from Dr. Peat and further research, contained quite a lot of untruths.

Dr. Peat’s website, raypeat.com, is fully referenced with articles. I will introduce him now. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us again. Please give us your academic background and your research history.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My PhD study was at the University of Oregon, 1968 to 1972. My dissertation was on reproductive aging. My intention when I went back to graduate school in biology was to study the brain, but I found that brain research was the most doctrinaire, next to genetics. I looked around and found that reproductive physiology was actually oriented towards science.

My background before that had been studying literature, linguistics, and painting. It is probably the background in literature that made me think in an adversarial manner in evaluating science, rather than an authoritarian one—accepting things just because the professor said it's true. I think the legal attitude of looking for truth by an adversarial approach should apply to medicine and science in general.

## Progesterone and Traumatic Brain Injury Studies

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to start by looking at the evidence regarding traumatic brain injury. The numbers are staggering—whether it's professional sports, auto wrecks, or falls. It has been one of the most difficult conditions to treat.

There were some very good Phase 1 and 2 trials using progesterone that were very promising. These spurred the Phase 3 trials, which had huge numbers—10,000 in one and 1,500 in the other. Both of these studies—the PROTECT III and the SYNAPSE trial—seemingly found no beneficial effect. This contradicts your description of the anti-inflammatory and anti-edema effects of progesterone. Given that the earlier trials were so promising, how do you interpret this negative effect shown in the Phase 3 trials?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been about 15 big studies on brain injury. Interestingly, after overwhelmingly promising results from using intravenous magnesium to reduce swelling and restore metabolism, all of these, by the time they reached the Phase 3 level, suddenly showed the opposite results. Nothing turned out to be beneficial for treating human brain trauma in these big studies, even though previous smaller studies and animal studies were showing increased survival and full recovery.

The fact that something happens at the Phase 3 level is very suspicious. When the government and big corporations get involved, I suspect they are protecting drugs that are not generic the way progesterone is.

For example, urea. I don't think there has ever been a major study of treating brain trauma with simply intravenous urea, but it has had amazingly good results. I think a serious study could be done using all the known beneficial things: urea, magnesium, progesterone, hypertonic saline solution, and so on. If you do everything known to be beneficial to the brain, you'd get even better results than with a single drug-like treatment.

The worst thing about this big PROTECT study was that they not only didn't give a big enough dose, but they gave it emulsified with Intralipid, a soybean oil. The amount of soybean emulsion they were giving intravenously is, in itself, harmful.

**Andrew Murray:** That was a 6% solution.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around 1970, someone injected an emulsified soy oil into rats and showed that on the first pass through the brain, 17% of the oil was taken up into the brain. There is no blood-brain barrier that functions against oil. They dissected the brain and showed that one dose of oil was enough to alter the morphology of brain cells. So, intravenous treatment with something supposedly beneficial, mixed with a known toxin to the brain, is hard to imagine—unless corporate and government interests were involved.

**Andrew Murray:** I noticed from that trial they were only using 2 milligrams of progesterone per milliliter. The drug infusion started with a loading dose of 0.71 mg/kg for one hour, followed by 0.5 mg/kg for the rest of the 119 hours. Can you put 2 milligrams or half a milligram per kilo in perspective regarding the progesterone exposure most females enjoy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people have reported that in the last week or two of a healthy pregnancy, a woman's placenta is producing 800 or 900 milligrams of progesterone per day. That doesn't do anything harmful; it is very protective. Women generally feel great when their progesterone is at a maximum. So, they could easily have given 2,000 milligrams of progesterone per day instead of a few hundred.

**Andrew Murray:** A doctor named Donald Stein, who has been studying brain trauma for 30 years at Emory University, published a paper in the *Journal of Neurotrauma* in 2017 titled "Suboptimal Dosing Parameters as Possible Factors in Negative Phase 3 Clinical Trials." He refuted the dose given and the use of the emulsifying agent—the polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) soybean oil.

You have always talked about PUFAs being pro-estrogenic, and estrogen is a known water-logger of neurons. This works against any tiny dose of progesterone in the trial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You mentioned the estrogenic effect of the polyunsaturated fats. When there is a trauma, the toxicity of the PUFAs is tremendously amplified by their conversion to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. In any trauma—sunburn, parasites, broken bones, X-rays—estrogen is produced in the injured tissue and the whole organism. Any harm to the organism increases estrogen production and the conversion of PUFAs to pro-inflammatory mediators.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this what the literature terms the excitotoxic situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is a specific part that happens under the influence of estrogen and PUFAs. They activate the glutamatergic transmitters in the brain—these excitatory signals—to the point that they become toxic. Progesterone opposes all of these. It blocks the formation of prostaglandins, blocks the release of stored PUFAs, blocks the formation of inflammatory mediators, and antagonizes the glutamatergic excitotoxins. Every function of the organism harmed by trauma is intensified by estrogen and PUFAs, and those are blocked by progesterone.

## Caller: Progesterone for Men & Salt Intake

**Caller (Jeff from NY):** I was listening to the comment about progesterone being a miracle product. Does it only apply to women? I think you've mentioned that pregnenolone is universal, but men have to be careful with progesterone—specifically a 55 to 70-year-old where the risk of endotoxins is increasing.

My second question is about salt and insomnia. I switched from sea salt to canning salt (kosher salt), which is pure salt without other minerals. I think it really helped; I don't wake up at 3:00 AM anymore. Do you agree with that?

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding salt, the Himalayan salts and deep earth crystal salts do contain other trace elements and potentially negative materials like heavy metals. I think a straightforward white sea salt or canning salt is preferable. Dr. Peat, what do you think about progesterone in men?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, on the salt: my interest in salt supplementation was related to the estrogen issue. I saw premenstrual women restricting their salt and making their symptoms worse. I suggested to a friend that she salt her food to taste, and suddenly she didn't retain water; salt was acting as a diuretic.

Years later, I knew old people who were restricting salt and developing serious insomnia. I suggested the same thing, and they got good sleep, and their blood pressure actually came down. Tom Brewer, with his diet for pregnant women in the 1950s and 60s, saw that supplementing pregnant women who had toxemia symptoms with huge amounts of salt essentially cured the toxemia.

Regarding progesterone: I used it myself. After working with aging animals, I tried it on my own migraines. Twice, during an intense migraine, I had a complete reversal of symptoms in one to two minutes after ingesting about 100 milligrams. When I took too much for too long, I noticed it had the effect of a "cold shower" for a day or two—an anti-testosterone effect. But that passes quickly when you stop taking it.

I found as I got older that I could tolerate 5mg or 10mg a day without that anti-testosterone effect. Several people have told me it actually seems to reinforce their testosterone. I think that works because testosterone is converted to estrogen under stress. If you stop that conversion with progesterone—which, like aspirin, inhibits the conversion of testosterone to estrogen—you can actually raise your testosterone.

## Caller: Iodine, Amino Acids, and Breath Holding

**Caller (Jeff from NY):** On iodine, I know you've mentioned that even small amounts can be toxic. But outside the laboratory, does more iodine make sense in an environment where we are exposed to fluoridated water? Does it counteract the fluoride?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never seen a test of that idea. When I spent time in San Francisco, I was using a daily supplement of T3 (Cytomel). Within a few days of drinking the fluoridated water, I developed a migraine, which made me assume it was a sudden crash of my thyroid function. If you take T3 with fluoridated water, the fluoride in the stomach will totally knock out the dose. As long as it is circulating as ionic fluoride, I think it will knock out any T3 it runs into.

**Caller (Jeff from NY):** Regarding amino acids, you recommend gelatin for proline and glycine. But are isolated amino acids like taurine or carnosine beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't discourage people from taking those if they want to try them, but I don't use them myself.

**Caller (Jeff from NY):** Lastly, I am holding my breath to increase CO2. Is there a good target time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Holding your breath has value, but the time depends on your metabolic rate. If you have a high thyroid function, you might be unconscious after a minute because you are consuming oxygen very fast. A hypothyroid person consumes oxygen much slower. A very high proportion of the population is hyperventilating, so breathing slower is beneficial, but you can't set a specific time without an oxygen consumption test.

## Caller: White Fat vs. Brown Fat

**Caller (Finland):** I read a recent book by a doctor claiming it is almost impossible to get rid of white fat, and that you just accumulate it. He suggests using cold, but I know you've said the stress of cold makes it worse. Also, does fasting turn good brown fat into bad white fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a lot of interesting research on that. My orientation is that the activation of T3, the active thyroid hormone, is the crucial thing. Prolonged fasting has harmful effects, one of which is knocking out T3 in the tissues.

Even though T3 circulates in the bloodstream, various tissues (muscles, skin, brain) can produce T3 from T4 locally. The crucial factor for producing it locally is partly glucose, but fructose seems to have a special ability to activate that local production of T3. I would say eating enough sugar—having orange juice and fruit regularly—is much better than either chilling yourself or starving yourself.

**Caller (Finland):** If you were to choose a place to live to keep metabolism high, would you choose a high altitude, warm place?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, somewhere like Peru at 12,000 to 14,000 feet near the equator. Or Toluca, Mexico. I feel exhilarated at that altitude.

## Progesterone and GABA Receptors

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to talk about the GABA-A receptor. Progesterone and its metabolite, allopregnanolone, bind to this receptor, producing an anxiolytic, calm response. Do you think the metabolite is more active than progesterone per se?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since pregnenolone, the precursor, is pro-GABA, I suspect progesterone itself is too. It is converted to allopregnanolone, which seems to be the most powerful activator of the GABA system. But I think all of them act in the same direction. Besides activating GABA to reduce stress, progesterone also inhibits excitatory processes, including the glutamatergic and NMDA receptor systems.

## Caller: Disc Herniation and Regeneration

**Caller (Buffalo John):** If someone has a disc herniation, is it possible to regenerate that gel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know people get well from it, though I've never seen X-ray evidence of the spacing increasing. I think it is possible for the disc to rebuild itself and for the bones to conform to the regenerating cartilage.

**Caller (Buffalo John):** I've had six knee operations and three herniated discs. Being on your diet and mitigating PUFA has almost eliminated my pain. I also use red light. You mentioned putting progesterone on a mole and it moving?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, pigment cells are extremely mobile. If you apply progesterone or DHEA near a mole, the cells may migrate to satisfy their need for the substance. I applied it to a mole on my temple. The pigment cells formed rings behind the mole, and the mole itself constricted and eventually fell off without leaving a scar.

**Caller (Buffalo John):** Can you take GABA as a supplement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In animal studies, when given to a healthy animal, none of it seemed to get into the brain. But if the animal was sleep-deprived and the brain really needed GABA, then it was able to get in and relax it.

## Caller: Monk Fruit Sweetener

**Caller (Chris from Garberville):** I've been using Monk fruit sugar. It's a melon from southern China. I stopped eating table sugar and switched to this, and my inflammation disappeared. It is zero glycemic. Have you heard of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't heard of it.

**Andrew Murray:** I suspect it might be mixed with erythritol or stevia. I think those sugar substitutes have more negative effects than positive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The effect I described of ordinary sucrose, for example in orange juice, is able to stimulate weight loss by activating the T3 in your fat cells. Fructose is available in pure form and doesn't increase blood glucose the way starch does.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. We are out of time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, very good.

**Andrew Murray:** For those listening, check out the SYNAPSE and PROTECT III studies on progesterone and TBI, and then read Dr. Donald Stein's 2017 paper in the *Journal of Neurotrauma* which refutes them. Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com. We will see you next month.
