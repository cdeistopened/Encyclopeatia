# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Skin Cancer, Candida, and Metabolism

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. It is the winter solstice, December 21, 2018. For the last 14 or 15 years, we have done this monthly show broadcast from the KMUD studio in Redway, California. Every third Friday of the month, we decide on a topic based on herbal medicine, alternative medicine, nutrition, and dietary advice, which we believe is a good alternative to standard medical practice—though we recognize medical practice certainly has benefits.

We have been joined for the last 10 years by Dr. Raymond Peat, a research endocrinologist and a scientist in the true sense of the word. I think in the empirical sense, research really involves digging into a lot of literature and documents and scientifically analyzing the data for congruence or obvious mistakes. Dr. Peat has spent the last 45 years or more after his PhD doing continued research in nutrition, health, and how to help yourself using simple methods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for joining us. For the benefit of those who have never heard you before, would you outline your academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and early 1960s, I was studying literature and painting mostly. Then, from 1968 to 1972, I did a graduate program for a PhD in biology. My approach to research is probably influenced by my literature background—thinking of propaganda analysis and sensitivity to how people use language to manipulate preconceptions. I think everyone looking at the internet has to spend more time thinking about propaganda analysis and how advertising has invaded and practically taken over many of the medical journals.

**Andrew Murray:** Just very quickly, tell people what your specialty was when you graduated and what you looked at in your research.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My dissertation was on the biochemical changes involved in reproductive aging, working on the hamster uterus mostly. I saw how many factors parallel aging in the biochemical pattern that they create. Estrogen excess, progesterone deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, and exposure to radiation all create the same typical age pattern of metabolism. It is at its most extreme in cancer metabolism.

That was why I was so interested in Otto Warburg's work at the time I was starting graduate school. American biochemists were turning against Otto Warburg, despite his Nobel Prize, because he was saying that cancer is a metabolic condition, not a gene mutation. Now, 50 years later, the US and European cultures are finally coming around to looking at what Warburg did almost 100 years ago.

## Tullio Simoncini, Iodine, and Candida

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to continue last month's subject of skin cancer. I want to talk about an Italian MD named Tullio Simoncini. He has been controversial and was eventually struck off the medical register, but he was getting successful results treating people with topical cancers—basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas—using a 7% iodine solution. He also treats internal cancers with a different protocol.

Simoncini stated categorically that cancer is based on a yeast, and *Candida albicans* is essentially the organism responsible for it. Dr. Peat, what do you think about Tullio Simoncini's approach and his rationale?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40 years ago, there was a big mania in the US blaming everything on Candida. That led me to study how it actually interacts. If you are under stress, hypothyroid, inclined towards diabetes (not being able to oxidize glucose thoroughly), and tending to have high estrogen, it happens that all of those favor and attract Candida growth. The presence of Candida coincides with hypothyroidism, estrogen excess, and poor ability to oxidize glucose.

Inflammation and improper oxidation of glucose are typical of cancer metabolism more intensely than of simple stress metabolism. So, Simoncini is seeing something very central to the metabolism of cancer, which is intensified by the inflammation-promoting effects of the Candida.

Candida itself is attracted to estrogen; estrogen is a sex hormone for the Candida fungus. It contains an enzyme which can aromatize male steroid hormones, so it can become an amplifier of estrogen. Once it gets in a tissue and the immune system is failing, the fungus can convert from a yeast form to a filament form and invade the tissues looking for sugar and estrogen. It is very commonly associated with cancers. The sicker a person is, the weaker their immune system is, and the less they are using their own glucose. They produce histamine and lactic acid in the tumor, and both of these are attractive to the fungus.

If you simply increase the pH—and do it with bicarbonate, which converts to carbon dioxide—that helps to suppress the cancer-promoting lactic acid formation by the tumor itself. So he's really onto something.

## Vitamin D and Skin Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Last month we talked about vitamin D deficiency. You mentioned that the skin's immune system and a deficiency of vitamin D in the skin, especially as people get older, plays a part in the formation of skin cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and that follows from a cholesterol deficiency. With aging, the ability to make cholesterol and steroids goes down. When sunlight hits old skin, it makes much less vitamin D.

Just a few months ago in Poland, there was an interesting article on the so-called "activated" form of vitamin D, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). They showed that the active form suppresses immunity and creates the ideal environment for causing mammary gland cancer metastasis.

**Andrew Murray:** You're saying the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is not actually the beneficial form?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that is produced under stress. It is sort of the way the steroid hormones under extreme stress can emphasize the estrogen version. Calcitriol is the extreme stress form of vitamin D. It has its use under stress, but like estrogen, it easily becomes counterproductive and, in the case of cancer, can promote the cancer spread.

**Andrew Murray:** Calcitriol is the end of the metabolic pathway for the production of vitamin D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you are well supplied with calcium and the vitamin D precursors—or sunlight and cholesterol—you have a very low level of calcitriol.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so that won't be reached if you have adequate levels of thyroid and calcium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. Like pregnenolone is the precursor of the pathway that leads to estrogen and aldosterone, but if you take enough pregnenolone, you will reduce those end products.

## Candida and Sugar Starvation

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding Simoncini's idea that *Candida albicans* is the culprit: he observed that tumors invariably had white centers, which was Candida. You've mentioned that Candida is opportunistic. In the past, you've said that you do *not* want to starve the body of sugar—which is typically what they advise for Candida—because the filamentous form is initiated when the fungal organism is deprived of sugar and wants to go further into the tissues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If it's happy in the intestine, it grows in the yeast form getting enough sugar. But when there's no sugar in the intestine and it starves, then it will attach itself to the surface of the intestine and send out filaments to find sugar from the bloodstream or the cells.

## Bicarbonate and CO2 Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** Simoncini also uses intravenous injectable sodium bicarbonate. I know you are a big fan of sodium bicarbonate and CO2.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When bicarbonate gets into the bloodstream, the sodium leaves in the urine and the bicarbonate is converted to carbon dioxide as it enters the cell. So, it acidifies the intracellular environment despite temporarily increasing the alkalinity of the bloodstream. The typical cancer metabolism has an alkaline intracellular pH. You are getting right at the heart of the problem when you increase the CO2 inside the cell.

Since the 18th century, carbon dioxide gas has been used to treat visible cancers, such as ulcerated breast cancer. The Japanese are currently using it to treat cancers using that same principle: it acidifies the cell and turns off the growth mechanism of lactic acid production. Several drug companies are working on enzyme inhibitors similar to acetazolamide to increase the internal acidity of cancers.

**Andrew Murray:** Acetazolamide is something you've said is useful for raising your own production of CO2.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it causes the body to retain it and acidifies the whole body when you get a certain amount. But intracellularly, that acidification turns off lactic acid production. Lactic acid is effectively the main carcinogen.

## Caller: Topical Skin Cancer

**Caller (Petrolia):** I have a crusty carcinoma type of thing on the back of my hands and the side of my neck. I was wondering what I could do to get rid of the scab or crust. Are you saying a 7% solution of iodine might be the solution?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes. If you go to Amazon and look at 7% iodine, read the customer reviews. Many talk about how basal or squamous cell carcinomas have gone after weeks of treatment. You can also look up Tullio Simoncini.

## Caller: Hypertonic Liquids

**Caller (Peter, San Francisco):** I've noticed a benefit from adding sugar to milk and orange juice. I'm wondering what the mechanism is for that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hypotonic liquids hitting the stomach and intestine cause a stress reaction and release serotonin into the bloodstream. Hypertonic things—if within reason, as you can injure your stomach with a big dose of salt or dry sugar—have an anti-inflammatory effect. Moderate hypertonicity helps to regulate energy production and pH. Various hypertonic solutions are being used in resuscitation now; a small volume, like a cupful of hypertonic solution, has a very intense resuscitating effect in shock.

## Caller: Cannabis Oil vs. Olive Oil for Skin Cancer

**Caller (Dirk, Redway):** My 96-year-old grandmother had a squamous cell on her nose. The doctor recommended excising it, which would have removed her entire nose. We opted against that and applied cannabis oil in an olive oil suspension. In two weeks, it went away. Do you have comments on the efficacy of the cannabis, or was it the olive oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm inclined to think it's the olive oil that is therapeutic because it has so many anti-inflammatory effects. I think the cannabis oil has some potentially pro-growth, pro-inflammatory components.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think that's the oleanolic component of the olive oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things related to cannabis—the endogenous cannabinoids like anandamide—are metabolites of very unsaturated fatty acids. The effects that I've seen really are along the line of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) themselves, which as a group are amplifiers of the estrogen effect. However, there are several things in olive oil that I think can have a protective anti-cancer effect.

## Caller: Sardines and Fungal Infections

**Caller (New York):** First, regarding PUFA: What about sardines? It's a whole fish, so you get minerals and potentially vitamin D. Is the PUFA in sardines problematic? Second, regarding Candida: If you have a fungal toe, do you have to be really healthy to attack it? Could chasing it out of your toe cause it to spread to another area?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding sardines, they have very good general nutritional value, including selenium, iodine, and other trace minerals found in ocean organisms. But it does have a lot of the polyunsaturated fats. I think maybe one meal a week is fine. Everything exposed to sunlight tends to have some vitamin D.

Regarding the fungus, I don't think it would spread if you are using something like 7% iodine on the infected nail. It takes a long time to diffuse through a toenail, but it is a good fungus killer.

## Caller: Toxic Relationships and Stress

**Caller (San Francisco Bay Area):** I was in a very toxic relationship this year involving substance abuse and lying. How do bad relationships affect individuals, and can they affect one's physiology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a very powerful stressor. Eating well can help to offset the stress, but the attitude—the way you interpret the experience—is also essential. It should be seen as just one of the challenges of living, not interpreted in any way that impairs your understanding of yourself. It should just be seen as one of the environmental challenges.

## Caller: CO2 Bags

**Caller (Finland):** I found out they are selling bags for growers that contain a fungus which generates CO2. Would it be a good idea to have those bags around the house to increase CO2 levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had a bag of Masa Harina from Mexico, and the humidity in Oregon started a fungus growth. For about a year, it was hot and producing carbon dioxide. So it is a very productive, passive way to increase the carbon dioxide in your bedroom. I don't think it emits anything seriously harmful other than the carbon dioxide, which is beneficial. If it has a cloth enclosure, I don't think it's going to put out any spores.

## Caller: Treating Candida

**Caller (Michael, Redway):** We often hear about the Candida diet which involves starving it with no sugar. Does that imply you could get cancer from it latching on? How do you get rid of the overgrowth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a pinch of flowers of sulfur. If it's internal, a pinch of it every day for three or four days is very reliable for cleaning it out of your intestine. If it's on your skin, you can rub it into the white spot. If it is in the sweaty areas, dust the area with flowers of sulfur. I had a whole-body coverage of some kind of fungus when I was in a tropical area of Mexico, and someone told me about 10% sulfur soap. One bath eradicated it. It's amazingly effective against skin Candida infections.

**Caller:** Is flowers of sulfur the same powder winemakers put on their grapes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they use a cruder, cheaper form, but yes, it's a good fungus killer on plants.

## Caller: Hashimoto’s and Blood Pressure

**Caller (Pepperwood):** I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's. My TSH was 5. My symptom is erratic blood pressure—sometimes 140s, sometimes lower. What would you suggest to support thyroid function and stabilize blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes advocated the use of temperature as an important basis for diagnosing functional hypothyroidism. In the 1940s, the drug industry introduced chemical diagnoses that were biologically meaningless but convinced everyone that 95% of the population is not hypothyroid. They eventually switched to TSH as the "gold standard," but they neglect the fact that stress lowers your TSH. You can be under such intense stress with high cortisol that your TSH can be near zero while your thyroid gland is producing nothing.

Also, TSH is an inflammation promoter. It creates hypertension by causing inflammation directly in the blood vessels. One of the effects of the thyroid hormone on your blood pressure is simply that it suppresses TSH. Many people now say the upper limit of TSH should not be higher than 2.0.

Regarding blood pressure, it is good to check your temperature and pulse rate when you first wake up and then later in the day. Broda Barnes believes the waking temperature should be close to 98°F and the mid-afternoon temperature closer to 98.6°F. In my own experience, when I stopped taking thyroid for a while, my blood pressure went up to something like 170/110, and other times as low as 55/28. I felt fine, but I got back to taking more sugar and thyroid quickly.

## Caller: Vegetables and Mushrooms

**Caller (New Jersey):** If you cook vegetables, do you get rid of the PUFA? Also, regarding mushrooms, do they have the same effect as the carrot salad and charcoal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cooked mushrooms have a fair balance of minerals. They are somewhat low in calcium, but not as bad as grains, beans, and meats. They have the fibrous effect that the carrot has of helping to sweep out the intestine just by the bulk effect.

Regarding greens, cooking them makes them more digestible so you get more protein, but greens do have too much PUFA to use them as your main food. If you cook them for hours, much of the PUFA would float to the surface and you could get some of it off, but they are still high in PUFA. The cow's digestive system uses bacteria and vitamin E to eliminate 98% of the PUFA, so it's better to process greens through cows and drink the milk. The best thing about greens is the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio; they are extremely high in calcium relative to phosphate.

**Caller:** Are root vegetables the same?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Turnips, for example, have fructose when they are young and fresh and are relatively nutritious. They have much less of a PUFA problem than the greens.
