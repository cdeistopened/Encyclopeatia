## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this evening's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. As always, Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us on the show. Tonight's subject is longevity and brain foods. Dr. Peat's latest newsletter is on cognition, which is a continuing theme of his, and we want to bring out some new thoughts surrounding that. Dr. Peat, are you there with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Just so that people who perhaps have never listened to the show or have never heard you, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background before we get into tonight's subject?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied humanities first, largely at the University of Oregon, a year at Ohio State, and some in Mexico. Then I went to the University of Oregon for four years to study biology, and I've been concentrating on biology now for 40 years or more.

## Gut Bacteria, Metabolism, and Longevity

**Andrew Murray:** Looking at longevity first, we did a show a few months back entitled "You Are What You Eat." You've written in your recent newsletter that the intestinal tract of parrots and ravens contained only a few species of bacteria, and this positively correlated with longevity in these species, the intestines being a major source of toxins. I was quite shocked because ravens are carrion birds; you would think that rotting flesh would be a source of a wide range of bacteria. What have you found about the intestinal population of bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Birds have a very high body temperature and so probably have extremely fast digestion and the ability to extract everything good from the food, taking it away from potential bacteria. It's just so fast that bacteria don't have much of a chance at multiplying. Incidentally, besides being very long-lived, those birds are extremely intelligent and can solve extremely complex problems very quickly. I think cognition and longevity go closely together.

When you cause animals to grow up their whole life free of bacteria, they have some advantage in stress resistance and have a somewhat increased average lifespan. A lot of the stuff produced by bacteria ends up simply slowing metabolism. The aging process itself, right from earliest life, is a process of slowing the metabolic rate. So, things that retard that slowing should extend lifespan as well as good cognition.

**Andrew Murray:** That reminds me of the phrase "wear and tear." The relationship between activity and running at a high metabolic rate is often thought of as running out of energy or wearing out. But this is the opposite—a highly increased metabolic rate is actually productively beneficial for the organism in terms of clearing waste material and processing reactions that would denature toxins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was in grade school and high school, it was common opinion that if you were very active and had a high metabolic rate, you would die young. That always annoyed me—that people had the image of a candle: the brighter it burns, the shorter its life expectancy.

## Polyunsaturated Fats and Brain Development

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why a baby starts out with such a high pulse rate, is so warm, and has a high metabolism, and then aging changes that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, especially at puberty, it gradually slows down. When a calf is born, for example, its fats all through its body, including its brain, are highly saturated because the mother has been saturating the fats from the food, so it's protected from the environment. As its tissues absorb the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), its metabolism slows down. You can see it in the ruminants because they start life extremely free of polyunsaturates.

According to some fat experts, human babies are born deficient in essential fatty acids, and so they advocate putting more of them in baby formula. But actually, those are major things in slowing metabolic rate. They tend to accumulate in the brain with aging, slowing metabolism, especially the ability to metabolize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. The old or demented brain has a chronically high level of lactic acid because it has progressively lost the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I find it strange that the placenta filters out the polyunsaturated fats. If the placenta filters it out, maybe the baby is not supposed to have them. So don't start giving your baby fish oil as soon as it's born.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's why babies are born with a so-called fatty acid deficiency, but that's a natural thing. The baby makes its brain fats out of the glucose or fructose that it's getting from the mother. There have been experiments with rats, dogs, and other animals in which the mother is given a high unsaturated fat diet or a PUFA-free diet. The babies have a bigger brain and better problem-solving ability when their mother was free of PUFA during gestation.

## The Pituitary and the "Death Hormone"

**Andrew Murray:** The intestines being clean prevents the accumulation of inflammatory degradative processes and contributes to a longer lifespan. How about the manipulation of hormones? W.D. Denckla did an experiment removing the pituitary gland, which was shown decisively to increase life and reduce the rate of aging. The hormones borne by the pituitary—like LH, FSH, TSH, and oxytocin—are responsible for a lot of inflammatory processes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He found that, in general, the pituitary extract, if you injected it into an animal, slowed the ability to oxidize glucose. So he called the death hormone the "oxygen blocking hormone." He tried to extract a specific protein; it was closely related to prolactin or growth hormone, but he never did identify a single protein, probably because several pituitary hormones do have some oxygen-blocking function.

Growth hormone is really an adequate model of what Denckla was looking for. It is now widely recognized that the more growth hormone you have, the shorter your life expectancy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And doctors give patients growth hormone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The famous Methuselah mouse lacks the ability to produce growth hormone. When they genetically modify mice so that they produce more than the normal amount, they are very short-lived.

You don't have to do surgery on the pituitary; you can live in a way that reduces the activity of those hormones. For example, any stress tends to sharply decrease your blood sugar until you adapt. Simply an episode of hypoglycemia increases your growth hormone. That activates the process of changing your type of metabolism, blocking oxygen production and the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide. It also tends to increase phosphate, which is one of the things that happens under the influence of bowel toxins.

**Andrew Murray:** It's the ratio of phosphates to calcium that you've always mentioned as being important. The phosphate from meats, particularly muscle meats and nuts, can be damaging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's now considered one of the most important uremic toxins in kidney disease—simply natural phosphate that everyone has circulating. But when it increases because of hormonal metabolic problems, that is a typical strong sign of the aging process. The anti-aging hormone or protein called Klotho is a very powerful regulator of the balance and handling of phosphate.

## Blood Filtration and the Bystander Effect

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about the anti-aging effect of diluting your blood serum or lymph to remove toxins. When the kidneys fail, they can damage bowel function. Is it possible that we could practically dialyze ourselves?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Animal experiments have been done for 75 years on this. One is a simple dilution experiment where they took out a dog's blood, centrifuged it, threw away the liquid part, put a saline solution back in to replace the red blood cells, and did that repeatedly. Once the whole animal's body fluids had been turned over and exchanged, a decrepit old dog—something close to 20 years old—became frisky. It was effectively rejuvenated.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bowel toxins are always entering the blood and having to be removed by the kidneys. But they poison not only the kidneys, but the heart, the brain, the liver, and the intestine in the process of being filtered out. The blood contains some of these toxins, including excess lactic acid and phosphate, as well as specific bacterial toxins.

Also, as these toxins affect the various tissues, the body produces defensive reactions. These defensive reactions, including the pituitary hormones, become part of the toxic environment circulating in the fluids. The shift away from circulating renewal signals produced by the animal becomes, with age, circulating stress signals. If you put young blood into an old animal, you're causing a slight shift back towards some of the renewal signals, but you aren't necessarily decreasing the age and stress signals.

**Andrew Murray:** That's very much like a bystander effect as well, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It definitely is the same process. When you injure a cell or a particular region—for example, with a beam of focused ionizing radiation—that tissue emits signals which are the same as the aging and stress signals. So, radiation damage is very similar to the process of aging. The intrinsic regulatory processes, instead of increasing your ability to adapt, start narrowing the way you're adapting. It creates a vicious circle where something interferes with your oxidation, leading to lactic acid production instead of carbon dioxide. Lactic acid is one of the toxins that turns on the production of nitric oxide, which spreads inflammatory signals and blocks the ability to use oxygen.

## Nitric Oxide and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** If you were to ask people on the streets whether nitric oxide was bad or good for you, I think most would say it was good.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The September issue of *Life Extension* magazine has an article on their cover: "How to Increase Your Nitric Oxide." It describes their product containing flavonoid compounds extracted from oranges. The theory they use to sell them is that they will increase your nitric oxide. I looked up what hesperidin does to nitric oxide and found 30 or 40 articles saying that these are anti-inflammatory because they *block* nitric oxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they are selling them on the premise of increasing nitric oxide, when in fact it's the opposite?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Acetylcholine and Excitotoxicity

**Andrew Murray:** Let's explore the subject of nootropics—substances for improving cognitive ability. Can you support or refute the claims made by manufacturers? Let's start with acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter responsible for memory and learning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The popular medical approach to treating Alzheimer's disease for the last 20 years is to try to increase the level of acetylcholine by blocking the enzyme that breaks it down. They've demonstrated basically that it doesn't work.

Acetylcholine is essential and part of our conscious regulating; it's needed for memory. However, it activates the enzyme that produces nitric oxide. Nitric oxide blocks energy production. This is the process of excitotoxicity, which made monosodium glutamate (MSG) notorious. A little too much MSG activates the production of too much acetylcholine, which makes too much nitric oxide. Nitric oxide poisons the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide, so it increases lactic acid. The cell has less energy and is more excited by the acetylcholine. Basically, it becomes susceptible to dying in proportion to the overstimulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is it true that MSG can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause that reaction in the brain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. The amino acids all have to get into the brain to provide brain proteins. It's just one of our normal amino acids, but too much of it becomes toxic. Aspartic acid and cysteine are the other potential nerve toxins, again by increasing acetylcholine, which increases nitric oxide and blocks oxygen metabolism.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think most people have enough acetylcholine in their systems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, actually, I think the tendency with aging is to have too much. For over 100 years, there has been evidence that overactivity of the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system produces shock. This is the system that acts primarily through acetylcholine producing nitric oxide. In shock, your blood stays red and full of oxygen, but the tissue can't use it. That happens with aging, heart failure, kidney failure, and dementia. All the tissues relatively have a shock-like metabolism that progresses with aging.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there's any medical benefit in increasing the breakdown of acetylcholine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there are therapeutic uses of things that block the overactivity of acetylcholine and accelerate its turnover. A rich environment increases the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.

**Andrew Murray:** So environmental enrichment would encourage the breakdown of acetylcholine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Having a good life protects you against lots of aging problems.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you mean by "good life"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reading interesting things, talking to interesting people.

**Andrew Murray:** And having interesting work. Liking your job not because it pays well, but because you're fundamentally interested in it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The opposite is learned helplessness or behavioral despair. Most people treat their jobs with some learned helplessness.

## Learned Helplessness and Methylation

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That brings up another product line that is being pushed recently: methylating agents. Learned helplessness is a matter of imprinting—turning off the genes that should enliven you and increase your adaptability. Too much methylation shuts things down and makes you hopeless. That process happens progressively with aging. Too much methylation turns off the genes of renewal.

There are lots of products pushing the idea that we need more methylation. One of the main methyl donors is methionine, the amino acid. If you deprive animals of a major part of their normal methionine, they live 30 or 40% longer than they would otherwise.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What's a common food source that's high in methionine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the high-protein foods, like meat.

**Andrew Murray:** So there's another good reason to advocate that muscle meats in isolation are not good for you, and that balanced proteins from the whole animal—including the connective tissue and gelatin—is the best way to consume protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, gelatin is unique in being free of the pro-aging amino acids. Another bad thing about meat is its very high ratio of phosphate to calcium.

## Heart Rate and Cognition

**Andrew Murray:** There's a sentence in your newsletter that said heart rate corresponded with academic standing, and elderly patients improved when their pacemaker was turned up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They noticed that people with a faster heart rate had higher academic records. They thought maybe it was just better brain circulation—that people with a very slow heart rate weren't getting enough oxygen to their brain. So they took patients with adjustable pacemakers and gave them mental tests when set at 70 beats per minute. Then they turned the rate up to 85 beats per minute, gave them the same tests, and they scored better in all types of brain function: memory and reasoning.

**Andrew Murray:** It's so popular in culture to believe that if you have a low pulse rate, you're healthy and super athletic. But these people with pulses of 50 beats a minute often die suddenly of heart attacks. It's a complete brainwashing that low heart rate corresponds with longevity.

## Herbal Interactions: Sage and Ginkgo

**Andrew Murray:** I want to bring out a couple of nootropics in the herb world. Sage has fairly recent articles on PubMed stating it has a cholinesterase-inhibiting property. This is the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every plant has thousands of different chemicals. Sage has components that shift the balance to increased acetylcholine action, but two of its major terpene-type chemicals are inhibitors of nitric oxide. These are very effective inhibitors of nitric oxide, so they're anti-inflammatory and pro-respiratory.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why it has an action reducing menopausal hot flashes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nitric oxide does cause flushing and is connected with hot flashes. So I think probably the dominant effect is to lower nitric oxide, whereas the cholinesterase inhibitors will tend to increase nitric oxide by stimulating the acetylcholine nerves.

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to Ginkgo, it has been used for a long time to improve cognitive function. They say it improves blood flow to the brain. I also wanted to bring out the link between monoamine oxidase (MAO) and Ginkgo. Apparently, Ginkgo decreases MAO, which increases dopamine. What are your thoughts on dopamine and MAO?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It definitely makes you feel good; it's sort of an "upper." Anything that increases your dopamine tends to increase adrenaline usually. Certain types of MAO inhibitors will increase serotonin too, and those don't necessarily go with well-being. Brain circulation, for example, is decreased by serotonin. It tightens up the blood vessels, especially the veins leaving the brain. So if you have too much serotonin, you can get brain congestion and a migraine.

I think the most important benefit of Ginkgo is that it's a very good nitric oxide inhibitor and also blocks platelet-activating factor (PAF).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And it blocks prostaglandins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, pretty generally, and they are pro-inflammatory.

## Redefining Intelligence

**Andrew Murray:** When it comes to marketing brain food as supposedly increasing your intelligence, philosophically, intelligence is not just IQ.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The "Wizard of Oz" idea is that maybe you can just go online, buy a diploma, and become intelligent and qualified. It's starting to look like the mechanical idea of qualification. You accumulate your qualifications in terms of what the culture has to sell.

The IQ idea is that there are certain mental skills that an intelligent person has. One of the silliest kinds of IQ tests had questions that were simply stories they asked people at Oxford to interpret. Then they had uneducated people interpret the same story. If you interpret it the way the Oxford graduate did, you have a high IQ.

A lot of products are being sold with the idea that if you take them, you'll become clever in ways that will make you compete in society. But if the society is set up in an irrational way, then it's not intelligent to succeed in terms that the society presents. The nootropic people are really committed to the idea of intelligence as competition to gain status. But I think there's a more general idea of consciousness and intelligence that applies to life in general: it's an appropriateness of the way you live, not the skill you have to fit into whatever you might encounter in society.

## Beneficial Supplements and Caffeine

**Andrew Murray:** There are definitely some products that promote life. You mentioned thyroid, pregnenolone, and basic anti-stress compounds. I was going to mention B12 and B1.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamins are important. And caffeine, if it's used properly. But a lot of people are thinking of caffeine as a legal version of crack cocaine. It shouldn't be used as speed; it should be used as a food. It should decrease nitric oxide exposure and so it should have anti-aging properties. But if you take it on an empty stomach, it will drop your blood sugar, turn on nitric oxide, and cause aging stress.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So have caffeine after you've had a big meal.

**Andrew Murray:** I just want to bring out one particular herb pertinent to performance enhancing: Ginseng. It falls under the umbrella of adaptogens, a term coined by Russian research when they were looking for alternatives to drugs. They found that adaptogens improved the organism's resistance to stress.

We are coming to the end of the show. Dr. Peat's website, [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com), is full of fully referenced articles. It's a very good starting point to look at his research. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** Good night.
