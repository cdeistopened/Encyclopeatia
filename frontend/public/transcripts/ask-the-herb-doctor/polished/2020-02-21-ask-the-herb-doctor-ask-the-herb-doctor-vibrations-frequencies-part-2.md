# Ask Your Herb Doctor – February 2020

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray and I'm delighted to be back on the show joining the incredibly knowledgeable Dr. Peat and my wonderful husband.

**Andrew Murray:** We are still able to entreat Dr. Peat to join us on the show to share his wisdom. Last month, very briefly, we were discussing resonant frequencies and the effects of frequencies on cells. I came across a lot of interesting abstracts from 2019 and 2020 related to extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic frequencies.

One of the main studies that caught my eye was regarding the treatment of breast cancer. They showed it was effective as an adjunctive therapy to traditional cancer management and had very significant cell-killing effects. We also touched a little bit on Rife therapy and vaccines in the past. Dr. Peat has a newsletter on vaccines in context which we will get to later.

Dr. Peat, let's introduce you to the show. For people who haven't heard your name or know anything about you, would you give an outline of your academic profession and background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After graduating from college and getting a master's degree in humanities and studying linguistics for several years, I decided to study brain biology for a PhD. When I got to the University of Oregon, I quickly decided that brain biology was a dogmatic topic at the time. I looked around and found reproductive physiology was actually doing empirical science. So, I did my dissertation on reproductive physiology and the changes aging makes in the energy metabolism of the reproductive organs.

## Vitamin E and Aging

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned that reproductive biology hadn't been swallowed up by the machine at that point.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main professor in female reproduction, Arnold Soderwall, had been working in the field way back in the 40s. He was one of the early people to test the effects of Vitamin E on reproduction. In the 1930s and 40s, it was considered a sex-promoting vitamin, or almost a hormone. He was one of the people that showed that its effect on increasing fertility took place by being an anti-estrogen.

The older an animal got, the earlier it became infertile. He found that by increasing the dose of Vitamin E steadily with aging, he kept the animals from miscarrying well into old middle age. I continued that research and found that it was partly acting by way of improving the production of progesterone as well as lowering the effect of estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I also remember you telling me about those flamingos in the African Rift Valley that don't age reproductively because they have so much CO2 from the elevation and the non-PUFA algae they're eating.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one is really sure, but I think the high carbon dioxide environment is very likely a big part of it. Their usual mortality curve is a semi-plateau up until middle age, and then it crashes. The mortality rate per year for most organisms increases rapidly after a certain age. With flamingos, it seems that all through their whole lifespan, the annual mortality continues at just about the same rate, mainly by accidents.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And they can breed up until they die from an accident?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Apparently, yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** When you were doing your PhD, what forms of Vitamin E did they know of then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I found a bottle of the very old stuff in the freezer in the lab in 1968 or so. It had been there for decades. It was a very viscous material and a light amber color. I tested it against some of the quinones. Comparing benzoquinone, for example, reacting it with Vitamin E and doing a combination staining experiment, I got chemical reactions that showed that the sensitivity of the quinone reaction was very vivid in that old sample. In the newer samples of so-called pure Vitamin E, I haven't been able to see that same reaction that I got around 1970 using the very old stuff.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Where did they get that Vitamin E from? How did they process it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was bought from Sigma Chemical Co., but it was fairly typical at the time. It was the highest grade available. At that time, all Vitamin E was fairly brown colored and very thick. Some of the studies suggested that it was a waxy, highly saturated, long-chain fatty acid that was part of the endurance-promoting antioxidant effect, not the simple tocopherol itself.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it makes a big difference what form of Vitamin E they're using to test. Does that mean we need to be careful when supplementing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even 10 or 20 years ago, the majority of it was highly diluted with soybean oil—highly unsaturated. That is exactly what my professor found was the antagonistic effect; Vitamin E protected against the pro-aging effect of the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if your Vitamin E is thin and liquid, it's probably not good. If it's thick and viscous, can we assume that's better quality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Andrew Murray:** What makes a good quality Vitamin E supplement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the mixture of the non-racemic natural forms—alpha and gamma are probably the most important. But I think the mixture as it occurs in nature is much better than any of the synthetic D,L-alpha that has been sold for a long time because it's cheap to make.

**Andrew Murray:** What about wheat germ oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is very full of polyunsaturated fat. I tried some of it in the 1970s and that caused a choking sensation when you took just a little bit of it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you're recommending a mixed tocopherol supplement, not just isolated D-alpha tocopherol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In the 1940s, the anti-estrogen, anti-clotting, and pro-fertility qualities were clearly identified. But with the rise of the estrogen industry starting in 1940, the idea that Vitamin E could be the main fertility vitamin and simultaneously purely anti-estrogenic really put a crimp in the estrogen advertising idea. They were a major factor in creating the doctrine that Vitamin E's action is merely as an antioxidant.

The vegetable oil industry at the same time was trying to sell the idea that seed oils are edible. In feeding them to animals, they were finding that animals became sterile on a high intake of the various seed oils.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't they put on weight too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but when they had a really high proportion, they became sterile and the brain deteriorated. My professor identified that as an estrogen-promoting effect. It has continued to be confirmed that estrogen increases the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the body and increases their activity. Those fats simultaneously increase the effect of estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** It's a vicious cycle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So the anti-estrogen effect was identical to the anti-PUFA effect. But both the seed oil industry and the estrogen industry found it convenient to sell the idea that Vitamin E is merely an antioxidant. From the 1940s on, D-alpha tocopherol was identified as the standard because it was the most antioxidant. But it turns out that the gamma and others have very distinct, more important biological activities, including opposition to estrogen.

## EMF, Altitude, and Healing

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to the electromagnetic fields (EMF) discussion. I saw a study on rats regarding high altitude stress and ulcer healing. They said low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields could penetrate stomach tissue and promote regeneration.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In that particular experiment, they were using restraint stress to produce the ulcers and happened to combine it with high altitude. So I don't think anything can be inferred from that study for humans. If you're being suspended by your tail at high altitude, you're going to be stressed out.

**Andrew Murray:** Another study was titled "The Neuroprotective Effects of Low Frequency Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields in Ischemic Stroke." This seems related to reducing inflammatory sequelae after an ischemic event.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They mentioned some of the inflammatory cytokines that are reduced by the treatment. Behind those protective changes, I think there's likely to be an increase of some of the basic defensive factors such as heat shock protein. Any kind of stress will bring on these stabilizing proteins. I suspect those are behind the reductions of the inflammatory mediators. Another acute stress-induced protective factor is Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF), which tends to come up at the same time as the heat shock proteins. These help nerve cells get through intense stress, such as glucose or oxygen deprivation.

**Andrew Murray:** How do these electromagnetic fields generate this healing event? How does that actually work physically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Robert Becker's research in biological electrical activity found that organisms are responsive to extremely weak electromagnetic signals, such as pulsations in the earth's electromagnetic field. Older research in the 40s and 50s found that all sorts of organisms govern their metabolic rate by changes picked up from the electromagnetic field.

Currently, the doctrine is that it's simply the light and dark changes that are cueing in the expression of genes. But in this older research, they would put the organism in sealed chambers out of sight of night and day. Some of the changes persisted even in mine shafts 60 feet below the surface. So there are some very penetrating electromagnetic fields that are crucially important for the cycles of plants. The current dogma is really trying to cover up that extreme sensitivity to weak fields and how important it is that we're being bombarded with polluting electrical rhythms.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw another article regarding Alzheimer's using 5 Hertz cycles, showing improvement in cognitive ability and tissue regeneration via heat shock proteins. Another on bacterial infections showed that pulsed EMF blocked tumor necrosis factor and transcription factor kappa beta, slowing down previously untreatable infections.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, would you recommend a practical approach to using these ELF and pulsed EMF treatments?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there has been enough research. It's clear that these acute treatments can stimulate increased blood circulation and defensive heat shock proteins, but regarding the long-range developmental course, I don't think there's enough information yet.

There is very little interest in following up research that was done 40 or 50 years ago on sound. For example, the dogma says that ordinary speaking frequency sound waves couldn't possibly be interacting with cell chemistry. But several experiments have demonstrated that moderate volume music or speech vibrations affect the activity of muscle enzymes. ATPase, for example, was found to distinctly activate at the pitch A440. Each enzyme probably has its own responsive frequency.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we're supposed to speak to each other, hear voices, and listen to music?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the pitch affects enzyme activity.

## Caller: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

**Caller:** I've been dealing with a chronic problem for a while that pushes me to my limits of mental ability because of a traumatic brain injury. I wonder what Dr. Peat has to say about organic damage to one's brain as far as any of this new research goes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think when the brain has any inefficiency from whatever cause, it's more susceptible to interference from being around a broadcast station, for example. The healthier the brain is, the higher its threshold is to that kind of pollution.

The healing influence of the natural hormones proceeds at any age. In traumatic brain injury, they found that progesterone and Vitamin D are both extremely helpful for facilitating repair and keeping down the inflammatory processes that would amount to scar formation rather than the creation of new functioning nerve circuits.

**Caller:** Where do you get progesterone? Is that something that would be prescribed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There might be three or four doctors in the country who are willing to prescribe those things, but it isn't necessary to have a prescription for them. It's the same molecule that your brain manufactures. The brain has the highest concentration of progesterone of any tissue in the body. It's an essential brain-stabilizing molecule.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It is usually synthesized from wild yam as a starting material.

## Caller: Hulda Clark's Machine

**Caller:** What do you know, if anything, about Dr. Hulda Clark's machine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think Hulda Clark's apparatus was a simple direct current device. Robert Becker's research found that he could promote nerve regeneration and establish normal function when nerves had been cut using direct current. However, regarding the use that Hulda Clark made of her device, I don't think there was any research supporting the things she claimed for it.

## Caller: Vaccines and Adjuvants

**Caller:** I'm calling on behalf of my husband who works in the medical field. He was recently denied an influenza vaccination exemption request. Since these healthcare workers have compulsory annual flu vaccination with toxic adjuvants, are there any changes you would recommend to diet or supplementation around the time of vaccination to mitigate the effects of adjuvants on systemic inflammation? For example, is it safe to increase aspirin intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same things that will protect you against injury from radiation, trauma, or bacterial toxins can be used to protect against the aluminum particulate matter and other random proteins contaminating vaccines. Aspirin is an important one. Progesterone and the youth-associated steroids—pregnenolone and DHEA—are protective against the whole range of inflammatory processes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What kind of doses would you recommend on aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the day or two before and following vaccination, probably 500 milligrams per day would be good.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that would require some Vitamin K2 as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Vitamin K is another generally protective factor. Calcium, sodium, and magnesium also have a basic anti-inflammatory function when you get them through good food.

## Caller: Dr. Pawluk Resource

**Caller:** I wanted to share that there is a site online, Dr. Pawluk (drpawluk.com). He has done extensive research on pulsed electromagnetic fields. His latest blog from February 10, 2020, talks about traumatic brain injury.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for sharing that.

## Caller: Spices and Digestion

**Caller:** How do spices help our digestive system? Do they help our cells take in nutrients?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain is in control of your digestive system. That was Pavlov's basic research. If you have negative thoughts or anxiety, you'll have digestive problems. The spices that stimulate salivation will stimulate secretion in your stomach and small intestine and make everything digest optimally. However, some spices happen to be allergenic for some people, so you have to be cautious.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Bitter herbs are very useful at increasing digestive enzymes and stomach acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The bitters work on multiple levels, stimulating your nerves, and some of them actually improve mitochondrial energy production. Some of them have systemic sedative and stabilizing effects. They can be very important to your general health.

## Caller: Scalar Energy and Gilbert Ling

**Caller:** Dr. Peat, were you referring earlier to scalar energy, also known as zero-point energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The stabilizing hormones, nutrients, and physical factors—thyroid hormone, progesterone, pregnenolone, carbon dioxide—all tend to stabilize around the 70 to 90 millivolt resting potential. But the high-energy state really is a quiescent state.

**Caller:** My other question relates to Dr. Gilbert Ling and his Association Induction Hypothesis. Is health analyzed at the cellular level or the nano-protoplasmic unit level?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Ling's view, the cell is a unified phase which doesn't have the properties of a random solution, but a single unified, functional sort of personality that goes through basic changes that organize its function.

## Milk and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** I had an email from someone concerned that most dairy cattle are kept in a permanently pregnant state. He was wondering about the potential estrogen load of milk.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is an anti-milk lobby that makes a lot of publicity to direct people away from milk. But if you look at the consumption of milk over the last 50 years, there's a tremendous decrease. More and more people are shifting to vegetable milk substitutes. During this time, looking at the population, you see a tremendous increase in premature puberty in girls and a great increase in gynecomastia in boys and men as the milk consumption decreases.

One of the reasons milk tends to have an overall protective effect against estrogen is that the estrogens in milk are in a detoxified form. Estrone sulfate, for example, is the least harmful form of estrogen. It is not at all comparable to the estrogens that are in the soy milk substitutes.
