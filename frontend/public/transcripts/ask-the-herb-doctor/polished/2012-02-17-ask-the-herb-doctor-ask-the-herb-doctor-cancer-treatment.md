## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herbal extracts.

You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's topic: the misunderstandings in the approach to cancer treatment. We are very fortunate to introduce Dr. Raymond Peat, who has done recent work on the misunderstandings in cancer treatment. In light of President Nixon's 1971 address to fight the "War on Cancer," we've made almost no real advances in cancer therapy, unlike other diseases. Cancer is now almost the number one killer, very close to cardiovascular disease.

Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us. For those who haven't heard of you, could you give an outline of your academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology about 40 years ago at the University of Oregon. Since then, I've been writing my newsletter and books, and occasionally doing seminars for medical professionals. Over the years, I've been thinking about the medical culture and what makes it so wrong.

When I was in graduate school in 1968 or '69, we had a seminar on cancer biology. My part was to explain carcinogenesis—what things cause cancer and how they work. I listed 50 different types of carcinogenic agents, including inert objects embedded in tissues, distilled water, and psychological stress. The professors were greatly annoyed because their whole point was to work out the ways that mutations are carcinogenic. They wanted me to talk about polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons causing mutations, but that was just one very small section of what I covered.

Those biologists were still fairly in harmony with the medical view of cancer. But since then, with the cloning and stem cell research of the last 10 years, biology has strongly turned away from that understanding. The active research in cancer is now more in tune with the biology of stem cells rather than mutations.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you find that to be a more accurate approach to understanding cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When I did that seminar, I was gathering research that was 30 or 40 years old at the time, but it was outside academic preferences. Since then, because of the changes in the gene industry, they've looked for natural events to parallel their genetic engineering. They've had to be open to people like Barbara McClintock, who showed that stress mutates corn plants. That opened up the whole issue of psychological factors in the development of cancer and how stress affects immunity.

## The Failure of the Genetic Theory

**Andrew Murray:** Given that the last 40 years have yielded very little in promising approaches to cancer treatment or survival rates, and given the opinion that there is a multi-billion dollar industry focused on patentable treatments rather than cures, why was the direction of excising tumors and radiating tissue chosen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For decades, people in the alternative health business have asked how doctors can forbid experimental treatments to themselves or their families. But it is such a deep cultural thing that they really believe it. They are trained in medical school in a boot camp atmosphere where they don't have time to get philosophical. They are drilled with ideas of genetic determinism.

It was less than 200 years ago that it was discovered that people are made of cells. Shortly after, they discovered cancer is made of cells. Then came the germ theory and the atomic theory, and everything fit into this reductionist approach—explaining things by the subunits they are made of. This fit the idea that a cancer is made of "bad" cells.

When genetics came up 100 years ago, it was used to explain what is different about cancer cells. The doctrine became that they are a special kind of cell explained by a mutated gene, making them completely alien to ourselves. It’s like a new being has come into existence.

The old tradition, going back to the Greeks, was to cut a tumor off or burn it off. Medicine fit the idea of the "alien cell" into that tradition of cutting something out. It was perfectly reinforcing: it is something that is not part of us and must be eliminated.

## Field Theory and the Environment

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** While that was happening, other people were studying metabolism and physiology. They saw that there are fields governing the relationship of cells in a developing embryo—electrical gradients and chemical fields. If you cut a piece of an embryo, or even an adult animal, you could see a wave of cell division spread out from the injury to replace the cells.

The idea of a cancer field was being demonstrated in the 1930s and 40s. They showed that if you found a cancer in the intestine, and examined rings around the cancer, you would find gradients of abnormality grading off to normal. The center was outright cancer, but the surrounding tissue showed inflammation and deterioration.

However, the molecular revolution came about with a great push from the government, and the DNA doctrine was used to explain everything. They said information comes only from the gene to the cell. When virologists demonstrated reverse transcriptases (RNA viruses), my professors wouldn't believe it because they said information only comes from the gene. Since then, biology has changed, but medicine is still stuck on the idea of the alien, mutated clone of cells.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It sounds like the argument between Louis Pasteur and Antoine Béchamp. Pasteur said it was the bug, and Béchamp said it was the *terroir*—the environment of the body—that determines infection.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but medicine didn't agree. By the time the DNA molecule became stylish, medicine had locked itself into that view. Interestingly, around 1950, there was an article about a man injecting cancer into hundreds of prisoners and patients. He found that if he injected cancer into a sick person, it wouldn't be thrown off immediately like in a healthy person. If he injected it into a person who already had cancer, it would sometimes persist. He concluded there is something in the body that either favors cancer or resists and destroys it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Were they wanting cancer to be something our bodies had no control over—just defective genes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The doctrine says once one cell mutates, it produces a clone, and you have to destroy it. But when you actually look at cancers, they are often polyclonal. Within the cancer, there are zones of "bad" and "worse."

Several people have analyzed cancer closely and found that tissue can be perfectly normal and functioning yet contain more than 1,000 mutated genes. A typical cancer has hundreds of mutated genes before it starts going bad.

Forty years ago, researchers stored bits of cancer tissue in a deep freeze. When they thawed them in the presence of structuring solvents like DMSO or butyrates, the tissue would revert to normal. In another experiment, they took tumor cells from hamsters and mixed them with cells from a normal embryo. The developing embryo normalized the tumor cells, producing a perfectly normal hamster.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That disproves the theory that cancers are purely a defective gene. If you can inject a cancer cell into a growing embryo and get a normal animal, the organism is in control.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. Harry Rubin, Ana Soto, and Carlos Sonnenschein have made the point that the organism is in control for most of the life of the cancer. At some point, the organism loses control, and that's when it becomes a functioning cancer.

## Preventing Cancer: Light and Metabolism

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What can we do to create an environment in our body that prevents cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything you do is either anti-carcinogenic or carcinogenic. For example, if you avoid sunlight or use sunscreens because you are afraid of skin cancer, the avoidance of sun is very carcinogenic.

**Andrew Murray:** There was a report in England recently that rickets is becoming prevalent again because people are using high SPF sunscreen on their children.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't just the Vitamin D; it is the penetrating light. For 50 years, people have studied the effects of red light. The basic effect of penetrating red light is to activate the respiratory enzyme—mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. This enzyme is restored by red light.

In rabbit experiments, this enzyme is pretty well destroyed by just 12 to 15 hours of darkness. Mortality goes up at the end of winter because nights are longer. Whether using lasers, incandescent lights, or sunlight, red light penetrates the body and restores the energy-producing enzymes.

Otto Warburg in 1929 demonstrated that cancer differs metabolically from healthy cells by turning glucose into lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen. This happens because something has gone wrong with the mitochondrion. All you have to do to create that metabolism is knock out the cytochrome oxidase enzyme.

Everything that is carcinogenic weakens that enzyme: the wrong kind of fat (PUFA), an imbalance of estrogen to progesterone, thyroid deficiency, or ionizing radiation. Ultraviolet light destroys it in the skin, but sunlight is balanced because the red light restores the enzyme that the UV is destroying. If you avoid sunburn, the sun is a pure benefit.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Especially this time of year, are you talking about intermittent exposure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ideally. Animal experiments show the enzyme gets damaged by eight hours of darkness. We shouldn't be in total darkness for longer than it takes to sleep.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do low-energy fluorescent bulbs vary from incandescent bulbs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those little fluorescent things are going to cause an epidemic of cancer. The beneficial red light comes from incandescent bulbs and sunlight.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You’ve recommended that office workers have a 250 to 300-watt incandescent bulb shining over their workstation. How much skin exposure is needed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As much as possible. For people with brain disease or motor neuron disease, shining it on the head, neck, and back is crucial. But getting the whole body exposed is best because you are sending remedial signals through the nervous system that help stabilize enzymes in cells that aren't getting direct light.

## Inflammation and Energy

**Andrew Murray:** We understand inflammation is not a good thing. Is inflammation a major part of cancer progression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Everything that is stressful promotes inflammation. Even things like dropping your blood sugar works the same as cutting off the oxygen supply. It keeps that crucial oxidative enzyme from getting energy from glucose. In the absence of sugar, oxygen, or carbon dioxide, that enzyme fails. The cell produces lactic acid defensively, which triggers chain reactions, causes fats to break down, and produces prostaglandins, leading to more inflammation. Basically, you must keep your energy up so you can respire efficiently.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So small, frequent meals will help prevent that chain reaction.

## Caller Questions: Light Sources

**Michael (Announcer):** A listener asks: What about red LEDs, tanning beds, and far-infrared saunas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Red LEDs have been demonstrated to reverse many changes of cancer and are being used experimentally. Lasers, incandescent light, sunlight, and LEDs all activate that enzyme efficiently, specifically between 600 and 700 nanometers (orange to red).

**Michael:** How about a far-infrared sauna?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is some benefit, and the heat itself is beneficial, but the specific restoration of the enzyme happens in the orange-to-red spectrum.

**Michael:** And a tanning bed would be pure ultraviolet with no benefit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically. You get Vitamin D, but without the protective red and orange light, it will have a slight immune-suppressive effect. It's better to get your suntan in real sunlight.

## Cellular Excitation

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to cell excitation. We normally look at an excited state as beneficial, but how does this relate to cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An energized cell is actually relaxed. Imagine muscles ready to work; they are soft and flexible. If you work them to fatigue, they swell and cramp. The presence of adequate energy relaxes nerves and muscles.

If you are deficient in energy production—because the mitochondrial enzyme is impaired or thyroid is low—it doesn't take much stress to de-energize the cell. A cell that has had more stimulation than it can meet with energy production will swell up, just like a tired muscle. In that state, it releases lactic acid, histamine, and prostaglandins.

If you are chronically low energy, you are susceptible. A tissue like the breast, uterus, or liver that experiences stimulation will shift to glycolysis and produce lactic acid if it can't produce enough energy to return to a relaxed state.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that how you would describe a seizure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the cell is over-excited and can't relax. A cramp is the same thing. People are more likely to have seizures or cramps at night because darkness impairs our respiratory enzymes, bringing us closer to the threshold where excitation can't be turned off.

## Surgery and Metastasis

**Andrew Murray:** If someone gets a cancer diagnosis but hasn't had surgical intervention, what is the rationale that cutting into that area is dangerous?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A professor at the University of California about 60 years ago compared people who declined medical treatment with those who got the best available, and those who declined lived longer.

There is a website by a man named Gershom Zajicek (Z-A-J-I-C-E-K) who presents evidence that cutting out a tumor activates metastases that had been sitting harmlessly. Even some professors acknowledge that cutting out a tumor often causes metastatic growth to spring up. Published studies show people get recurrences much sooner if they have surgery than if they don't.

**Michael:** A caller asks: What about cutting out polyps during routine colonoscopies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's pretty harmless. If you didn't look for them, I think they would fall off by themselves. They aren't deeply entrenched.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about cutting off moles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is one of the things well established to cause others to pop up. Zajicek talks about that on his website.

## The Bystander Effect

**Andrew Murray:** So when the body is energy-depleted, it loses the battle against malformed cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. This relates to the "bystander effect." For 50 years, they believed radiation caused cancer by mutating DNA directly. But recently, they noticed that if you irradiate cells in a dish and then put new cells in, the new cells mutate. Or if you mutate one cell, it sends out substances like serotonin, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide.

In your body, you don't have to mutate a gene by hitting it with radiation directly. You just have to stress a cell so it emits these substances. Your whole body experiences bystander effects. A study in Seattle found that dental X-rays caused pregnant women to have underdeveloped babies even with lead shielding on the abdomen. The bystander effect from the face and brain poisoned the rest of the body.

## Caller Questions: Taxol and Essiac

**Michael:** A listener asks about Taxol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it has some anti-inflammatory effects which probably account for the good it does, but there are less toxic things that do more good.

**Michael:** Could you comment on the Essiac formula?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm sure it has some of those same anti-inflammatory effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It has liver herbs in it, which helps the liver clear excess hormones.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The crucial respiratory enzyme is protected by progesterone and inactivated by estrogen. One of the oldest bystander effects known is that if you radiate any part of an animal, it will go into heat as if given a shot of estrogen. Any inflammation activates the aromatase enzyme, which makes estrogen. In studies of monkeys, they found that the arms were producing at least as much estrogen as the ovaries. So, a person isn't protected against estrogen just because they have had menopause or ovaries removed. Every part of the body that is stressed becomes an estrogen factory.

**Michael:** Assuming you were going through chemo and radiation, what danger is that to people around you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are starting to recommend that people taking radioactive iodine for thyroid treatment not ride on buses because they are radiating people around them. If you get radiation at the hospital, it won't hurt anyone else later, but if you have radioactive substances in your system (like iodine), you are radioactive.

## Diagnosis and Metastasis

**Andrew Murray:** Do you have comments on metastasis of cancer that hasn't been surgically intervened with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, metastases are great for business. Now they are saying maybe breast cancer starts *in utero*. The idea of "metastatic little aliens" is tremendous for business because you can never prove they aren't there. If you injure a person enough, you're going to find some.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wasn't there a study showing that 100% of people over age 50 who died in accidents had some form of abdominal cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, Harry Rubin mentioned that. Similar studies show that if you look at just two or three organs—breast, uterus, prostate—you find cancer in a high percentage. By age 50, everyone can have it diagnosed.

I think that means be careful about getting a diagnosis. Dentists told me twice when I was about 30 that I had precancerous leukoplakia and should have it biopsied. Since I knew I got lumpy developments in my cheeks when deficient in Vitamin A, I took Vitamin A instead. I cured it in a week.

I told women with abnormal Pap smears and "carcinoma in situ" about that. They applied Vitamin A topically. I kept track of three dozen women; all of them went back to their doctors later with no evidence of abnormality. The doctors lost out on a good hysterectomy, and in every case, they didn't want to know what the women had done.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Natural sources of Vitamin A are eggs and liver. Beta carotene relies on a conversion that isn't very efficient, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are deficient in thyroid hormone or Vitamin B12, you don't convert beta carotene into Vitamin A.
