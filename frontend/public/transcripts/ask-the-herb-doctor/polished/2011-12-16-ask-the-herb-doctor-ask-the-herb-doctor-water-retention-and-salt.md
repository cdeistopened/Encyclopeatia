## Introduction: Salt, Inflammation, and Diuretics

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we offer alternative medicine and nutritional counseling.

This month we want to explore the misconceptions surrounding water retention and the medical advice to avoid salt, as well as the over-prescription of diuretics. We will make special reference to toxemia of late pregnancy and the role of inflammation and poor energy reserves as a cause for concern. We're going to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat.

This month's show is going to be mainly looking at the topics of salt avoidance with respect to water retention and opening up that misconception with facts and science supporting the use of salt—rather than the avoidance of salt—for decreasing water retention. We will also look at Dr. Tom Brewer's pioneering research work on toxemia of late pregnancy. For those women listening, a noteworthy part of the show will be based on that toxemia and the things that Dr. Brewer proved reduce swelling and actually reduce the occurrence of toxemia completely.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray, and I'm joining Andrew Murray. We have Dr. Raymond Peat on the line.

**Andrew Murray:** Hi, Dr. Peat. Thank you for joining us again to illuminate the way through the misconceptions that we so often repeat as truth. Would you please describe your academic and professional background for listeners who perhaps have never heard your name?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology and physiology at the University of Oregon and have taught various hormone and nutrition-related courses, as well as in other fields, psychology and philosophy included.

## The Problem with Modern Diuretics

**Andrew Murray:** Your main interests have been looking into hormones, and much of your research has given you new insights into the treatment of many situations with hormones like progesterone, pregnenolone, and others. Perhaps we should start with modern diuretics. We come into contact with people using diuretics to decrease water retention, whether it's ankles, fingers, or cardiac water retention. Are there any safe diuretics that are prescription medications?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are some that are relatively safe, but it's the whole theory behind why they exist that is the problem. Mercury compounds used to be used; basically, they just killed the kidney cells and let stuff leak out. They were the common diuretics for a very long time until the 1950s, when new compounds came on the market that had a variety of effects on the kidneys. It was really the promotion of those that created an ideology that diuretics are key to treating heart disease and several other problems, such as toxemia of pregnancy. But really, I think it's mostly a marketing strategy to orient physiology around making the kidneys leak out more water.

The real problem is what causes the water retention. Almost anything that seriously injures the organism causes water retention. For example, a problem following surgery is that the person stops forming urine. Shock, or any very serious sickness, is going to cause the reduced ability to form urine properly. It's sort of a plumber's approach to physiology to think of just opening up the kidneys and letting the liquid out faster.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** From a herbal perspective, dandelion leaf—and the root is a little bit less effective than the leaf—works as a diuretic. That's what I thought they had created Furosemide from. Although with Furosemide, I know you have to have a prescription of potassium along with it. Dandelion leaf has a lot of potassium, so you don't need to take extra potassium if you use it. Would you consider Furosemide a safe diuretic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's got a long history of use, and it probably does have an actual beneficial effect on survival. But with almost any leaf extract, the potassium and magnesium are going to have a diuretic effect that is probably safer than the actual drug function on the kidneys.

**Andrew Murray:** So the inflammation in the first place is the main cause for the cessation of diuresis and the increase in water retention in the cells through damage.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You're saying it's much more important to look at what's causing that inflammation rather than just prescribe a diuretic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even before the inflammation, there's the energy problem. Something as simple as drinking too much water in relation to the energy your body is producing can cause issues. For example, a low-thyroid person who can't produce much metabolic energy is very susceptible to drinking too much water and getting a very general disruption of their physiology.

A pint or so of water passing suddenly through your stomach to your intestine causes a surge of serotonin release. That is simply a model of stress or shock. Just a surge of water hitting the intestine is enough to increase serotonin, which then stimulates the production of prolactin. Prolactin is associated with water retention. Serotonin increases the production of aldosterone, which produces water retention and inflammation and sets off a chain of reactions that lead to things such as heart failure.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The unfortunate thing is when someone is low thyroid, they're usually very thirsty all the time anyway. They crave that water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It causes the tissues to retain water. Even though it's passing through the kidneys mostly, and they aren't producing much evaporation through their lungs or skin, it tends to leak out of their bloodstream into the tissues and produce edema. Edema is harmful to all of the tissues. It turns on a whole anabolic system, shifting away from oxidative metabolism, activating lipolysis (the release of fatty acids), and shifting cell metabolism towards burning fat rather than sugar. This imitates diabetes and aging. It's a generalized shock physiology that's involved when cells get waterlogged. It can start with low thyroid, but it feeds back and makes the low thyroid problem worse.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why you said that any kind of leaf extract or tea is going to have minerals in it that help prevent this from happening. And if you made a cup of tea, you'd sip on it slowly; you wouldn't just drink it down like a pint of water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And regarding the minerals, it isn't essential that it be magnesium and potassium; calcium and sodium have many of the same functions. If you're in shock, you can relieve the symptoms pretty much by taking more of any one of the alkaline minerals: potassium, sodium, magnesium, or calcium. In heart failure and lung inflammation—many of the things that happen with shock or aging—the lungs and the heart tend to get waterlogged and lose function. Just giving a very concentrated salt solution intravenously will relieve the symptoms. Very often they've doubled the survival or cut the mortality rate in half by just giving extra sodium intravenously.

## The Salt Misconception and Toxemia

**Andrew Murray:** Why is it so often that doctors tell people to avoid salt? Why is salt so maligned as a problem element, especially when people are swelling?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It really got a big boost around 1950 when the diuretics came on the market. They found the diuretics took sodium out at the same time they took water out. So they said you should get the same effect by restricting the sodium intake. They applied that to pregnant women. Tom Brewer and some other people wrote about the horrible effects of sodium restriction in pregnancy, plus using diuretics. If you combine the two, you get doubly bad, serious effects.

After I had been reading Tom Brewer's work for a long time, I was seeing similarities between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and the toxemia of pregnancy that he had worked on. I finally decided to suggest to young women who were having premenstrual water retention—and not having any good results just by stopping their salt intake—that they follow Brewer's prescription to *increase* their salt intake when they were having edema problems, and to go according to their craving for salt. The first person that tried it had a total avoidance of premenstrual water retention the very first month.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How much salt did she take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Quite a lot. Even if the food was already salted, she would just add lots more onto it. It absolutely stopped right from then on. She never had a water retention problem again.

**Andrew Murray:** Where do you think the mistaken ideology has come from that salt increases the risk of stroke and heart attack?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** David McCarron, 30 or 40 years ago, was studying the issue. He looked at the figures that the government published recommendations were based on. He thought that if you look at the figures carefully, the people who ate the *least* salt had the highest blood pressure, and the people who ate the *most* salt had the lowest blood pressure. He saw that the figures really showed that low calcium intake was associated with hypertension, and the sodium was really there as an innocent bystander associated with the calcium deficiency.

**Andrew Murray:** So you're saying that calcium deficiency is more responsible for hypertension?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. David McCarron has written maybe 150 articles on the subject. I think he was at a California university when he started saying it's not high sodium, it's low calcium that causes hypertension. I think that university invited him to leave.

## Calcium, Arteries, and Hypertension

**Andrew Murray:** Am I thinking right when you've mentioned in the past that low calcium intakes cause calcium to leak out of the bones and into the blood, and that causes the calcification of the arteries eventually, which gives you hypertension?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The essential idea is that low calcium intake, among other things, increases your parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH pulls calcium out of your bones and favors its movement into cells of all kinds. When calcium is taken up by cells, it stimulates them and tends to make them contract.

That's one of the places that thyroid and energy production comes into the question. Carbon dioxide, produced by the action of thyroid, keeps calcium *out* of cells. Even if you breathe in a bag to increase your carbon dioxide, or take baking soda, the carbon dioxide will relax your blood vessels by helping the calcium to move out of the blood vessels and back into the bones.

**Andrew Murray:** So short-term exposure to higher blood levels of calcium, or tissues picking up the calcium, contributes to that lack of elasticity characteristic of high blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Each of these things sets in motion a whole sequence of events. Low carbon dioxide lets calcium get into cells and excite them and tighten up the blood vessels. Low carbon dioxide also lets the platelets release their serotonin. The serotonin, besides adding to the tension of the blood vessels, makes them permeable and leaky, so that the water isn't retained in the bloodstream but leaks through into the cells. The cells that are taking up calcium are also taking up water.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So basically, 2,000 milligrams of calcium is a really important thing for somebody with hypertension to start implementing into their regime.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and supporting it with the other minerals. The facts that David McCarron looked at showed that the high salt eaters actually had lower blood pressure. One of the things involved there is that sodium helps stimulate the cell to expel calcium. Sodium activates the thyroid function, and the thyroid function pushes calcium out of the cell and lets the cell relax.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I know it's a little bit confusing for our listeners, talking about calcium inside and outside of cells. Basically, the salt helps to put the calcium where it should be and not be deposited in your arteries.

## Brewer Diet and Safe Diuretics

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the diet that Tom Brewer brought about for the treatment of toxemia of late pregnancy—a diet which resulted in none of his thousands of patients ever getting toxemia—he was very big on drinking quite a bit of milk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There's the calcium. Also salt and lots of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, he was talking about the protein and adding salt to your food. But the milk has other things besides the protein. The calcium has its direct effect on blood pressure, and the sugar of milk has a diuretic-like action. So the calcium and sugar add to the quality of the protein.

**Andrew Murray:** We talked a little bit about Furosemide. Are there any safer, effective diuretics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you think of the sequence of stress effects I mentioned—too much water leading to too much serotonin, aldosterone, and prolactin—those are all inflammatory and cause water retention. If you choose your substances with reference to inhibiting any or all of those, that's going to be an anti-edema, anti-inflammatory treatment.

Thyroid and progesterone, for example, lower all of these things. Progesterone is a very powerful antagonist to aldosterone. Drugs are being developed to be very similar to progesterone but patentable, so they can sell them to treat heart failure and water retention.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do they not have the same effect as the progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They cure heart failure and such, but they have their own side effects. Using any of the natural steroids derived from pregnenolone—either progesterone or DHEA—will help with water retention, edema, and heart failure.

**Andrew Murray:** And that's because they're antagonizing the effects of aldosterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Aldosterone increases inflammation and leads to fibrosis. Prolonged heart failure, vascular disease, kidney disease, and lung disease all tend to end up with fibrosis. 60 or 70 years ago, a researcher named Lipschutz called pregnenolone and progesterone the "anti-fibromatogenic steroids." They start out inhibiting fibrous overproduction and end up protecting against tumors.

## Caller: High Calcium Levels and Sarcoidosis

**Caller (Rico):** About nine months ago, I was at ICU because my calcium went crazy. I was later diagnosed with sarcoidosis, and my doctor wants me to get down on my calcium level. He's got me on 15 milligrams of prednisone to keep my calcium level down.

**Andrew Murray:** The prednisone is an anti-inflammatory steroid. Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory condition.

**Caller (Rico):** I think he's using prednisone to keep the calcium levels down. But the way you talk sounds like calcium levels are a pretty good idea.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, calcium not in the blood, but in the bones, which is where the calcium should be. Consuming adequate dietary calcium—in the form of powdered eggshells or consuming dairy—getting about 2,000 milligrams of calcium a day will actually let you store the calcium in your bones and prevent it from being in your bloodstream. When you said your blood levels were high, that's because your bones were allowing the calcium to leak out into your blood supply.

**Caller (Rico):** Okay, that does help.

**Andrew Murray:** That would also cause what Dr. Peat was talking about with calcium in the endothelial tissue, making it less elastic. Your body, through parathyroid hormone, starts to pull out calcium from the bone when dietary intake is low.

**Caller (Rico):** Yeah, we want to do the reverse.

**Andrew Murray:** Exactly. Making sure you have a high enough dietary intake of calcium will be the key.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What we've seen with our clients is when people have high calcium in their blood, it's because they're not getting enough in their diet. When they start supplementing their diet with a higher calcium level—closer to 2,000 milligrams—you'll see the blood calcium level come down to a normal range.

**Andrew Murray:** The other thing you should do in conjunction with that is supplement with Vitamin D. The calcium and Vitamin D work synergistically.

**Caller (Rico):** I had a reverse opinion. I thought less was best.

**Andrew Murray:** No, you want to bring your blood levels down by making sure you put it back to the bone.

## Caller: Chickenpox Advice

**Caller (Michael):** I got chickenpox, which is going around. I was wondering what your recommendation would be. I learned from you guys that coconut fat is antiviral, so I'm using that as a salve on my sores and drinking coconut milk.

**Andrew Murray:** From a point of view of anti-infectives, being a viral situation, I don't know how much can be done that quickly. Your own body will certainly get on top of it. When the vesicles burst, they will become quite itchy. Calamine lotion is a fairly good, soothing, calming topical application.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin has been found to have a mild antiviral effect against several types of virus. Someone with AIDS sent me an old publication showing they had begun a trial of aspirin for HIV-infected people and were getting good results. It has been proven somewhat effective for several different kinds of virus, including the herpes/chickenpox type.

## Caller: Buteyko Breathing and CO2

**Caller:** I have been studying the Buteyko method, which is an exercise which will actually increase the CO2 levels. It helps with things like insomnia. I didn't quite get the full picture of what raising those CO2 levels impacts.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat has talked extensively about the benefits of CO2. Most of us associate CO2 as a poisonous gas we need to exhale, when actually oxygen itself is probably more poisonous than CO2. CO2 is very anti-inflammatory and associated with longevity. Peoples and cultures that live at high altitudes have much less inflammatory disease and cancer incidence because of the beneficial effects of CO2.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Bag breathing is another way that you can help to lower blood pressure because it helps with that CO2 and putting calcium in the right place.

## Caller: Athletes and Salt

**Caller (Athlete):** I'm curious how this pertains to athletes. I always have to calculate sweat loss to calculate how much I need to intake. I practice running and cycling sports. How do I calculate how much salt intake I should be taking?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There's been a study done with baking soda showing that athletes performed better when they took up to a tablespoon of baking soda in one day. That's because it increases their CO2. As an athlete, you're blowing off a lot of CO2 when you're exercising.

**Caller (Athlete):** So in reference to CO2, am I actually looking to put my body in a slightly more hypoxic state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In effect, the carbon dioxide is pulling more oxygen through your cell system. It activates the electron transport chain to use oxygen more quickly and effectively. They've done it with endurance races, giving them a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of the race.

You would think that it would make them more alkaline. Alkaline is not necessarily a good state. The carbon dioxide actually enters the cell and becomes an acidic form. Bicarbonate momentarily makes your blood more alkaline, but the absorbed carbon dioxide becomes acidic inside the cell. The intracellular state should be slightly on the acid side when the oxygen is really working. They call it "oxygen" because it means "acid former," and the acid that it makes is carbon dioxide.

In that slightly acidic state, oxygen is having its full action for producing energy. It's that same energy production which takes the calcium out of the cell and lets the cell relax and recuperate properly. If you aren't producing or retaining enough carbon dioxide, the cell will begin making lactic acid. The lactic acid leaves the cell in an alkaline, stressed condition. Even though it's acidifying the blood, it's leaving the cell in a stressed alkaline condition that causes inflammation. So too much aerobic exercise becomes catabolic and inflammatory.

## Caller: Calcium/Magnesium Ratio

**Caller:** I'd like to know about the ratio of calcium and magnesium that Dr. Peat might recommend.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ratio isn't as big an issue as a lot of books say. If you're getting a little excess sodium and calcium, it spares the magnesium. The sodium and calcium activate cell respiration, and cell respiration is needed for cells to retain magnesium. So if you're living low in sodium and calcium, you depend on a good thyroid function to retain magnesium. Any stress that increases aldosterone is going to make you lose magnesium. Keeping your aldosterone and inflammation down, and your thyroid, calcium, and sodium up, is going to make you retain magnesium much more efficiently.

## Conclusion

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding the earlier caller with high calcium: If you're having blood tests, it's good to have your Vitamin D3 in the upper part of the normal range. It would also be good to have the parathyroid hormone (PTH) checked. When you're getting enough Vitamin D and calcium, you will inhibit the parathyroid hormone. Although PTH has its place, you don't want it to be chronically elevated because it is a cancer promoter.
