## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a Master's degree in Herbal Medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture certified organic herbal extracts.

We are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat. He has a new topic of research that he's been working on, so we're lucky to have his take on what is a common misconception about neurotransmitters. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** For those tuning in who haven't heard you before, would you mind sharing your technical background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Between 1968 and 1972, I studied biology at the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology, especially reproductive aging and related biochemistry.

## Body Temperature and the "Set Point"

**Andrew Murray:** The subject I wanted to ask you about this evening—especially for female listeners—is hot flashes in menopause, as well as night sweats not related to menopause. You’ve mentioned a "set point" of body temperature and how that can be aberrantly set, resulting in sweating. Could you describe this set point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In mammals, temperature is regulated by hormones and nerves, partly by causing vasoconstriction or vasodilation in the skin and sweating. When you want to lower your temperature, you sweat and turn pink. This gets blood to the surface where it can release heat into the environment by convection, conduction, and radiation.

Cold-blooded animals, like lizards, move into the sun or exercise when they need to increase their temperature. To treat an infection, a reptile will sit in the sun and let its temperature produce the fever needed to activate the immune system. Humans produce a fever by tightening up the blood vessels in the skin and reducing sweating. When we are producing a fever, we experience a chill.

Reptiles probably feel chilly when they have an infection, so they move into the sunlight to feel warm. They don't feel comfortable until they have a fever. When a person experiences chills, their temperature is rising. They produce goosebumps, making the hairs stand up, and the skin gets pale as circulation is cut off. Inside the body, the adrenaline system activates energy metabolism—burning sugar or fat faster—producing heat while losing it more slowly.

The opposite happens to lower your temperature; you experience a heat surge. People very often confuse the sensation with the actual temperature. Many people think they are getting hotter when they experience a hot flush, but if you measure the core temperature, it typically drops by close to one degree Fahrenheit in the minutes surrounding a hot flush.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when someone has an infection and is alternating chills with sweating, their body is trying to raise the temperature to fight the infection? They are actually getting warmer when they feel cold, and colder when they feel hot?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The sensation you experience is closely related to the thermostat set point. No one knows exactly how that thermostat works, but the physical basis seems to be the protein-water-fat system in the cell. As the temperature rises, it needs to change its chemistry to maintain steadiness. To increase the set point, you stabilize this cytoplasmic system so that it becomes liquid at a higher temperature. It is equivalent to a mechanical thermostat.

**Andrew Murray:** How quickly is it possible to achieve this set point regulation throughout the organism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you administer estrogen to a person or an animal, the reaction is very quick—within minutes to an hour. When estrogen gets into the cells, they are excited by it. To offset that excitation, the temperature has to decrease. Apparently, the sensation of being exposed to estrogen is one of warmth, and that sensation is what lowers our set point.

## Estrogen, Progesterone, and Menopause

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In menopause, when women experience hot flashes, is it due to increased estrogen and a deficiency of progesterone causing them to feel hot, while their actual body temperature is dropping?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. All the symptoms of menopause, including the hot sweat, set in when progesterone fails to be produced. The estrogen levels in the serum are pretty much the same in women with and without hot flashes. It's the absence of the anti-estrogens—progesterone and androgens—that causes the symptoms and hot flushes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why are we told by the medical community that it's a deficiency of estrogen and that we need to take estrogen replacement, when in fact it's a deficiency of progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** More people are realizing the evidence is clearly on the side of progesterone deficiency, but this started back in the 1930s. Drug companies wanted to sell a synthetic estrogen product—first DES, then synthetic estradiol. To sell those products successfully, they had to create an ideology.

Progesterone was known to be the main ovarian hormone. Already in the 1930s, they saw that estrogen was an anti-fertility, abortion-producing hormone, whereas progesterone was the real female hormone that made pregnancy possible. To market the product, they created an ideology calling estrogen the "female hormone." They claimed the ovaries fail and run out of eggs, causing a loss of estrogen and "femaleness." They claimed replacing estrogen would maintain pregnancy and prevent aging. It was an advertising campaign, but many doctors fell for it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And millions of women suffered with deformed babies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The drug companies lobbied the FDA to approve it for treating menopause. They created a legal and public relations environment based on the completely false idea that estrogen was the fertility hormone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They stopped the Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) trials because women were having strokes and heart attacks, but now doctors are prescribing HRT again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of those events—heart attacks, strokes, dementia, breast cancer—were known on the basis of animal studies going back 50 years, and even human studies. The government finally did such a big study that no one could deny it. But in the last 10 years, they have been running campaigns to reverse the effects of the Women's Health Initiative study.

## Serotonin, Stress, and Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss the relationship between serotonin, temperature regulation, and the misconception that serotonin, melatonin, or 5-HTP are good for you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fifty years ago, a similar thing happened with the drug industry regarding serotonin. Carcinoid, an intestinal tumor that produces serotonin, was being studied just when serotonin was discovered to be a brain hormone (though it is mostly an intestinal hormone). The drug industry wanted to create the idea that serotonin was the "hormone of bliss."

However, the carcinoid study identified it as a stress-related hormone that caused flushing. One of the basic signs of that intestinal disease was frequent flushing and psychiatric symptoms. Serotonin activates stress hormones, specifically the cortisol system, and activates aromatase, the enzyme that makes estrogen. Estrogen, in turn, releases and activates the production of serotonin. It becomes a vicious circle of stress, flushing, and tissue breakdown.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Cortisol is a backup mechanism for survival when normal healthy metabolism fails.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's where sugar metabolism comes in. Estrogen's basic effect is to shift metabolism away from sugar to burning fat as a defense mechanism against starvation. Starvation turns on flushing. If you're starving, you don't want to consume your body tissues by converting protein to glucose, so under stress, you turn metabolism toward oxidizing fat. At the same time, you turn off your thyroid, which is responsible for oxidizing sugar efficiently.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Some listeners might think burning fat is a good thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It slows your metabolism and puts the animal into torpor or hibernation. When an animal prepares to hibernate, it stocks its tissues with polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). They found they can induce torpor by feeding animals PUFA. If you give them sugar rather than unsaturated fats, you can keep them from going into torpor.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You were telling us about flamingos in Africa living in hot climates.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Leslie Brown, a specialist in flamingos, suspected they could live to be 130 years old. They wade in hot, salty water eating algae. At that high temperature, the algae couldn't live if it made polyunsaturated fats because they would oxidize immediately. So, the algae makes saturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Whereas cold-water fish need polyunsaturated fat to keep their fat liquid at cold temperatures. But you mentioned fish in the Amazon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They analyzed the fat in Amazon fish, where the water is very warm—75 to 85 degrees. Their fat is similar to butter, about 97% saturated.

## Caller: Night Sweats in Men

**Caller:** I have a male friend who gets anxiety attacks and night sweats, mostly right before he wakes up in the morning. How does that relate to hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a man is under severe stress—infection, trauma, or starvation—his estrogen multiplies and can become equivalent to a woman's estrogen levels. Stress causes you to waste stored glucose, leading to fluctuating episodes of hypoglycemia. This triggers the release of cortisol to break down tissue into sugar.

Cortisol is usually highest around dawn. If you are stressed, cortisol and estrogen can go extremely high, bringing blood sugar up. This rise in blood sugar lowers the adrenaline system, allowing the skin to produce sweat and become hot. The sweating and sense of heat go with very high cortisol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if he woke up around 2:00 or 3:00 AM and had a glass of orange juice with a little salt, that might help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I've known people who had nightmares every hour during the night. By waking up and having orange juice or milk, they could lengthen the time between nightmares. In a week or so, you can get your liver stocked up with enough glucose to sleep through the night.

**Andrew Murray:** It’s a failure of glucose storage. If people consume enough fruit sugars (fructose), the glycogen stores in the liver get replenished, enabling them to get through the night without using adrenaline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the last few years, studies have shown that menopausal hot flashes can be prevented with sugar. A big dose of carbohydrate at bedtime works better than estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That’s because it replenishes the liver so it doesn't have to rely on stress hormones.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen does have some effect in reducing hot flashes, but it is an unphysiological effect. Estrogen lowers the metabolism, potentially putting a person close to a hibernation state where they don't have the metabolic surges that cause the flush. Also, high doses of estrogen block the sweating mechanism.

## Caller: Steroids and Hormones in Sports

**Caller:** I have a question about athletes, specifically regarding "Melky" Cabrera. Athletes sometimes take female hormones to mask the fact that they have been taking steroids. What does that do to their cortisol and bodies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone will cover up and protect against many of the toxic steroids. Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against several toxic steroids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why would athletes take steroids if they take progesterone to mask it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure what specific hormone they were taking, but progesterone generally protects against toxic effects.

## Caller: Statins and Cholesterol

**Caller:** What do I tell my doctor when they want to put me on statins for high cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tell him not to. Statins don't just inhibit cholesterol; they inhibit a whole system of related chemicals in the body, impair energy production, and carry risks of muscle damage and toxic effects on the brain and liver.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Tell them you'd like to try a thyroid supplement first.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Thyroid function and cholesterol are mirror images. In the 1930s, they knew that removing the thyroid caused an immediate rise in cholesterol. Giving a thyroid supplement caused an immediate decrease. I've seen people with cholesterol of 450 or 500 drop to normal in a week with fast-acting thyroid supplementation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And avoid pork, chicken, and turkey fat. Grass-fed beef and lamb are better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, polyunsaturated fat blocks the thyroid at all levels of function.

## Bisphenol A (BPA)

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Could you comment on Bisphenol A (BPA) in plastics and its estrogen-mimicking characteristics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is disastrous early in life. Prenatal or infancy exposure shapes the whole development of the organism. An adult is less sensitive, but it is still very toxic as a strong estrogen, leading to degenerative inflammatory effects. It crosses the placental barrier.

## Caller: Diet vs. Statins

**Caller:** I had a similar experience with my doctor wanting to prescribe statins. I asked for time to try natural methods. I stayed away from greasy, fatty foods, salt, and sugar, and did load-bearing exercise. In three weeks, I turned it around.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think the biggest change was avoiding greasy foods, which in America are usually fried in toxic polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. The polyunsaturated fat blocks the thyroid. By removing that block, the thyroid function goes up, and cholesterol goes down.

## Night Sweats and Intestinal Health

**Andrew Murray:** Let's go back to night sweats. I was taught they were indicative of disease. How does that fit your view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body needs to cool off to permit sleep. You have to shift from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system. Parasympathetic activation makes you sweat. Just lying down shifts you toward parasympathetic dominance. However, prolonged darkness increases cortisol production.

One thing that happens at night is the slowing of the digestive process, which can allow bacteria to become more toxin-producing. Keeping your intestine clean—for example, eating a raw grated carrot in the afternoon—stimulates the intestine and suppresses bacterial growth, reducing the stress load.

## Caller: Meat Fat Quality

**Caller:** Regarding beef, is there a difference in the fat between commercial and grass-fed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Grass-fed is ideal. Grass has a high content of Vitamin E. Vitamin E is used by the animal to destroy polyunsaturated fats. The more Vitamin E in the diet, the lower the polyunsaturated fat content of the beef.

**Caller:** I notice grass-fed beef sometimes looks fattier.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat that is most important. Grain-fed beef has less Vitamin E, which allows the unsaturated oils to survive the rumen and get into the tissues. Normal beef is about 98% saturated. It is the high percentage of polyunsaturated fat in grain-fed animals that is the danger.

## Summary and Recommendations

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To wrap up, what can we recommend to decrease hot flashes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carbohydrates in general, but especially fruit. Gelatin is the best protein because it doesn't make serotonin. Salty foods help stabilize blood sugar and lower stress systems.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There are also herbs. Nettle root blocks the aromatase enzyme. Vitex blocks prolactin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin and caffeine are also useful. Aspirin blocks aromatase, and caffeine stimulates progesterone production.

**Andrew Murray:** And Lobelia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, nicotine patches are even being studied because they lower aromatase and estrogen. Lobelia contains lobeline, which occupies the nicotinic receptor and can have a similar protective effect.
