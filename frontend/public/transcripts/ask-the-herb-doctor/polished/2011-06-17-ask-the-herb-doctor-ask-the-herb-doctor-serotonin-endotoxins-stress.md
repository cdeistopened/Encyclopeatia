# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Endotoxin, Stress, and Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts.

You're listening to KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. You are all invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's topic: a mixed topic of endotoxin, stress, and depression, and how the body is affected physiologically. We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show this evening. Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** For people who have just tuned in, would you let them know your specific interests and your professional academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology at the University of Oregon. My dissertation was on the aging of the oxidative processes in relation to reproduction, and how hormones change with aging and affect the efficiency of oxidative metabolism. The main hormones that I've studied over the years have related directly to estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid, and the nutritional and environmental factors that influence those. I also study how all of the minor hormones and signaling substances in the body are interrelated between the environment, those hormones, and respiratory energy production.

## The Politics of Nutrition and Science

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I know that you have a rather unique view of physiology and biology which is different from the regular scientific community. The way they've done their research, or how it has been funded, has led them to be inaccurate in their perceptions of how biological systems operate. I think we want to reiterate some of the problems associated with the modern diet and how we've been misled.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since about the Second World War, biology has been heavily influenced by several factors. The agricultural industry is interested in promoting certain ideas toward foods. The pharmaceutical industry is promoting a very mechanical, reductionist interpretation of health based on the idea of receptors and genetic interaction with specific hormones and drugs. And then there's the government and military orientation that has its commitment to certain kinds of psychology and science, promoting a reductionist, anti-holistic, anti-pattern-oriented kind of science.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's why our USDA recommended daily intake of refined carbohydrates—breads and pastas—was six to seven servings per day at the bottom of the pyramid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can see that they are actually having their effect. In the last 35 years, the consumption of flour and cereals has increased by 30%, just as the Agriculture Department put in their triangle.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It should be a fat bottom on the triangle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In these last 35 years, while cereals are up 30% and fats are up 7%, meat, eggs, and dairy have decreased 13%, and added sugar has even decreased 1%. Where many people think that nutrition research should be exploratory—looking for new ways that foods interact with biological possibilities—the financing is heavily weighted towards industrial food products as nutrients, rather than exploring, for example, the thousands of fruits and vegetables that grow in the tropics.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. Well, our country doesn't grow those, so therefore we shouldn't eat them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happened with the coconut oil industry. It was used widely in products like Oreo cookies and fried foods from about the 1850s on. When the soy oil industry got tired of competition, they put out tremendous propaganda starting 20 years ago, saying that the tropical oils were poisonous. What they did was increase the consumption of their unsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And now heart disease, high cholesterol, obesity, cancer, dementia, and diabetes have all been on the increase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And these are known to be increased by unsaturated fats, cereals, and starches—exactly the things the government has promoted.

## The Truth About Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to serotonin, most people mistakenly think that serotonin is good for you. People ask us about serotonin for sleep and other benefits. What is the truth behind serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An example of how confused the promotion has been is that one of the major antidepressants is called a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) that supposedly acts by increasing serotonin. They knew that it was an effective treatment for vicious dogs, and they said that's because it increases their serotonin. But people studying the dogs after a month of treatment with this SSRI found that, in fact, they were less vicious and their serotonin had gone *down* significantly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it didn't increase their serotonin, it actually decreased it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the antidepressants that work are actually, in the long run, shifting the balance away from serotonin. Over the last 40 years, there have been many papers published showing that LSD counteracted the effects of serotonin on smooth muscle. Finally, they showed an antagonistic effect where it inhibits the serotonin nerves in the brain. Every place that they checked its function as an antidote to serotonin, it was opposing serotonin and improving functions such as learning ability, physical symptoms, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory effects.

But because of the government campaign against LSD-type drugs, the drug companies came out with modified forms of lysergic acid—such as bromocriptine and lisuride—and some anti-serotonin drugs that were known to lower serotonin. However, they advertised them as pro-dopamine drugs rather than anti-serotonin, or as antihistamines. They took advantage of the government campaign against the anti-serotonin drugs to say that psychedelic drugs made people insane, and started promoting the idea that their drugs would make people sane and happy by *increasing* serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned that serotonin is primarily produced in the bowel.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's a defensive chemical everywhere. It's one of the primitive protective reactions. For example, in the bowel, it causes spasms that clean out the bowel when you eat something poisonous, causing diarrhea. That is protective. But if it keeps up too long, it increases the serotonin. 95% of it is produced in the bowel and only a small percentage in other organs such as the brain.

If the irritation of the bowel keeps up very long, the circulation in the bloodstream becomes a problem systemically. It will cause vascular spasms, vascular leakiness, and inflammation. For example, when you have prolonged irritation of the intestine, tumors begin to promote serotonin release. The lower part of the bowel is where it's most likely to be overproduced. That systemic effect hits the right side of the heart primarily. The reason it is worse for the right side of the heart is that the lungs have the enzymes that destroy serotonin. The platelets pick it up from the intestine and carry it to the lungs, where, if they're working, they can destroy most of the serotonin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What symptoms would somebody experience if they have elevated serotonin leaking from their intestines and acting on the right side of the heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fibrous deterioration of the valves on the right side of the heart, and ultimately pulmonary artery hypertension. Surprisingly, the lung has some processes that seem the opposite of what we usually think of for antioxidants. Peroxide formed in the lungs helps to destroy the serotonin. That seems to be how negatively ionized air helps to relieve asthma and improve mood—because it helps to destroy serotonin in the lungs.

**Andrew Murray:** So pulmonary artery hypertension is one of the side effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's where it got its name—from "toning" up the circulatory system.

**Andrew Murray:** If a client had asthma and constipation or diarrhea, are there any other pulmonary changes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The best established are asthma symptoms and pulmonary artery hypertension, but I think probably emphysema as well. You get thickening of the diffusion pathway between the lung sacs and the capillaries. Lactic acid and serotonin are closely connected; one increases the other. It's known that high lactic acid from too much exercise causes many athletes to chronically have an increased pathway for diffusion, so their blood leaves the lungs less perfectly oxygenated than a person with lower serotonin and lactate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** With asthmatics, it's very common that if they remove the food they're allergic to or that's irritating their intestine, their asthma goes away.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the direct effect of the serotonin on the contraction of the smooth muscles in the bronchial tubes.

## Bowel Inflammation and Fiber

**Andrew Murray:** In the old days, from Culpeper back to Greece, the administration of purgatives to unstop people with constipation was looked at as prime importance in treating inflammatory disorders. Inflammation of the bowel used to be recorded frequently as a cause of death in older people, but it's seldom referred to now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I worked in the hamster lab, we saw that the old animals practically always had a bowel inflammation when they seemed to be dying of old age. I looked up 19th-century cases, and it was a very popular diagnosis of death at that time.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Over 50% of the herbs traditionally used are laxatives, purgatives, or cholagogues.

**Andrew Murray:** How important do you see bowel health to general systemic health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably it's the central thing that everyone should think about more. The connection can be traced directly to Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, liver disease, heart disease, and arthritis. They've known for many years that various types of arthritis are alleviated by prolonged fasting because of relief of the inflammation in the intestine.

However, laxatives and purgatives are the more practical, ongoing way to prevent that chronic inflammation. Starches and indigestible fibers have been tested on various animals. Practically all of the fibers used as food additives—carrageenan, guar gum, oat bran, and even psyllium—have been identified as carcinogens for the intestine and possibly other organs. Getting those out quickly before they support bacterial growth and ferment is crucial. The fermenting bacteria are known to increase serotonin, lactic acid production, and endotoxin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Endotoxin is something that bacteria produce in response to digesting these indigestible, fermentable starches.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and there's a back-and-forth increase of endotoxin by the serotonin and vice versa. All of these increase other factors such as carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is another short-term primitive defensive system, but in the long range, it is closely associated with Alzheimer's, cancer, and brain injury. It activates the conversion of polyunsaturated fats to inflammatory prostaglandins. It becomes a vicious circle of starch, serotonin, and endotoxin.

**Andrew Murray:** What is your take on dietary fiber?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The two that I have run across in the literature and experimentation are raw carrots and cooked bamboo shoots.

**Andrew Murray:** And these don't support bad bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are antiseptic or antibiotic in themselves. You can store them for a surprisingly long time, whereas other vegetables tend to rot. Carrots are used to living in moist soil, so they can kill fungus and bacteria.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** With hand towels, they make these bamboo fiber towels. A cotton towel smells after one day, but bamboo towels don't tend to smell as bad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's partly that their cellulose is very resistant to bacterial breakdown, but it also doesn't have pectin. Pectin supports bad bacterial growth and fermentation. The so-called soluble fibers in beans and other legumes support bacterial growth and toxin production.

**Andrew Murray:** Why has the industry been so keen to push dietary fiber?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fibers like acacia and guar gum are very convenient for food processing. Carrageenan is now widely used; they can increase the weight of meat by as much as 30% by injecting this water-retaining gum. It's used instead of cream for making ice cream so that it has a long shelf life. It's just a matter of cheapness.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Traditionally we would have eaten potatoes, and South Americans ate a lot of masa which has been partially digested. How should we cope with starches?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dennis Burkitt started the fiber fad about 30 years ago when he discovered that Africans didn't have a high incidence of bowel and liver cancer and had three bowel movements per day. He thought fiber prevented the retention of toxins. But he was talking primarily about potatoes. When he came to the US, people interpreted it as oat fiber and grain fibers. Research outside the US showed that those actually *increase* cancer incidence.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if someone were to eat root vegetables and boil them very well, this helps break down the starch. Saturated fats like coconut oil and butter help inhibit the growth of bacteria.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It happens that phosphate, which you get in grains, seeds, and nuts, stimulates the breakdown of these fibers by bacteria. Calcium blocks that phospholysis of the fibers. So a high calcium, low phosphate diet goes with saturated fats in suppressing the toxic effects of starches.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about fermenting grains, like traditional sourdough bread?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That digests it. The longer it digests, the more it turns into a sprout. A sprout is basically a little sugar, protein, and water, whereas the starch is mostly indigestible proteins and starches with a high phosphate content.

## Calcium and Vitamin D

**Andrew Murray:** I read an article by a doctor who was putting down the need for calcium and reducing the need for Vitamin D to only 400-600 IU. I know you've mentioned 2,000 to 4,000 IU. This doctor was talking about the problems of calcification.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors consistently get it wrong. They think mechanically that if you eat more calcium, you're going to calcify your kidneys and arteries. It's been known for 60 years that when you are low in calcium, Vitamin D, or Vitamin K, your parathyroid hormone increases. It takes calcium out of the bones to balance the phosphate and puts it into the arteries and kidneys. The surest way to guarantee calcification of your brain, heart, arteries, and kidneys is to have a high phosphate, low calcium, low Vitamin K and Vitamin D diet.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Perhaps that study was funded by the producers of Fosamax, because they know if people aren't getting adequate calcium and Vitamin D, they will have more bone disease.

**Andrew Murray:** And some of the biggest sources of dietary phosphorus are legumes, beans, and peas.

## Caller Questions: Alcohol, Lectins, and Stress

**Caller 1:** I was always under the impression that serotonin was mainly a brain chemical. Since you mentioned its effect on the digestive system, I'm wondering what the interaction of melatonin would be in comparison to serotonin? Also, is alcohol considered an endotoxin? I've heard people can get intoxicated from alcohol created within the gut.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person has very sluggish digestion, yeast can grow so freely that the overgrowth turns sugars into alcohol. Some people stay drunk all the time when they have yeast living in the upper part of the intestine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would those people feel drunk more quickly if they drank alcohol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. That tends to increase carbon monoxide. That's the toxic part of it. The alcohol itself in small amounts might make them mildly drunk, but the harm is that carbon monoxide is increased by the alcohol. Carbon monoxide blocks oxidative metabolism and releases iron, which deposits in the brain, liver, and arteries with a toxic effect.

**Andrew Murray:** How about the connection between serotonin and melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pineal gland converts serotonin to melatonin, activated by adrenaline during stress. It has opposite effects from serotonin. I think of it as a detoxifying system against serotonin. People studying rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, and breast cancer see the enzyme that converts serotonin into melatonin. It's probably defensive against the inflammatory and carcinogenic effects of serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** Would it be useful to supplement with melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it has anti-inflammatory effects, but it's much better to work at the other end—making it unnecessary by reducing your tryptophan intake and reducing starches and inflammation-producing things.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had a caller earlier mention swing sets for adults as a health tip for stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you get your stomach in knots from fear or stress, serotonin is being released. It causes stress ulcers. Immobilized rats experimentally will quickly get intestinal bleeding. If they are allowed to defend themselves—like biting on a stick—they can block that stress reaction and lower the serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** That's a good illustration of the ability to defend yourself.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think of that as analogous to concentric muscle exercise, where you are shortening the muscles under force. Eccentric exercise, like walking downhill, stretches the muscles and makes them sore. Old people with damaged mitochondria can repair them with concentric exercises. I think the same sort of thing happens in the nervous system when you can do something protective or constructive.

**Caller 2:** I'm an old farmer. The wheat grown now by big agribusiness has almost 90% more gluten, which is a lectin. Lectins are sticky proteins that protect the plant seed from invaders. When they get in your body, they attack sugar molecules in your cells. I'm taking a supplement with "sacrificial sugars" that attach to the lectins so my cellular sugars are protected.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are many defensive chemicals. Bananas are extremely allergenic, probably because of intensive production in poor soils. Even polyunsaturated fats in seeds have a specific effect against digestive enzymes and add to the absorption of lectins. Ordinary sugars—sucrose, for example—have a tremendously protective effect in resisting all of these inflammation-producing factors. Fructose catalyzes the ability to use glucose efficiently. So sucrose is better than even well-cooked starch at protecting the immune system from these irritants.

## Stress and "Adaptive Energy"

**Andrew Murray:** Let's pick up on stress. People always talk about stress being bad for you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only mistake Hans Selye made in his work on stress was talking about a limited ability to adapt because we are born with a certain amount of "adaptive energy." I don't think there is such a thing. I think it's substances like sucrose and fructose which let us deal with menacing things like serotonin and endotoxin.

What Selye called a lack of adaptive energy, I think is actually us adapting to a bad environment. We get worse as we adapt to bad things like polyunsaturated fats and chronic excess serotonin. Serotonin increases collagen production, leading to fibrosis of blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and brain. Too much adaptation to a bad environment is what causes aging and degeneration.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the immediate response of serotonin—like diarrhea—is a short-term help, but constant exposure causes degenerative disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A high calcium diet and plenty of sugar will keep your thyroid working and keep your carbon dioxide up. Carbon dioxide keeps the serotonin bound and out of trouble. When you're stressed and make lactic acid, that displaces the carbon dioxide and activates the release of serotonin.

**Caller 3:** My first depression hit in 1964. They put me on Elavil, which didn't do a thing. This happened after I took some potent LSD. I went through "gas treatments" where they started with nitrous oxide and then switched to a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide. It would kick off the medulla thinking you're suffocating and you would hyperventilate. It was a trip to hell.

**Andrew Murray:** We are going to have to leave it there, I'm afraid, as we are out of time. Dr. Peat, thank you very much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
