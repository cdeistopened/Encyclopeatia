## Introduction to Holistic vs. Mechanistic Medicine

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. It's March 18, 2022. You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD. Callers are invited to call in with questions related to this month's continuing topic of mTOR and a further discussion of holistic versus mechanistic approaches to the treatment of disease. Without further ado, let's introduce Dr. Raymond Peat, who once again is joining us. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, thank you as always for giving your time. I'm constantly reminded that some people just don't know that there are alternatives to the standard model, whether it's treatment, chemicals, or whatever it is. For those people who are listening now and who will pick this up on the audio archives, would you just give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology in graduate school, I was studying linguistics, literature, and psychology and teaching in those areas. I decided I needed a more technical science background to understand how the brain works in the humanities and language. So in 1968, I went to graduate school at the University of Oregon in biology and finished my dissertation in 1972 in the area of reproductive physiological aging—the changes of oxidative metabolism during aging and its effect on reproduction. I've been applying insights and related things to all sorts of problems in the 50 years since then.

**Andrew Murray:** All right, thank you for that. For those of you who are listening, we take callers from now until the end of the show at 8:00. The number is 707-923-3911.

Dr. Peat, I wanted to carry on last month's topic of the findings around mTOR, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, and its use in cancer. The bulk of the evening's show will remain based on alternative approaches to cancer. We like to give the scientific background for the relevance of certain substances, whether natural or synthetic, as a better approach to the treatment of disease.

Would you give an outline of how alternatives have been usurped by the modern approach to disease, and how the machinery which drives that research is corrupted by financial interests? We really haven't made hardly any significant increases in our knowledge of the treatment of cancer in particular. Could you describe how the thinking of classical biologists, like Szent-Györgyi and numerous others, has changed and what we are currently faced with in medicine, which doesn't seek to treat people holistically, let alone scientifically in some cases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mechanistic materialist view reduces everything to a cause-and-effect relation between two simple bits of matter. That makes everything seem absolutely clear to the people who have defined science that way. But when you focus on the interaction of just a few particles, you can understand those very clearly, but you miss the whole context. People like Warburg and Szent-Györgyi looked at the whole picture of biology. Warburg saw things that happened in yeast and saw them happening in cancer: the production of lactic acid, even in the presence of oxygen. He had the insight that this is something very important about the nature of life.

Szent-Györgyi was following up on insights by other people, such as W.F. Koch, and worked out the classical view of how oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism work. But he kept in mind the whole organism and what's going on at every level of water and energy supply interactions. He didn't focus on a few reductionistic material interactions that ordinary science does. As a result, Warburg's work was ridiculed and ignored for more than 50 years. It was only around the beginning of this century that things he did in the 1920s started to be appreciated, but they were generally misunderstood.

Szent-Györgyi's work on cancer involved things that biologists and doctors had never heard of, or even could think of—the idea of what electrons in water are doing and how motion is the essential feature of life, powered by the organized flow of electrons. He applied that to cancer as well as muscle function and circulation. Every aspect of biology can be re-understood in terms of very simple things that act everywhere. The really scientific work, attempting to understand the organism in terms of everything that can be known about it, is something the mainline science people are blind to because it doesn't at all fit into reductionistic or mechanistic materialism.

## The Cancer Field and Bystander Effect

**Andrew Murray:** The concept of looking for a cause and an effect, driving that mechanistic approach, largely ignores the concept of a living organism interacting with and being affected directly by its environment. In your newsletter, you mentioned the presence and the absolute knowledge of the cancer field, not as a theory but as a reality.

For people listening, the concept of the bystander effect exists. If a cell is irradiated outside of the body and is introduced into the body, it can have a similarly damaging effect, not because it's releasing high-energy electrons, but because the stress signals that the cell gives out as a result of being irradiated have a direct effect on other cells it comes into contact with, either directly or at a distance. That is a reality. It's almost like a quantum physical event that we can only begin to imagine with the last 10 or 15 years of science opening up to quantum theory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People were demonstrating the phenomenon 60 years ago. They knew that if you X-ray an animal, you didn't have to X-ray the brain and pituitary to cause generalized hormonal changes. For example, if you irradiated a female's foot, it would cause the animal to go into heat. The whole organism would shift its hormonal balance towards reproductive heat. That is an example of the whole body as a cancer field. The signal from the radiation is a holistic stress on the whole organism that spreads something that promotes cancer.

The mainstream biologists and medical people are still insisting that radiation causes spot damage to the DNA, causing a mutation in one gene, and that that mechanistic one-to-one damage somehow works its way out, ending up as a cancer. But that simply isn't a realistic picture. The radiation doesn't have to hit the DNA; it does something excitatory and pro-inflammatory to the organism, separate from anything it might do to the DNA. That general stress reaction to radiation turns on signals that transmit estrogen-like signals all through the body. People have found out that you can treat radiation poisoning and estrogen poisoning in the same way. And if you add radiation to estrogen, you get an additive effect of the damage.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, this is why you strongly recommend against any form of radiation, but specifically dental X-rays. Because X-rays damage fast-dividing cells, and when you have a dental X-ray, it's affecting your brain, which is very rapidly dividing, your eyes, your thyroid, and your tongue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cancer of the tonsils, eyes, and brain have all increased along with the incidence or intensity of dental X-rays. A study in Seattle several years ago put a lead shield over the abdomen of pregnant women and found that a full set of dental X-rays, with the thyroid and pelvis shielded by lead, caused the babies to be born underweight and underdeveloped if the mother was pregnant at the time—the same way any stress or excess estrogen would do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the stress of that dental X-ray spread all the way down to the uterus and the developing baby.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything in the body.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to briefly get into the term "cancer field" before we get into the subject of mTOR. You wrote in your January newsletter that the cancer field is set up such that the actual tumor itself has differing degrees of damage to the cells in a radiating pattern out from the tumor. Essentially, there's a radiating pattern of damage from the central tumor out to distant, pre-cancerous tissues beyond the tumor, and that is propagated by a direct pathway that is similar to the bystander effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Any of the intense stresses, like oxygen or glucose deficiency, will reduce efficient oxygen metabolism and cause stress signals. When one particular area is responding more intensely to stress, you get a small local version of the organismic bystander effect. The bystander effect refers to things that are well-distributed through the body. But with intense signals, a cell that is approaching or has already turned into cancer will chronically produce an excess of lactic acid, even when it gets oxygen. So there will be a gradient of lactic acid surrounding that cell that irritates and disturbs the nearby cells, which then begin producing lactic acid, and that spreads maybe through a few centimeters of solid tissue.

Just the local diffusion causes a visible gradient, ending up in a gradient of DNA damage and mutations. It's hard to list all of the factors other than lactic acid that are diffusing out of an injured cell. They include carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and a variety of inflammatory cytokines. Everything that the body uses to respond protectively to damage can help local tissues multiply faster to fill in a wound. It accelerates the movement and replication of cells, so it's an essential part of healing. But when it's being originated from a mutated or seriously damaged group of cells, then it's tending to simply spread the damage rather than accelerate healing.

All of these are normal healing factors, like activating the local production of estrogen. That's a normal part of repairing tissue damage. But when it is prolonged and something causes the body to be unable to turn it off, each of these things adds to the spreading effect. As far as it diffuses locally, you'll see this gradient of deterioration, including mutations. Meanwhile, it's adding a burden to the whole organism with the more likely radiation bystander effect.

## The mTOR Pathway in Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD. Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us.

Before we get into the continued dialogue about mTOR and its importance as a target for the treatment of cancer, I wanted to outline this differentiation I started the show with in terms of mechanistic versus holistic approaches. I read an article that discussed the phospho-inositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, and mTOR pathway as a three-branched signaling pathway. It said that approximately 70% of ovarian and breast cancers are activated by a derangement in this pathway, about 90% of lung adenocarcinomas show an aberrant activation of this pathway, and 40% or so of squamous cell carcinomas are activated by this pathway.

Last month, we talked about mTOR for the first time. You had mentioned mTORC1 and mTORC2 as being subsets of mTOR. We discussed the etiology of mTOR, its discovery, and its reference to rapamycin and how that was discovered to be a good novel treatment to block this inflammatory pathway that cancer uses. Would you briefly outline mTORC1 and mTORC2 again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mTORC1 form is an activating, phosphorylating enzyme. When you're normally fed and growing up, it's what mediates between eating more and growing more. If you overeat at any time, you tend to overproduce this growth factor that necessarily leads to degenerative diseases. Excess calorie intake is very important. The activation of a cell will turn on mTOR, synthesis, and growth. Intracellular calcium, which should mostly be outside the cells, is an activating factor inside the cell that increases mTOR.

The mTORC2 form of the enzyme does similar things, but it's fairly insensitive to the usual signals such as overeating. It depends mostly on growth hormone, and many kinds of stress will turn on an excess of growth hormone. Women have spectacularly high levels of growth hormone compared to men as a result of estrogen's stress-inducing effect. That growth hormone has some particular ways of affecting our handling of fat, but that's basically the way mTORC2 is turned on—through high growth hormone.

**Andrew Murray:** And these growth hormones in their own right are proliferative agents that would promote cancer growth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** When I read about this mTOR/PI3K/AKT pathway, it looked like it wasn't just about mTOR, but that these other two arms of the same signaling messenger system were also very good targets for shutting down the energy pathway. I found that a little hard to reconcile, given that thyroid hormone and progesterone are anti-inflammatory and energy-conservative mechanisms. It seemed like turning off energy production was something to be done to have a beneficial effect on slowing cancers down. Perhaps this is the same mechanism by which calorie restriction produces greater longevity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Overeating and mTOR tend to favor the oxidation of fats over glucose. When that happens, you're basically slowing down the constructive part of energy metabolism and shifting over towards some of these risky, simple growth pathways.

## Natural Inhibitors and Holistic Approaches

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about shutting down not just mTOR but these other two linked pathways as a three-branched target? It's not mechanistic in the sense of looking for a cell-killing effect. A lot of the things that were listed were flavonoids, biologically active molecules found in fruits and vegetables, which is what the "five servings of fruit and vegetables a day" recommendation is based on—not just from a vitamin C perspective, but for the antioxidant flavonoids.

I was looking for mTOR inhibitors and saw things like resveratrol from Japanese knotweed and grape skins. Then there are berries like blueberries, bilberries, and cranberries, and citrus fruits contain these flavonoids. I also saw two other herbs that caught my attention. One was a Chinese herb, *Platycodon grandiflorus*, which contains a compound called Platycodin D. Another Chinese herb, *Magnolia grandiflora*, contains a product called honokiol. They were using those as both AKT-blocking and mTOR-inactivating substances.

When people use flavonoids for a systemic inflammatory disorder, these antioxidants can quench the free-radical-generating effect of inflammation. How can this be part of a holistic anti-cancer approach, rather than mechanistically poisoning the cancer cell, which a lot of chemotherapy and radiotherapy does? I know you promote generating higher-than-physiological levels of CO2 as being protective, along with other protective molecules like progesterone and aspirin. What do you think about the flavonoids and other substances I've mentioned?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Energetically, they do directly quench free radicals and are protective that way. But I think a more basic effect is that they intensify the cell's normal cytochrome oxidase-based oxidation by speeding up the energy-producing oxidation through the electron transport chain. That process prevents or reduces the random oxidation that creates free radical damage. So it's a lot more general and fundamental to intensify respiratory energy than to try to use the antioxidant function.

If you think in terms of antioxidants, it can go wrong because cancer is better than anything at creating antioxidant effects. Part of their wildness is their ability to defend themselves against free radical damage. Chemotherapy and radiation are intended to kill cancer cells by way of free radical damage, but they have an antioxidant system that uses high production of electrons. Basically, the excess of lactic acid causes an excess of electrons that will quench the free radicals, but meanwhile, they're failing to activate normal energy-producing oxidation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You were talking earlier that if you got dental X-rays or other X-rays, it affected things near it. If you were going to be exposed to X-rays, what sorts of foods or other things would you want to do to help protect yourself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things such as thyroid, magnesium, and progesterone, which promote the production of carbon dioxide rather than lactic acid. And then all of these other protective things: the flavonoids, caffeine, aspirin, and so on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think what it sounds like you and Andrew are describing is that cancer involves a lot of inflammation, and a lot of these compounds are acting as anti-inflammatories and increasing normal cellular respiration.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's really a secret of thyroid function. It's anti-inflammatory by directing oxygen towards consuming these electrons that would otherwise cause inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because when the body's inflamed, it results in lactic acid respiration, which is very damaging and inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the loose electrons that are susceptible to random oxidation.

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor. The number to call is 707-923-3911.

In terms of using agents that would block mTOR or the PI3K or AKT pathways, I saw that they've come up with second-generation mTOR inhibitors. I think you mentioned the first-generation ones last month: sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus. But they also talked about second-generation inhibitors, calling them ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors, such as Torin 1 and Torin 2. Do you think these molecules that compete with ATP, the energy currency of the cell, have some value? I have trouble conceptualizing interfering with energy production.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That doesn't sound like it will end well.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The essential thing you need is to stabilize the cells.

**Andrew Murray:** Because you're always mentioning sugar being very important and not to starve someone of sugar, not just for diabetes but for cancer. And it's not at all scientifically rationalized that that is a good way to go.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because the starving cancer emits signals that tell the body to convert its own tissues—muscles, skin, nerves—to amino acids which can be turned into glucose. So when you starve a cancer cell, it tells the body to start breaking itself down to provide the food it wants.

**Andrew Murray:** They also went on to discuss cancer metabolism and angiogenesis—the creation of novel vessels to bring blood and nutrients to the cancer. We've mentioned before that the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor was very responsible for driving and promoting cancer, and how things like vascular endothelial growth factor are other substances which drive cancer's production. So blocking the hypoxia-inducible factor is something that I know you've talked about in the past.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That tends to go with activating carbonic anhydrase, which is the cell's way of disposing of acidic carbon dioxide. But when that is too active, it causes the cell to become alkaline, leading to the production of lactic acid. That's very central to cancer metabolism: to create alkalinity inside the cell by activating the enzyme that converts carbon dioxide from its acidic form to the carbonic acid form.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who are listening, I wanted to run through some other natural mTOR inhibitors. I think I mentioned turmeric last month. Turmeric is getting a lot of press for its anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects, and it probably gets its anti-cancer kudos from being a natural mTOR inhibitor. Then resveratrol from *Polygonum cuspidatum*, and a compound whose abbreviation is EGCG, epigallocatechin gallate, from green tea, as well as caffeine. I was pleased to see caffeine, which may inhibit mTOR signaling directly and indirectly.

I saw two other substances that caught my attention. One was a substance called shogaol from ginger root. An article said it inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by directly targeting AKT and AKT2, but not the PI3K or mTOR pathway. So ginger was used there specifically for colon cancer. And I know you're not into the pre-diabetes treating drugs, but metformin was actually listed as one of those things to inhibit mTOR. Do you have any good things to say about metformin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only drawback is that it acts to inhibit part of the electron transport chain, so it's impairing the mitochondria while also doing the beneficial thing of turning off mTOR. So it's good to be cautious about metformin because there's not enough known about it, but still, its effects are generally protective through inhibiting mTOR.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there's much value in using some of these substances as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's? I saw other references for neurodegenerative disorders, and I think there may have been a Parkinson's indication because of the amyloid-beta that was decreased and the neurofibrillary tangles that could be mitigated by using some of these substances because of their effect on mTOR and mTOR's downstream effects on amyloid production.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, inflammation is involved in all of the degenerative processes. And so the anti-inflammatory, anti-mTOR things are turning out to be protective against obesity, Alzheimer's, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus—anything you can think of turns out to involve inflammation at its root.

## Caller: Turmeric Use

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, we do have a caller. The number is 707-923-3911. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Caller:** Hello, Andrew, Sarah, and Dr. Peat. This is Margaret from Garberville. I'm grateful for your show. Your mention of turmeric caught me because I use turmeric daily. I know that there's a tendency in our society to find something like turmeric and say, "Oh, this is so great. I'm going to put it in capsules and take a lot of it every day." I was wondering if you would address whether that's really beneficial, or if it's beneficial enough to take it in your ordinary diet, just as it comes. Do we have to really sock it to our bodies with all of these extracts and pills?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you can overeat on the so-called protective things. Same with vitamin C; instead of being an antioxidant, it becomes pro-oxidant when it begins producing excess electrons itself.

**Caller:** Turmeric comes to mind because I do use that. I know people that take it in little capsules every day, and it seems excessive to me, but I'm not sure. Is it beneficial at that level?

**Andrew Murray:** I think some of this comes from studying populations in countries that use it in their cuisine, like the Indian subcontinent, where they use a lot of turmeric and ginger. I think they have fairly low incidences of colorectal cancer, and they've kind of put two and two together when they've looked at turmeric and its anti-inflammatory activity, positing that as a potential mechanism.

**Caller:** Well, the thing is, they use it as a matter of course in their daily lives. We tend to say, "This is great, I'm going to load myself up with it." I'm just thinking that maybe that's not as beneficial as we think it might be. Maybe we should just follow that pattern and use it in a more integrated way.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** More in a culinary fashion.

**Caller:** Yes, thanks, Sarah.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that we're eating our medicine instead of taking capsules. Remember too, a lot of traditional cultures make teas out of these things. They're not just swallowing tablespoons of turmeric root. They're putting some in their cooking, and if they're going to make it into a medicine, they make it into a tea, which helps to extract the medicinal constituents, like a tincture does, without having to have all the extra fiber and potential extra heavy metals that are in herbs that don't get extracted in the tea and the tincture like they would in the root.

**Andrew Murray:** That's a very good point. Having looked at these botanicals and put them through ICP-MS to see what levels of heavy metals—arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury—are within these herbs as part of a GMP process, I know from raw data that the plant root itself contains very high levels in some cases, and the extracts contain virtually none. The extract process is very clean compared to the root of the actual herb if you were going to consume it. We've done shows on this with fish in the ocean and how much arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury is in them. The same goes for any plant material that you would ingest in the powder or capsule form. Which is why we're not at all in agreement with capsules and powders over extracts, because extracts do not bring out the heavy metal content of the raw material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And also, tinctures concentrate the medicinal constituents.

**Caller:** Well, thank you very much. I appreciate your help.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you, Margaret, for your call.

## Caller: Clarification on Sugar

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, I think we have another call on the line. Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

**Caller:** Hi, my name is Margie from Pepperwood. I would like a clarification on when Dr. Peat says "sugar," does that mean just fructose or honey, natural sugars? I can take my answer off the air.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. So, what about sugar? Do we just want to get that from carbohydrates, or do you want to get it from sugar or honey? I think Dr. Peat would say to get it from honey and sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can come from healthy starches and other more complex carbohydrates. But the problem is some of those, like sweet potatoes, are such mixtures. They have woody material and fats, indigestible things mixed in with the otherwise useful carbohydrates. So you can't just say that any old starch is going to be equivalent to glucose or sucrose or honey. It depends on whether it's digestible.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can I go back to the sugar and cancer issue that you touched on earlier? Every cell in the body needs glucose to operate. So if you don't eat any kind of sugar, your body's going to turn on a harmful metabolism to make sugar, and that involves lactic acid. Correct, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And high cortisol. Cortisol is necessary to mobilize and break down protein to make amino acids and glucose, which also promotes cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Cortisol also promotes cancer. It's a stress promoter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It weakens your immunity against it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah, it lowers your immune system. Like everybody knows, steroids suppress the immune system, and cortisol is a natural steroid your body will make when you starve your body of glucose. I know, Doctor, you said that honey and white cane sugar are identical in their structure. They both are sucrose, which is half fructose and half glucose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And the pure fructose on the market, for many people, has allergenic effects because of its manufacturing in a more complex way than with sucrose. You simply concentrate the juice and remove the impurities from the cane juice to make white sucrose. But to make fructose, chemical and enzyme processes are used that introduce some trace allergens. So you have to be cautious about using what they call powdered fructose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you would recommend honey or cane sugar over fructose because of the process that the fructose goes through, even though fructose is a more nutritious sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the other thing too is, I know, Doctor, you don't recommend people just eat white sugar by the tablespoon without balancing it with a healthy saturated fat like coconut oil or butter and a protein, or at least with just a protein, so that it's not just an instant sugar spike.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can be used in a pure form, for example, as a mild analgesic for babies. They give them a bit of pure sucrose as sort of a painkiller. And in areas that lack penicillin, a big wound that otherwise would be fatal has been packed with pure, store-bought white sugar. It has a germicidal effect as well as a protective effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, honey does too. They pack wounds with honey as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. So it has specific therapeutic effects besides its protective nutritional effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. I hope that answered that caller's question.

## Final Thoughts on mTOR Inhibitors

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, good. It's almost three minutes to the hour.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One thing I wanted to mention before we're finished is that vitamin D is a very important inhibitor of mTOR. It works on many other levels. It inhibits things that would promote mTOR and reduces the processes that would amplify a little inflammation into a big inflammation, such as blocking prostaglandin formation.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, excellent. Dr. Peat, I do appreciate you joining us again on the show. Thank you so much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat.
