# Food Additives and Ingredients

**Andrew Murray:** We are finishing up last month's discussion on food additives and the detrimental health effects of ingredients that may not be listed on labels. In England, they have fairly strict food laws where everything has to be disclosed, whereas in America, a certain percentage of food ingredients legally don't have to be detailed.

I want to discuss dough conditioners and rennets. Most people probably don't know dough conditioners exist in bread. Could you say a little bit about potassium bromate, which is a fairly common additive to bread, and what likely negative health effects it has?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Besides any changes that it makes to the proteins and starches—which will make them more likely to be allergenic—any that gets into the system is going to be an antithyroid agent at least.

**Andrew Murray:** So it is thyroid suppressive. Regarding cheeses, our family has leaned toward European cheeses because their manufacturing is more traditional. In the States for the last 15 years, genetically modified yeasts used to culture cheese have become widespread. It is difficult to get a cheese that isn't made using a genetically engineered yeast. What do you know about the trouble with these versus using traditional rennet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The worst problem is that they are using things to carry the microbial enzymes. There is always some debris from the *Aspergillus* or whatever microbe they are using as a source of the enzymes. The genetic modification makes them somewhat different, but they are already toxic and allergenic in themselves. Even if they were naturally evolved organisms, any debris from them that goes along with the enzyme is risky.

Even worse than simply having microbial enzymes where there used to be animal enzymes, they are using seaweed materials—either carrageenan or other things—to distribute, emulsify, or mix the enzymes efficiently so they can be canned and dumped into the batch. One of the compounds being used to make microspheres to enclose the microbial enzymes has been used to make dental molds. One person died shortly after having some of that put in his mouth, and a high proportion of dentistry students had serious allergic reactions when practicing with it. These things are routinely being added to foods to carry other products, and as a packaging or carrying material, they don't show up on the labels at all.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even on the labels for cheese, sometimes it just says "rennet." That could mean animal rennet, or it could mean vegetable rennet, which never really comes from a vegetable source—it is usually genetically modified or grown on a mold. Of course, there are natural rennets available like fig juice and cardoon thistle, but no companies use those anymore. So you are saying not only are these enzymes problematic, but also the carriers used to make it convenient for the cheese maker.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and they are being used as carriers for other foods. It is increasingly common to use seaweed materials, which are potentially deadly. One of the other most deadly allergens was sulfite, which killed a few people eating restaurant salads or seafoods that had been deodorized with it. Even after it was recognized that it could be deadly, it was still used in drugs sold for treating asthma patients.

There was a product called Alupent. A girl who had almost died in the hospital after being treated once was about to be treated with it again. She grabbed the bottle and ran; right on the bottle, it said "contains sodium metabisulfite." I wrote to the FDA, the drug companies, and the *Journal of the American Medical Association*. They all admitted it was a problem that could kill people, but they went on selling it for years without publishing warnings.

**Andrew Murray:** The wine and beer industry say sulfites keep wines stable. Sulfites are prevalent as sodium metabisulfite, both as a cleaning agent and to halt fermentation. Apart from asthma, what are the toxic side effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The allergic reaction is really the only serious toxic effect, but a person never knows when they are going to have a reaction. If they haven't eaten for a long time or if their thyroid happens to have fallen, there can be a sudden increase in allergic sensitivity because blood sugar powerfully controls the release of histamine. In experiments, they found that the mildest allergen would kill animals with shock if their blood sugar was lowered to 50% of normal. If they doubled the blood sugar of the animals, even the deadly allergen would only cause slight reddening of their nose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That supports the motto of eating frequently throughout the day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Eating frequently avoids several stress reactions, including fluctuations in blood sugar.

## Sugar, Metabolism, and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Many people are stuck on the doctrine that sugar is bad for you and causes diabetes. How would you defend sugar's role in a healthy organism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of people cite Otto Warburg's work in the 1920s, in which he showed that cancer cells can't use oxygen efficiently, so they use sugar at an extremely high rate. People argue that if cancer cells live on sugar, you shouldn't eat it. But that isn't a valid argument because when you have even a small tumor, the body senses danger and increases its production of cortisol.

One of the very early events in cancer is a chronic elevation of cortisol. Cortisol turns your tissues to sugar. If you don't eat sugar, your body wastes away faster. The wasting away of the immune system and other tissues is what kills most people with cancer.

There have been experiments where high concentrations of glucose were put into the artery feeding a tumor in an extremity. The sugar itself caused the cancer to die. So, sugar not only spares your immune system, brain, and other tissues, but if delivered at a high enough concentration, it allows something to happen that can kill the cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss the science surrounding current cancer theory versus the "cancer field" theory. We have traditionally been taught that cancer cells are outside the body's control, that they ignore apoptosis (programmed cell death), and that they are immortal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything is wrong with that belief. Going back to the mid-19th century, people saw that cancer arises in a "field" of visibly abnormal cells. After this inflamed area persisted for a long time, mutant cells might appear. This concept has developed over 150 years: anything irritating or destructive that the body can't overcome will cause progressive stressing or inflammation of the tissue. You can develop a cancer before there is any identifiable mutation.

Harry Rubin at Berkeley has shown that there is definitely a pre-mutational, definitive cancer condition. In the cancer, the tissue as a whole is so unhealthy that mutations occur in the DNA, but the DNA event is down the road from what is actually causing the cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you are suggesting that chronic inflammation or injury to a tissue eventually causes the cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you look at the functioning of a tumor, the cells are very sick and do not have a long lifespan. What you see in a biopsy are very mortal cells that will probably die in the next couple of divisions. The doctrine that cancer cells are immortal and body cells are mortal is completely backwards.

The Hayflick limit—that cells can only divide 50 times—was invented to reinforce the DNA-centric view of biology. Stem cell work has shown that all cells seem to be basically stem cells and immortal given the right circumstances. The function of the tumor is a process of healing and regeneration that can't come to completion. Something is missing that would allow the tumor to let the sick cells die while the healthy cells return to normal functioning.

**Andrew Murray:** How does radiation affect this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies of X-ray treated tumors found that the X-ray accelerated the death of the original tumor cells, but it actually accelerated the ability of the tumor to call for help and recruit stem cells from the bloodstream or adjacent tissues. The same signals sent out by inflammation call for assistance and replacement cells. So, when a tumor is irradiated, it increases its ability to recruit stem cells. The reason the tumor keeps growing after radiation is that you have increased the injury.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you see metastasis in light of cancer being a recruitment of stem cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s through the 50s, tests were made implanting pieces of cancer into people. It was found that people who already had cancer would accept a transplant, while healthy people didn't suffer consequences; their bodies rejected it. Metastasis, which is simply a self-induced transplantation, involves a defect in the whole organism that makes it susceptible to receiving a transplant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that why radiation is used—because it does kill some tumor cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It stops the cells that are irradiated right in their tracks. But it also stops the growth of healthy tissue. Within 30 minutes of irradiation, there is a burst of histamine, serotonin, and tryptase enzymes that cause inflammation. This leads to a chronic overproduction of collagen and fibrosis. If the body can't heal this scarred, atrophied tissue, it recruits cells to try to repair it, creating a risk of future cancer.

## Immune System and Energy Production

**Andrew Murray:** Is the current theory valid that cancer cells have different surface markers (MHCs) than normal body cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are degenerating, so they can go off in many directions and are often killed easily because they are recognized as abnormal. The normal function of the immune system is to maintain the proper development and form of the body. Phagocytosis (eating) of sick or injured tissue is at the center of the immune system. Germs don't necessarily trigger the immune system unless they damage something.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding constant irritation—like smoking leading to lung cancer—how does energy play a role?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The higher a cell's energy capacity, the more it takes to irritate it. Keeping cellular energy at a maximum means you are fairly immune to irritation. If something impairs energy production, almost anything becomes irritating.

In cigarette smoke, there are irritants and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). These are carcinogens, but they are also estrogens. Behind those irritants is carbon monoxide, which blocks oxygen use, making the cell more susceptible to stimulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do those hydrocarbons suppress the thyroid as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The work of the Pullmans in the 1940s and 50s showed that the electronic behavior of these aromatic hydrocarbons acts as signals to cells in the same way estrogen does. Drug and government interests diverted that research, financing the molecular biology approach instead, which tries to explain these hormonal actions as nothing but mutations. But their main mechanism for mutating DNA is by acting as hormones that deplete the energy of the cell while over-exciting it.

**Andrew Murray:** How does a human energize themselves to improve ATP production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, you need essential vitamins, minerals, and adequate protein. But sugar is essential for keeping your thyroid functioning without resorting to cortisone overproduction. Unless the thyroid is specifically signaled to turn off by things like polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and estrogens, essential nutrients plus sugar will allow the thyroid to function.

Once the weakening process starts, the intestine becomes permeable ("leaky gut"), and toxins from bacteria leak into the bloodstream.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To specify, PUFAs are vegetable oils: corn, soy, canola, cottonseed, and sesame seed oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1980s, French experiments showed that every stage of thyroid hormone production and transport was blocked in proportion to the number of double bonds in the unsaturated fat. Monounsaturated fats were slightly inhibiting. Two double bonds (like linoleic acid) were much more inhibiting. The triply or quadruply unsaturated fats, such as fish oils and omega-3 fats, are the most inhibiting to the energy system.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the bottom line is: eat coconut oil and butter, avoid other oils, use olive oil in moderation, and keep blood sugar up with fruit.

## Caller Questions: Sugar vs. Starch

**Caller:** I have questions about sugar. You sound like you are saying "sugar is okay." As far as I know, refined white sugar is addicting and causes obesity and diabetes. I assume fruit sugar is okay, but can you clarify the difference between eating fruit versus candy and cookies with white flour?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starches and proteins are very powerful stimulants to insulin. The combination of starch and polyunsaturated fats causes the greatest disturbance of blood sugar—much more than eating white sugar. The polyunsaturated fats block the ability to use sugar, so cells experience a sugar deficiency and turn on stress reactions. Starches are pure glucose rather than a 50/50 mix of fructose and glucose, so starches are much more powerful stimulants to insulin and stress reactions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Starches like bread, pasta, and chips have a glycemic index around 140. White sugar is around 99. Fruit is around 75.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The potassium content of fruit is what keeps the insulin much lower. If you eat bread, you get very little potassium. If you eat fruit with the same amount of sugar, the potassium acts somewhat like insulin, so you have very little stimulation of fat production.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've also found that white sugar, because it is filtered, is less allergenic than raw brown sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you centrifuge brown sugar, the first wash is blackstrap molasses. I've noticed a smoky taste in blackstrap because it is common practice to burn the cane fields to harvest. Also, if you boil sugar at high temperatures, impurities cause polymerization reactions that create allergens. The brown material contains biological materials that, when heated, can make intense allergens.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the hierarchy is:
1.  Fresh, ripe fruit and milk sugar.
2.  Raw honey.
3.  White sugar (if you must).
4.  Brown sugar (less preferable).
5.  Starches (least preferable due to low minerals and high insulin spike).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. That stimulation of insulin leads to a surge of cortisol, which destroys protein in your tissues to keep sugar up. Eating too much protein without fruit will waste protein. I've seen people eating two pounds of meat a day who showed signs of protein deficiency because of super amounts of cortisol.

## Caller Questions: Depression and Inflammation

**Caller:** I was told that folic acid helps depression. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruits are very good sources of folic acid. It is needed to make nerve transmitters.

**Caller:** I cut out everything but butter and stopped using vegetable oils, and it gave me a lot more energy.

**Andrew Murray:** What is being done currently in cancer treatment that you are excited about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** More people are recognizing the importance of aspirin and stopping inflammation. As we age, we accumulate polyunsaturated fats in our tissues. Under stress, these circulate and produce inflammatory prostaglandins. Aspirin is an anti-aging defense against a lifetime of accumulating PUFAs. It is now known that chronic use prevents essentially all kinds of cancer to some degree.

**Andrew Murray:** How much aspirin would you suggest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin should always be backed up with plenty of vitamin K—natural K1 and K2, not synthetic. Vitamin K is structurally extremely similar to a botanical drug called Lapacho (or lapachol), which has been used for generations to treat cancer. Emodin from aloe and cascara is also structurally analogous to vitamin K. Tetracycline, the antibiotic, has anti-cancer action not by killing cells, but by protecting the mitochondria from being poisoned, similar to cascara.

**Caller:** Do you have any feelings about quercetin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You get similar things in fruits. I think oranges have substances that are even safer and better than quercetin, such as naringin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Nettle leaf is also high in vitamin K and contains quercetin.

**Caller:** If using white willow bark (MediHerb), what would be an average amount for what Dr. Peat is recommending?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For an anti-inflammatory effect, probably one tablet daily. For an anti-cancer dose, it would likely be much higher, perhaps nine tablets. We use a standardized white willow bark powder because you would have to drink gallons of tea to get the therapeutic dose of salicylic acid.

## Closing Thoughts

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you think of the American Cancer Society and current cancer treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see a lot of fraud. They sponsored a lecture tour to show they had cured lung cancer and leukemia, but they used phony statistics. The ending of atomic bomb testing accounted for the drop in childhood leukemia, not their treatments.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why does research on anti-cancer substances like aspirin or cascara never reach the hospitals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drug companies want a drug that you pay all your money for and keep taking as long as you are alive. They don't want people getting cured with aspirin, fruit juice, or Pau d'Arco.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to wrap up. As Dr. Peat says in his newsletters: "While a lie spreads around the world, truth is just putting her boots on."
