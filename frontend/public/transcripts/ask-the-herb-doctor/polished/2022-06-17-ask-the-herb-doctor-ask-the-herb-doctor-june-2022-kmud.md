## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. This is June 17, 2022. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to the show. This month's topic is going to be around food, the corporations' control of food, and some ongoing numbers and statistics from the COVID fallout. We're going to get into political discourse regarding big companies in Ukraine and fertilizer production. Hopefully, we will also get to the topic of the baby milk shortage, follow that up with some artificial meat topics, and, as always, have the great pleasure of having Dr. Peat’s superb overview.

He has spent 40 to 50 years studying these subjects and another three decades living through the events unfolding now. He has a well-rounded view of many different subjects, including alternative medicine, and has spent a large part of his life looking at the research—the factual information, not just opinion. Very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## COVID Fallout, Insurance Data, and Technocracy

**Andrew Murray:** I just wanted to wrap up last month's discourse. We talked about genetic modification and corporations with patent rights on intellectual property. Monsanto, with their genetically engineered seeds, and the moratorium on natural products seems to have been put to one side. Naturally occurring products like corn, wheat, and potatoes have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified versions. I think this also runs into vaccine technology and the emerging infections we've gone through since the mid-1990s, with COVID obviously being the major part of the prior two years.

I also wanted to remind people that the lawyer Reiner Fuellmich has a huge amount of data on his website. It is a chronologically documented series of allegations charging crimes against humanity for many organizations, institutions, and governments. That website is [ratical.org](https://ratical.org) under "Pandemic Parallax View." It lists every detail beginning from the Wuhan lab, Fauci, and the funding, up to the present point.

Last month, we also mentioned that the United Nations has changed the terminology from "technocracy" to "Green Economy" and "Sustainable Development." It sounds innocuous—who doesn't want sustainability? I want local markets and people growing food locally, not huge corporations shipping food globally. But the words "Sustainable Development" have been couched to embrace this technocracy, which began around the 1920s.

Opening up this month, something caught my eye: the fifth-largest life insurance company in the US has just paid out 163% more for deaths of working people—ages 18 to 64—not old people ready to die. The head of OneAmerica, an Indianapolis-based insurance company, said the death rate is up a stunning 40% from pre-pandemic levels among working-age people. Lincoln National reported a 163% increase in death benefits paid out in 2021.

To quote OneAmerica CEO Scott Davison: "We are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business." He noted this is consistent across every player in the business. Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a one-in-200-year catastrophe would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic levels. So 40% is unheard of.

What is driving this unprecedented surge in all-cause mortality? If this holds true, the genetic vaccines so aggressively promoted have failed, and the campaign to prevent early treatment has contributed to a massive, avoidable loss of life. Dr. Peat, I know you've been talking about this since the beginning of 2020. What are your interpretations of these insurance companies' disclosures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several other companies since then have reported very similar increased mortality—around 40% in the working age group. Insurance companies generally have extremely accurate statistics, better than governments as a rule, because their income depends on exactness. It is the scientific basis for saying that it wasn't the virus that was responsible, but the vaccination. That is when the 40% rise began. It fits what the skeptical virologists have been claiming: that the mortality is going to be far worse from the vaccine than from whatever occurred from the virus.

**Andrew Murray:** It was noted that it was all-cause mortality in young people, and a lot of it had to do with damage and disability. The amount of money paid out due to disability claims is a stunning part of the numbers.

## The Origins of Omicron

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on, regarding Omicron: Do you feel Omicron is a naturally produced variant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has the most bizarre gene sequences of all the variants. Starting with the Wuhan strain, the other variants show a series of mutations building on each other. The most recent ones prior to Omicron showed exactly the same series of mutations incorporated—it was definitely that virus improving its survivability by mutating.

But Omicron is unique. It didn't show any mutations after Wuhan. While the Wuhan virus was going through all these changes, nothing was happening to the Omicron sequence. Suddenly, when it pops up, it is essentially the pristine Wuhan virus with a new series built right on the original virus. It has none of the history of natural mutation, as if it was being held aside and going through a different series of mutations, as if it wasn't in the world at all for these intervening years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you are saying the original COVID went through mutations you can track, and then all of a sudden Omicron looked like the original with just some alterations, suggesting it had been produced in a lab?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And those mutations made it much less harmful. It looks as if someone was preparing a product to end the pandemic by turning it off with a fairly harmless virus.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If people have Omicron and develop antibodies naturally, will they be better able to fight the original Delta or other variants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it won't especially affect them. But if it's the dominant virus and it's very harmless, then the other one just isn't going to be around to cause trouble.

## Ukraine, Monsanto, and Land Control

**Andrew Murray:** I read a 2014 article by the Oakland Institute outlining a global corporate takeover of agricultural land in Ukraine. Ukraine has been hailed as the breadbasket of Europe with over 32 million hectares of fertile black soil.

Ukraine's agricultural land was under a moratorium that banned its sale. When Ukraine separated from the Soviet Union in 1990, land was distributed in parcels to people living on collectivized farms. In 2001, they passed a Land Code giving people titles, but there was a moratorium on sales. Investors tried to circumvent this by leasing fields or buying shares of existing agribusinesses. Agribusiness giants like Monsanto, Cargill, and DuPont have been attracted to this. Dr. Peat, how does this tie into the current situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone has heard about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) offering Ukraine a $40 billion loan if they would stop the moratorium, specifically so Monsanto and other giant corporations could concentrate ownership on a big corporate scale. There was a coup to make that happen because the elected presidency had rejected the IMF fund. The IMF, working with the World Bank and other Western authorities, wanted to reverse that and stop the moratorium. They supported the coup, which was very clear that they were going to adopt laws allowing Monsanto to take over. When the coup happened, that did take place. They had to get rid of the legally elected president and establish the Zelensky government supporting the Monsanto privatization system.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you see Russia's involvement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Part of the Monsanto thing is that they want to use chemicals—Roundup—to make the profitability of certain giant land corporations favorable. The European Union had opposed the US policy of supporting Monsanto and genetic modification. There was a conflict between Western Europe and the anti-GMO people.

Historically, Russia had been passing laws to promote organic farming and to outlaw GMOs. They were aiming for 100% freedom from GMOs and naturally from Monsanto. That really was the polarization for the coup regarding the IMF loan. When the elected president made a deal with Russia for a loan that would bypass the IMF, that was the actual moment when the coup took place.

**Andrew Murray:** I read a couple of years ago that Vladimir Putin was boasting he was going to make Russia the biggest organic food producer in the world.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I thought GMOs were still banned in Europe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are wobbling on the issue. There is still opposition, but now the war for Monsanto has affected the West. They aren't pushing so hard to oppose the GMOs.

## Manufactured Food Shortages

**Andrew Murray:** Ukraine is a big exporter of fertilizer. I wonder how the fertilizer shortage plays into this, along with the talk of food shortages. How politically motivated is this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can see many specific things in which it's been openly promoted. For example, Union Pacific Railroad announced that they just weren't going to ship all the fertilizer the farmers needed. That preceded by several weeks the announcement that they were not going to allow the shipment and sale of urea, which is used in the diesel motors of trucks (DEF). By restricting the availability of this urea fuel modifier, they can turn off truck delivery too. But as a railroad, they simply said they're not going to ship all the fertilizer that's ordered.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why did they say that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one knows, but it seems they are controlled by the giant fund BlackRock, and that is also just openly intending to turn off the food economy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they want to create a shortage for monetary gain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yes. If you look at the pattern over the last several years, just weeks before the pandemic, Klaus Schwab was saying, "We've done our best to use the carbon dioxide/climate change mistaken science to fulfill our purpose of controlling the overall production. But now, luckily, we've got something much better." He implied that in just a period of two or three years, they would be able to turn off the national and world production of everything—ordinary daily economy, including food and all the necessaries of life.

**Andrew Murray:** You can't make this stuff up. This reminds me of the discourse I heard with Rima Laibow back in 2006 regarding Codex Alimentarius. It’s a playbook from the emergence of technocracy through to global governments and one-world currency.

## Baby Formula Crisis and PUFA

**Andrew Murray:** Getting to the baby milk crisis—I know you have a lot to say about soy and PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids). What do you think about this shortage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The soy formula had its own terrible side effects in immature animals. The estrogenic factors associated with the proteins used in making the milk substitute cause deformed genitals in the developing young and later promote tumors. So, plant-based milk formulas were a terrible problem.

Then you have Nestlé innovations, basically selling dehydrated cow milk as a basis for people around the world to mix up at home. In many poor countries, clean water to mix it with is absent, so they were doing something very counter-social and dangerous.

Even in the US, if people couldn't produce milk, they could simply make a formula based on cow milk. When it isn't dehydrated, the reaction on the immune system is less harmful. To take a non-human milk and introduce it at the very beginning will cause some antigenic differences, but if it's made from fresh cow milk, that's a lot safer than dehydrated. Every time you dehydrate a living substance, you kill it and oxidize some of the proteins, amino acids, and especially the fatty acids. The cholesterol is oxidized and made toxic.

There is a whole anti-science that has grown up to defend the industry's use of dehydrated milk and added polyunsaturated fatty acids. They argue that human milk contains more PUFA than cow milk, so they say the baby must be given a supplement of N-3 (Omega-3) fatty acids because almost all babies at birth have evidence of a deficiency.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's because the placenta filtered it out.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. It is recognized by the body as something to be excluded during pregnancy. But they reverse that and say you need to supplement everyone because everyone is deficient. They extend that to say the aged brain contains increased amounts of N-3 PUFA, so it should be there. Meanwhile, the old brain has deteriorated in proportion to the reduction of mitochondrial energy production, and that reduction corresponds to the increased presence of N-3 PUFA in the brain. At every point, they've twisted the science.

## Caller: Menopause Support

**Andrew Murray:** We had a caller who wanted to ask a question off the air.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The caller wanted to know if you could talk about good things for menopause, specifically for brain fog and nausea. Ginger is always great for nausea.

**Andrew Murray:** Good nootropics? I know you support anti-stress substances like pregnenolone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, all of those things. Coffee, for example, and aspirin—things that promote mitochondrial oxidative use.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And herbal support would be Vitex (Chaste Berry) and Black Cohosh. Those are very effective at helping mitigate menopausal symptoms.

## Synthetic Milk vs. Cow Milk

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, back to the milk. All baby formula is dehydrated. So when you say make a formula out of milk, would you suggest adding anything to fresh cow milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can adjust the amount of fat and water if it makes it more palatable to the baby, but just as is, it'll work.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about this talk in the news of synthetic breast milk made in a laboratory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, probably not good. It might have certain similarities to breast milk, but it's definitely going to be a synthetic chemical material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you think that would be preferable to cow's milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure [Cow's milk is preferable]. Assuming the mother is eating properly, human milk reflects the human diet. We don't have a rumen. The cow can eat grass, weeds, and quite a lot of polyunsaturated fats and detoxify them in the rumen. As a rule, if the woman is eating well, her milk is going to be better than cow's milk.

## Artificial Meat and Protein in Aging

**Andrew Murray:** What about the subject of artificial meat? They seem to be seeking to separate people from the natural world. I'm not saying everyone needs to drink milk, but the demonization of it skews the information. You've mentioned research recently about protein intake for older people necessarily needing to be decreased. You've never been big on muscle meat, preferring the whole animal—gelatin, broth, etc.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For many years, people have been aware that with aging, the metabolic rate slows down. Broda Barnes was thinking about the importance of the metabolic rate. He had been using a supplement of two grains of Armour Thyroid. He decided to go on a high-protein diet when he was around 60 and found that he had to double his dose of thyroid hormone to maintain his functioning. This shows that for an older person, what seems to be a good level of protein can actually be very powerfully suppressive to your thyroid function.

## Caller: Corporate Control of Seeds

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next call.

**Caller (Arcata):** I just wanted to make a comment on the general trend where big corporations want to control everything. I was talking to a vendor at the farmer's market, and she had to buy seeds. I expect that over time, the seed supply is going to be completely controlled by big companies. It would behoove people to learn how to grow and save their own seed to keep it from being contaminated with genes inserted to prevent reproduction.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you. This really applies to people fortunate enough to have a garden. It’s happened in China, where hundreds of millions were pulled out of rural locations and brought to cities. When you are in the cities under their domain without a connection to the natural world, that is when all of this breaks down. It reminds me of the Tower of Babel—confusion and a disconnect from natural creation.

## Closing Thoughts: Is There Hope?

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you've seen governments come and go. Is there any hope for the world?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm still hopeful. Like Reiner Fuellmich said, we have to do everything legal and possible to try to prosecute these people. But at some point, he's going to count on some kind of a "cosmic bailout" for us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wait, Reiner is counting on a cosmic bailout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I forgot his exact phrase, but he said he couldn't explain it rationally, but he had this confidence that the universe wasn't going to let it turn out the way the World Economic Forum hopes.

**Andrew Murray:** That is hopeful. Thank you so much again, Dr. Peat, for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you and good night.

## Outro

**Andrew Murray:** I just wanted to finish by saying that the connection is undoubtable between technocracy and dehumanization through lockdowns and social isolation. The Orwellian reality we are now in must be resisted vehemently through peaceful protests and political involvement.

**Caller:** Hello?

**Andrew Murray:** We have very little time left.

**Caller:** They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. You seem to think getting treatment is better than the vaccine. Why do you think the vaccine is worse for you than COVID itself?

**Andrew Murray:** The information is out there for anybody who wants to search for it, though you likely won't find it on Google or Facebook due to fact-checkers. We are out of time, but I want to give credit to Dr. Peat. His website is [RayPeat.com](http://raypeat.com). He has plenty of scientifically referenced articles pulled from medical journals.

My name is Andrew Murray, and we'll talk to you again in July.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you for listening.
