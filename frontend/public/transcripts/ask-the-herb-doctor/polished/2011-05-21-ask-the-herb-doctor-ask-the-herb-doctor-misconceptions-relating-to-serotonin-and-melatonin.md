## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice. We get a lot of positive feedback concerning Dr. Ray Peat on our shows, so he is joining us again tonight. We want to explore misconceptions in medicine and marketing related to serotonin and melatonin, with wider implications for medical drugs in general, as well as carrying on last month's topic on the Fukushima incident.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, could you please describe your academic and professional background for those who haven't heard you before?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After I had studied and taught literature and linguistics, I decided that to understand consciousness and language, I should study the brain. When I started graduate school specializing in nerve biology, I discovered that the brain scientists were just as dogmatic as the linguistic theorists. So I went into general physiology, specializing in reproductive endocrinology. That was one aspect that got me interested in the biological effects of radiation. I had been interested in the fallout from nuclear tests for many years, but when I saw that the biology of estrogen was very similar to the biology of radiation damage, I tried to understand exactly what was going on in a cell that caused identical biochemical events to occur, either from a dose of X-rays or a dose of estrogen.

## The Fukushima Crisis and Radiation

**Andrew Murray:** To wrap up last month's presentation on the Fukushima dilemma, the power plant is unfortunately still smoldering. The cores are too hot to deal with, and it looks like they will continue smoking away. In the early stages, websites like RadNet (EPA) were giving out measurements, and we could see the plume spreading across the Pacific. Sarah, do we want to cover the results to date?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I found a PDF on the EPA's website that lists reported uranium-234 in Anaheim and Riverside on March 15th, and in Seattle and San Francisco on March 18th. I haven't seen an updated file recently. It seems there is iodine being detected in rainwater and air all over the country.

**Andrew Murray:** There is a retired nuclear scientist named Arnie Gundersen who noted that this was a level 7 accident early on. Dr. Peat, in terms of what is potentially happening here, what is the best advice people can take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The basic thing is to eat old food—canned or dried food—and avoid fresh vegetables as far as you can. For example, aged cheese is going to be completely safe. To avoid iodine damage to the thyroid gland, you can protect yourself by saturating yourself with iodine from kelp, eating canned oysters and other shellfish, or even painting tincture of iodine on your skin to absorb it. You can saturate yourself with iodine to protect the thyroid gland during the time that radioactive iodine is still active, which is roughly six weeks after its creation.

**Andrew Murray:** What is your impression of potassium iodide as a supplement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has its own long-range, potentially harmful effects. Even one milligram a day in a chronic diet is known to be associated with thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and probably an increased rate of thyroid cancer. You don't want to take any thyroid supplement beyond a normal dietary sufficiency, except in the presence of serious radioactive iodine exposure. Considering the risk from the radioactive iodine, I think a few milligrams of potassium iodide per day is a reasonable balance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, a half-teaspoon of kelp powder a couple of times a week, or a couple of milligrams of potassium iodide if you are in an area with radioactive iodine, shouldn't be too harmful for several weeks for most people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, though a few people have a strange hypersensitivity to iodine. You want to test the first dose with a very small amount, because some people get an asthma attack or other violent symptoms.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Regarding radiation monitoring, the EPA's RadNet data showed beta counts in Eureka, California, up to 50 counts per minute even before the catastrophe, and it continues reaching that level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 50 per second is where I would be seriously concerned. 50 per minute wouldn't be bad.

## Serotonin: The Stress Hormone

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to our main topic: serotonin, SSRIs, and melatonin. People generally believe that serotonin is a "feel good" hormone. Dr. Peat, what do you have to say about serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has many responses to injury, and serotonin and estrogen are two of the most basic, primitive responses to generalized injury. If you get sunburned, in the next few hours you can measure a large amount of serotonin in the urine. That same thing happens for any kind of injury, including ionizing radiation. Dental X-rays are enough to activate the production of serotonin.

Its basic purpose is to activate simple things, like shifting away from oxidative metabolism to glycolytic metabolism, or even a hibernating shutdown of systems. At an extreme overproduction of serotonin, you tend to go into a hibernating state. Animals produce more serotonin before they go into hibernation for the winter. It keeps the machinery running while shutting down expensive biological processes.

## Ocean Currents and Debris

**Caller:** Does anybody know how long it takes for the ocean currents from Japan to come over to the West Coast? Also, is anyone monitoring the ocean contamination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it moves something like 80 to 100 miles a day.

**Andrew Murray:** Since it is roughly 4,000 to 6,000 miles, it will take some time.

**Caller (Later):** I heard on the BBC that it will take three years for the parts of houses washed out from the tsunami to start washing up on beaches here.

## Radiation, Serotonin, and Genetic Damage

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and 60s, the Soviets were researching ways to defend against intense radiation doses. They studied serotonin and looked for safe analogs to use defensively. A big dose of radiation puts the organism in a state where it can tolerate the trauma, reducing mortality for a given dose.

However, for the kind of low dose we are likely to be exposed to, serotonin is what causes the bulk of the damage. If you give cells in a culture dish the amount of X-ray exposure you get with dental X-rays, those cells will emit photons—light produced by cellular damage—for over an hour. If you put unexposed cells in the water with those injured cells, the unexposed cells will begin mutating hours later due to the emissions, such as serotonin, released into the water. This "bystander effect" can cause mutations for 30 generations.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So even if the radiation exposure is small, it could cause our cells to express more serotonin, leading to long-term negative effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Probably one single atom fissioning in your body will cause a few cells to produce those toxic communicating substances. If the person is healthy, the rest of the body will shut down those excited signals. It is a matter of balancing the vitality of the whole organism against the number of injured cells.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What can we do to keep ourselves in a vital state to quell that inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High thyroid function and the magnesium taken up into the cells under the influence of thyroid are the best ways to accelerate the repair process. Animal studies found that estrogenic effects from radiation could be antagonized by a good dose of progesterone or testosterone, and the usual nutritional things that help the body control estrogen. Estrogen and serotonin are the things we have the best handle on for protecting ourselves from long-range effects.

## SSRIs vs. Serotonin Uptake Promoters

**Andrew Murray:** What is your opinion on Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To the extent that they act on serotonin, I think it is good to look for alternatives. Much of it is just advertising—the idea that they are a "happy pill." Actually, they act on many different processes, increasing adrenaline and dopamine, and activating or inactivating enzymes. No one really knows the full extent of what they are doing.

There are a few very effective antidepressants that are the opposite: Serotonin Uptake *Promoters*. The best studied is Tianeptine (brand name Stabilon). It promotes the uptake of serotonin, so it is less active in the synapse. It turns out to have beneficial effects on arthritis, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions related to high serotonin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So taking something that blocks serotonin could help with diabetes and arthritis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is a whole class of anti-serotonin drugs becoming popular. For example, Ondansetron is used to prevent nausea from radiation exposure. Another is Lisuride. These are based on the indole molecular structure of serotonin but modified to block its effects. Bromocriptine is another one used to treat pituitary tumors because prolactin is promoted by stress, serotonin, or radiation.

## Melatonin and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** How about melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has enzymes activated by stress. In the pineal gland, adrenaline is the signal that rises in darkness to activate the enzyme which converts serotonin into melatonin. This same enzyme system can be found in an inflamed breast or a rheumatic knee joint. In these situations, melatonin seems to be performing the same function: eliminating serotonin, which is the actual pro-inflammatory substance. Since serotonin stimulates cell division and inflammation, the presence of this enzyme is considered an approach for preventing or treating breast cancer.

**Caller:** I understand that serotonin is converted by adrenaline into melatonin. Does melatonin act as an antagonist to serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Besides eliminating serotonin by converting it, I suspect melatonin itself acts as a defense or antagonist against serotonin, blocking effects like free radical production.

## High Fructose Corn Syrup and Gut Health

**Caller:** We have a huge problem with diabetes, likely related to high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Could the influx of SSRIs also be contributing to diabetes and obesity in children?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A study at UCLA analyzed corn syrup sweeteners in soft drinks. They found it contained the claimed fructose and glucose, but when hydrolyzed, it also contained polysaccharides—starch-like materials containing four to five times the calories of the original sugar. These polysaccharides are not easily digested by human enzymes and likely feed bacteria in the intestine. This produces fermentation products, including lactic acid, which cause the intestine to increase its production of serotonin. This serotonin is absorbed into circulation and affects behavior. Anxiety in animals increases in proportion to the fermentation of these starch-like molecules.

## Bee Stings and Cortisol

**Caller:** I keep honeybees and get stung. I've heard bee stings are anti-inflammatory, yet I get inflamed at the site. What is going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard that it is the high cortisol production from the pain, as well as the histamine and serotonin from the venom, that causes the effect. A very painful bee sting will activate your adrenals to the point that it can relieve a swollen knee via cortisol counter-irritation. It is analogous to how the trauma of surgery can sometimes cure things in animal research simply due to the stress response.

## The Receptor Myth

**Andrew Murray:** The pharmaceutical industry claims that SSRIs increase the receptors for serotonin, accounting for long-term effects. Can you comment on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you block a transmitter, the body adaptively increases the receptors. Increasing exposure to something usually decreases the receptors in an adaptive process. So everything ends up more or less the way it started.

The whole idea of the "receptor" is often used by the industry to make things simple for advertising. The state of the organism and the cell determines how a substance affects it. It isn't necessarily that you make more receptor protein, but that the energy charge of the cell governs what the activation of that receptor will do. The cell itself is the receptor.

## Migraines, Thyroid, and Serotonin

**Caller:** I am taking Lexapro, Imitrex for migraines, and Synthroid for a thyroid condition. Are SSRIs a problem for the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are very closely connected. Hypothyroid people often have extremely high serotonin levels. The active thyroid hormone (T3) decreases the production and retention of serotonin. Serotonin, being inflammation-promoting and affecting blood vessels, is a major factor in migraines.

**Caller:** I also take Cytomel.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cytomel is T3. It is a good anti-serotonin agent. With the right amount, it is effective against migraines. My own interest in endocrinology started with my migraines. I found it was an interaction between intestinal inflammation—where 95% of serotonin is made—and low thyroid function. Hypothyroidism plus a sensitive intestine causes periodic flooding of the system with serotonin.

**Caller:** Is there a problem combining Lexapro, Imitrex, Synthroid, and Cytomel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a blood test for serotonin that more people should check; it is more meaningful than urine tests. The long-range effects of excess serotonin exposure are similar to chronic radiation or estrogen exposure—fibrosis of tissues.

## Conclusion and Nutritional Summary

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We have to end the calls there. Dr. Peat talked about starches in corn syrup irritating the intestine and increasing serotonin. One way to protect ourselves from radiation and increased serotonin is to replace starches—grains, beans, and starchy vegetables—with soft, ripe, juicy fruits. Also, keep thyroid function high with coconut oil (up to three tablespoons a day), plenty of calcium from local dairy, and good fruit sugars.
