## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor, the November 19th, 2021 edition. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show, Ask Your Herb Doctor.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never heard the show before, it runs every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 p.m. We have a live call-in from 7:30 until the close of the show. People are invited to call in with any questions related to the topic that we're discussing.

As has become very customary now, Dr. Peat is our guest and joining us to share his knowledge. Last month, we opened up a discussion which we couldn't finish, concerning metabolic defects in cancer and alternative approaches to cancer. Dr. Peat has for 35-40 years been researching and working in alternative medicine, approaches to physiology, and has a website with a wealth of information that we'll be giving out towards the end of the show. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for giving your time again this month. Would you just let people know more about you from an academic research perspective, and then we can carry on the show?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the '60s, I was studying various subjects in the humanities, and I decided to go into biology to study the brain mainly. But when I got to graduate school in 1968, my interest went to aging and its influence on the metabolism of the reproductive process—how reproduction influences the general process of aging. And since then, I've been following up the same general topics: aging, stress, sickness, and especially how the reproductive hormones can accelerate or retard the process of aging.

## The Role of Fats in Cancer Metastasis

**Andrew Murray:** So in terms of a hormonal physiology for aging, that's been a specialism. Last month we opened up a discussion on alternative approaches to cancer with an emphasis on the metabolic defects, for which you have fairly set principles that you have uncovered over time.

We covered cellular mitochondrial activity and how that produces energy. We discussed the myth of sugar being cancer-promoting, which is fairly rife in the mainstream. You've dispelled that myth for sure. Then you mentioned neuroendocrine dysregulation, things like estrogen driving not only breast but other cancers, and then the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, where stress produces cortisol and through chronic stress, the immune system can suffer. This is all part and parcel of a weakened organism that does in some ways predispose to the lack of surveillance. The last thing I think we got to was looking at redox balancing and mentioning that flavonoids can be used to quench free radical damage.

I had some abstracts that got my interest. I know you're a big proponent of saturated fats and you do not at all adhere to polyunsaturates as being in any way healthy. Actually, very much destruction and inflammation is caused by them. The abstracts I was looking at were things like lipid peroxidation, and the byproducts of lipid oxidation have been shown to promote cancer. So the whole rationale of people using these omega-3s and 6s and fish oils as being "healthy" is absolutely not what you want to be using if you've got a cancer diagnosis, or even if you don't. How about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of the abstracts you're referring to I think mentioned that on a high fish oil diet, the metastasis was about 1,000 times worse than on a low-fat diet or even a fat-deficient diet. Just a huge difference from supplementing fish oil versus not having fat. We can make all of the unsaturated and saturated fats that we need from carbohydrates, so we don't really need any fats in the diet except for the pleasant taste and helping to absorb other nutrients. These abstracts in particular show the tremendous pro-metastatic effect of the fish oil fats.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw other references, particularly for liver metastases and cancer growth in the liver. The liver is one of the major organs blood flows through, and vascular-borne cancers that travel to different sites can certainly become picked up in the liver. The liver itself is a sinusoidal organ, like a sponge, a matrix of many capillaries and openings where cancers can settle and grow. The articles I saw said that these omega-3s, and I think the sixes were probably also implicated, promoted cancer metastasis to the liver. There was a direct causal relationship between these omega-3s and liver metastases.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you hear me okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this lipid peroxidation, or rancid fat—when we eat fat, it can go rancid if it's not saturated, and that's known as lipid peroxidation. That applies to not only the fish oils but also all the vegetable seed oils, right? Like canola and soy and all the vegetable oils.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The more highly unsaturated they are, the quicker they break down. And some of the oxidative breakdown is almost immediate. Just as soon as it gets absorbed from your intestine and shows up in your bloodstream, you can find the highly oxidized breakdown fragments of the polyunsaturated fats like fish oil.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did I hear you correctly stating that metastasis is 1,000 times worse on a fatty diet versus a non-fat diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of these studies found that the number and quantity of identifiable metastatic cancer was, in these cases, 1,000 times higher.

**Andrew Murray:** And this would again lead to... people that have talked about ketogenic diets, this is absolutely the last thing you want to be doing, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In the process of getting the ketogenic effect, it's basically starvation and stress that turns on the so-called ketone production. One of the major ketone bodies is actually not a ketone but an alcohol hydroxyl group. In the hydroxyl state, which is formed during the ketogenic diet, this becomes a reductant having effects similar to lactic acid, which is a trigger to shift oxidation towards the fermentation or the lactic acid metabolism typical of cancer.

Once anything interferes with your ability to oxidize glucose fully, that liberates any stored fatty acids you have in your tissues. In the ketogenic state, you are releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream, and all of the liberated free fatty acids that have been studied promote metastasis. It isn't just the extremely toxic fish oil type, but just the fact of being a fatty acid rather than a sugar.

Many years ago, someone named Randle noticed that if you increase the fat in your diet and it turns into free fatty acids, the free fatty acids block the particular enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, which lets us oxidize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. The free fatty acids directly activate the enzyme that knocks out our ability to oxidize glucose. So once you get ketogenic from some degree of starvation, you're poisoning your ability to fully oxidize glucose. That leaves it producing lactic acid. When the pyruvate dehydrogenase is poisoned by various things, but especially free fatty acids, then you shift over to the cancer metabolism, producing lactic acid, which shifts the metabolism of other cells in the same direction.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So would that apply to saturated fat, but at a lesser extent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in some cases, certain saturated fats don't do that at all. But on average, whenever it's been studied, the Randle effect works as soon as our glucose oxidation is interfered with by rising free fatty acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this isn't really alternative medicine because this is scientifically backed and researched information that Dr. Peat is sharing with us tonight. It might not be applied in orthodox medical treatment of cancer, but this is in no way on the fringe of science. This is scientific information.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It actually represents more than 60 years investigating what is actually happening in the metabolism of stress and cancer. The whole thing that has developed in the last 50 years of saying that cancer lives on sugar, therefore, if you stop eating sugar, you'll starve cancer—that's absolutely 100% wrong. Sugar starvation causes the Randle cycle to take effect, blocking your ability to oxidize sugar fully. So you ferment it, producing lactic acid, which promotes more of the cancer metabolism, creates inflammation, and brings up the cortisol stress hormones that break down proteins to make more glucose or amino acids which will feed the cancer. The fatty acids themselves are good food for the cancer, but at a certain point of wasting away from cancer, fatty acids aren't very abundant in the body. The lactic acid metabolism is maintained by turning body proteins into glucose and amino acids to support the lactic acid metabolism of cancer.

## Recommended Diet for Cancer Patients

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in general, when you consult with people that might have cancer, would you recommend them to eat a non-fat or very low-fat diet and a very high sucrose and fructose diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Carbohydrates in general, especially sucrose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which is sugar, folks. And honey and sugar are chemically identical.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it was last month I mentioned the grape diet. It was famous in the '40s and '50s. It was a very high glucose and sucrose diet combined with a very high intake of the anti-inflammatory flavonoids. But those are two of the very important anti-cancer agents: the anti-inflammatory component of the diet that you get in fruits and vegetables, and then the abundance of the minerals and other nutrients of fruit, but an abundance of sucrose so that you don't resort to any tendency to liberate fatty acids.

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD. Callers are welcome to call in with questions related to this month's continuing topic, cancer and cancer alternatives. The number is 707-923-3911.

## The Interstitium and Lymphatic Health

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I wanted to question you about something that from a herbal medicine perspective is very important as an anti-cancer strategy: recognizing the actual function and value of the lymphatics. I know in breast cancer, lymph nodes obviously become congested. They pick up cancer cells, they are treating them; they are primarily white cells, surveillance sites with other killer cells, doing routine surveillance of all the fluids that are constantly passing through them.

But I wanted to get to the point of a new organ that science uncovered a few years ago. I think I read it in a science magazine maybe two or three years ago. It was because of a laser-type treatment of endoscopy that previously, when they had fixed tissue to look at microscopically, they saw that these collagen sheets and bundles looked fairly flattened and solid. But when they used these lasers, they saw that these were structural cavities filled with fluid. They call this material, this ground substance, the interstitium. And they now say that this interstitium is a fifth organ and primarily one of the largest organs in the body. But it's responsible, obviously, for the metastases of cancer cells.

In herbal medicine, the principal herb that I think of is poke root. It's been traditionally used for breast cancer as well as other cancers. It certainly has lymphatic, immunostimulant, and anti-inflammatory activity. It's been in the herbal pharmacopoeia for many years in the treatment of cancers, specifically for lymphatic cancers and breast cancers. What do you understand about the interstitium and this so-called ground substance through which I think some of these compounds are having their activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Structures have been identified within this previously thought-to-be amorphous extravascular system. A Korean named Bong-Han Kim, I think it was in the 1960s, called it the third circulatory system. What are now known as the exosomes—a large number of these small vesicles secreted by cells—are transported outside the blood vessels. Many of them flow through apparent channels in the extracellular material that seem to be almost specific for carrying the microvesicles or exosomes from a cell under stress to a cell which is, for example, in the bone marrow that can produce repair factors and send it back through the various circulatory systems—lymphatic, the extra-lymphatic one identified by the Korean, or via the bloodstream itself—to either correct a tumor or in some cases make it worse, depending on the state of the organism.

**Engineer:** And we have a couple of callers.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, we're good. Let's hold that there. We just got into the subject of connective tissue health, but let's take this first caller.

## Caller: Flax Oil and Avocados

**Engineer:** It was a local person who was a very bad connection, but they wanted to know what you thought of flax oil and what you thought of avocados.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avocados are a good enough, very pleasant, nutritious food, but you don't want to eat very large quantities on a regular basis just because there is some polyunsaturated fat in it. The flax oil is also very highly polyunsaturated. The flax meal has a bulk laxative action, so the flax meal can be protective and anti-cancer, but you don't want to build up a reserve of the polyunsaturated fats found in flax oil.

## Caller: Frankincense and Zeolite

**Caller:** I just wanted to say I have two miraculous stories. I'll start with my own. Quickly, I developed a chest cancer. I knew it was cancer because it feels like a little needle inside of your chest. I knew exactly what to do. I had ordered from an essential oil company a product called frankincense. I opened up the bottle and I liberally put it on my chest. Four hours later, the pain stopped, and I know I had killed the cancer. I just absolutely bathed it in the frankincense. It didn't return ever. It's been 10 years now.

The other was my sister. The doctors at UCSF said, "You have a cancer." She was very upset. I said, "Look, I had used frankincense prior to this time to kill a cancer, start that program." So I went down and I got her 3 or 4 ounces of frankincense. She started doing that. She also used it internally before. As long as you don't use too much—and we're all different—I was also taking it internally for a while, mixing it with some sort of water or juice, and that seems to have cleansed out my system as well.

She started on the program of using the frankincense topically. She said she had a cyst on the front of her body and started using it. About three months later, that little cyst fell out onto her finger. She was quite astonished. But the other thing that she was using was something called zeolite, Z-E-O-L-I-T-E, I believe. She said that it was taking the heavy metals out of the body and excreting them. She has been a person that's eaten organically her whole life. She is intolerant, cannot take calcium through dairy products, and she's a vegetarian. What do you think of those two things?

**Andrew Murray:** Right, okay. Well, I'm glad you mentioned frankincense. Its name is *Boswellia sacra*, and I was going to mention it as one of many herbs that have been used for cancer, specifically for skin cancers. So boswellia is one we were going to mention. And then the zeolite sounds like a chelating agent. Dr. Peat, do you know much about zeolite and its use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Frankincense and myrrh contain a variety of triterpenes that are structured similarly to the steroids. They haven't actually been studied enough to define exactly how their anti-cancer effect works.

## Improving Connective Tissue

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, just getting back to the herbal medicine perspective of improving and strengthening the connective tissue. The interstitium is a highway through which fluids move and can either be picked up in the lymphatics—if they are things like bacteria or fungal spores—and trapped and dealt with. Cancer is also able to use this same highway to be taken to distant sites. But there definitely is a rationale for improving the connective tissue itself, as cancer cells locally break down and invade adjacent tissues in their quest for access to the vasculature or lymphatics.

What do you think about agents that we're familiar with? Things like horsetail, a rich source of silica, or phytolacca and its main components that have this lymphatic immune-stimulating activity? What do you see as a value in improving and toning the tissues? I know you mentioned a lot about calcium, and calcium is part and parcel of improving the extracellular matrix.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The role of calcium is very closely related to energy metabolism and inflammation. When you're deficient in energy, you activate many of the pro-inflammatory peptides and small lipid molecules. In an ideal situation, that momentary increase of inflammation can reactivate repair processes, especially for the connective tissue. But getting the energy and essential nutrients provided is going to have an anti-inflammatory effect which allows the energy production to take effect and maintain structural integrity. The effect of adequate calcium in your diet is to oppose the excitatory effects of too much phosphate in your diet. So the calcium is having an anti-inflammatory, pro-energy restoration effect, and that has the effect of maintaining structural integrity of the interstitium, the whole structural framework that holds cells together.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Not only anti-cancer, but you're mentioning the benefits it has on maintaining healthy connective tissue as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, keeping inflammation down and energy up.

## Caller: Bladder Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this next caller. Caller, where are you from? What's your question?

**Caller:** Hi, I'm from Garberville and I had a low-grade bladder cancer. It came back again and they just take it out. But I was wondering if you had any recommendations. I'll take my answer on the air.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, Dr. Peat, low-grade bladder cancer. What would you suggest as good approaches? Obviously everything that we had previously talked about, but go ahead and speak to that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been several people who developed effective treatments by infusing a mixture of nutrients—vitamin A-related things, proteolytic enzymes, and stabilizing anti-inflammatory things such as lidocaine—into the bladder and then arranging the person's posture so that the mixture is in contact with the actual tumor itself. You can get a very, very high concentration on the tumor, and several of those procedures have been very effective at removing persistent bladder tumors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Okay, so let me just repeat that to make sure that we heard you correctly. You said there's been research done to show that an infusion of proteolytic enzymes, vitamin A compounds, and lidocaine, infused with the person laying down in such a way that it contacts the tumor? Is that what you mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I'm not sure if that was a complete list of the ingredients, but two or three groups were using very similar groups with a very high cure rate.

**Engineer:** And what is infusion in this context? Are you putting that up through the urethra or are you drinking it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Filling the bladder with a mixture, half-filling it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you also said anti-inflammatory things, so maybe like aspirin? Would they have infused aspirin into the bladder?

**Andrew Murray:** Would they have used something like aspirin as well as an anti-inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always recommend aspirin for any cancer. It reduces inflammation, helps to restore the energy level, and has at least a dozen effects that help to control or eliminate cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I would like to put the warning out there that if people are choosing to use aspirin for treating their own cancers, you should really call us and we'll give you the instructions on how to take aspirin safely in conjunction with vitamin K2. It's very important if you're taking more than a baby aspirin a day that you take vitamin K2 to prevent bleeding. If anyone wants to use more than a baby aspirin a day, then email us or call us at our number, which is Western Botanical Medicine, 707-986-9506. Our email is either andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com or sarah@westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

## Anticoagulants and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, talking about the coagulopathy that happens with cancer—even if it's not stimulated by estrogen, which promotes blood thickening and clotting—the approach to treatment as an anticoagulopathy treatment, in terms of making the platelets less sticky and making blood flow more easily. Do you think this would have a good rational basis in science for using things like aspirin, garlic, and ginkgo that have traditional use for improving blood flow and preventing clotting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The clotting system and the platelets are very central to the ability of metastatic cells to get across the blood vessel into the area it's going to colonize. Various things that decrease the stickiness and the tendency to coagulate of the platelets have been studied and very strongly discourage metastatic spread and so increase the survival rate. Lidocaine, aspirin, and progesterone are just three of the factors that have been over and over demonstrated to interfere with the metastatic stickiness and ability to travel in the cancer cells. It makes them stay home and not hurt anything.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Stay home cancer, stay home.

## The Concept of "Watchful Waiting"

**Andrew Murray:** My next question is about anti-angiogenic activity to manage cancer, a little bit like diabetes, because diabetes has been implicated in the breakdown of vascular walls.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were studies in the '40s and '50s showing that the longer people left their cancer untreated, the longer they lived. Several studies have looked at the statistics on the population in general showing that in some cancers, the survival rate stays the same no matter how much you do to the patient. But in some cases, the more you treat, the higher the death rate is. That was first seen distinctly in the case of prostate cancer in the early '90s. By the end of the century, this had impressed enough prostate specialists that they came up with the idea of "watchful waiting," figuring that if you don't use any of the harmful treatments, such as high-dose estrogen, and just watch what's happening, the normal aging process happens faster than the development of a normal old man's prostate cancer. That's a well-established concept now that watchful waiting has actually improved the mortality rate from cancer—failing to treat it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What's that statistic you quote, Dr. Peat? That 99.9% of people over the age of 50 have some form of abdominal cancer that 99.9% of people will not die of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an autopsy, you can find cancer in essentially 100% of the people over 50 if you look for it. It's part of a natural healing process, and most people just coexist with many of these little cancers that aren't really hurting anything.

**Andrew Murray:** On a very quick side note, I had a keratosis on the side of my nose. I spoke to you about this, Dr. Peat, three or four years ago. I had it for two years. It obviously wasn't healthy cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In your latest photograph, your nose looks fine. No defect at all.

**Andrew Murray:** I just wanted to tell people that I had it. I did have a biopsy done and it identified it as basal cell carcinoma. Of course, they wanted to do everything with it, which I refused. I went ahead and did what you suggested I do. I don't have it anymore. Folks, it's possible.

## Conclusion

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before we end, I want to mention a book that I think might be the most important book published in the last two or three years. It's Robert Kennedy Jr.'s *The Real Anthony Fauci*. It gives us a background for not only the COVID-19 process but the background going back decades.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, well, he's been there for 40 years or something. Dr. Fauci is pretty entrenched.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but this book I think is going to change that.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, they said that possibly he's perjured himself. Anyway, thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat. It's five to the hour and we need to give people your information. So thanks so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. Good night.

**Andrew Murray:** For those people who've listened to the show before or who just tuned in, Dr. Raymond Peat has a wealth of experience. He's been doing this for over 40 years. He's written several books and published hundreds of articles. His website is raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com. His journal articles there are well-referenced. He's a very scientific person.
