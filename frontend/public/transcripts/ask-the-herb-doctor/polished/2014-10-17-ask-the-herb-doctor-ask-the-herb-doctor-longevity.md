## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. I'm a licensed medical herbalist. Every third Friday of the month, we have a topic that we choose to open up, and once again, I'm very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat share his wisdom and expertise. At the end of the show, listeners are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of longevity.

Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. I know that a lot of your background has been involved with reproductive physiology and aging. As always, I would ask you to introduce yourself and your professional and academic background for people who have perhaps never listened to you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started getting interested in aging in childhood. Through the 1950s, when I would mention it to people, a few of the very old people—like a biology professor who studied around the turn of the century—had some interesting ideas about the actual cause of aging that suggested possibilities for preventing it. But most people in the 1950s weren't at all interested in the idea of curing aging; it was inconceivable that anything could be done about it.

When I decided to go to graduate school in biology from 1968 to 1972 at the University of Oregon, I intended to study brain biology. It happened that there were some good people working on reproductive aging, so I did my dissertation on female reproductive aging. That helped to answer some questions that I had been accumulating for 20 years, but it really just opened up a lot of basic biological questions regarding the whole nature of what an organism is and how it develops through time.

The whole process used to be explained as reading out from a pre-established blueprint in the genes. That led to the idea that there must be genes causing aging and death. Rethinking that whole developmental scheme is necessary. If you see development as epigenetic, or open to interaction with the environment, then aging obviously is another epigenetic, environmentally dependent process.

## The Biology of Aging and DNA Repair

**Andrew Murray:** I appreciate you bringing out different perspectives on previously held scientific facts. Regarding longevity, I read a recent study published by the University of Wisconsin in the journal *eLife*. They subjected a strain of *E. coli* bacteria to normally lethal doses of radiation. They took the survivors, reproduced them, and doubled the dose until, 20 generations later, they had a colony able to withstand 1,000 times the lethal radiation dose for a human. They were looking at DNA repair as a primary objective in facilitating longevity. What do you think about the protection of DNA in our body as a method of sustaining longer life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there is a parallel between what the bacteria are doing and what happens to humans exposed to stresses like radiation. However, single-celled organisms are essentially different in how they respond to stress. Twenty generations of bacteria would be just a few days, so they couldn't possibly be evolving new DNA sequences to make new functional proteins in such a short time.

The radiation degrades proteins, so it tends to knock out functions when it damages the DNA. The bacteria that died had their DNA so damaged they lost function. The ones that survived simply didn't lose the function, but their defense processes were activated. With each generation, they were getting an intensification of the defense reactions.

Bacteria, yeasts, and protozoa under stress can either decide to reproduce faster—live more intensely and divide more quickly if their genes are still working—or they can go in the direction of dehydration. For radiation, forming a spore and eliminating water makes the DNA very resistant because water is part of the hydroxyl radical that destroys the DNA. Without water tied to the DNA, it is very resistant.

**Andrew Murray:** So that's why spores can live for so long in the desert.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If humans tried to do that, the cells under stress would either multiply very rapidly—which would be a cancer—or they would go into something worse than hibernation, simply drying up into a suspended, mummy-like existence. It just doesn't work for humans.

We have ways of handling damaged genes. What animals do is kill the whole cell when the organism senses that the DNA has been damaged beyond the capacity to repair it. To avoid forming a cancer, they have to let the damaged ones die—a sort of triage. The quicker it can die, the more material is available for cancer-stimulating stem cells to replace it.

I think a major factor in aging is that things interfere with that whole process of either repairing or letting the cells die quickly to be replaced. In old age, the process of cell death is retarded. Cells become old, they can't decide what to do, and so they slow down. The whole organism metabolically slows down. In that slowing down process, they produce undesirable products like lactic acid that cause problems for the whole organism instead of just dying and getting it over with.

**Andrew Murray:** So you're saying that the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is actually slowed down in normal human aging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. People are now looking for the factors that retard that quick replacement, quick apoptosis, and activation of stem cells.

## NAD, Energy, and Sirtuins

**Andrew Murray:** Moving onto energy. There is a compound called NAD and another form, NADH, which are very important for energy conveyance. The *E. coli* article mentioned NAD as a target therapy. How important do you see NAD supplements being in our biological systems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Our cells are constantly in a process of oxidizing. Electrons from things like sugar go to the oxidizing NAD and reduce it so that it becomes NADH. NADH can then pass those electrons on eventually to oxygen. In normal metabolism, you should have 300 to 500 times as much NAD as NADH because it's in a rapidly oxidizing state. Stresses that interfere with oxygen or subtract the NAD cause a failure of the balance, shifting it to a very reduced, NADH-dominant state.

**Andrew Murray:** So stress depletes NAD?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depletes both of them. One thing that depletes them is damage to the DNA, such as radiation. In repairing DNA breaks, enzymes build up a chain of repetitive bases to plug the hole in the DNA. To repair the chain, ADP is attached, which comes from the supply of NAD. When you get a nick in the DNA, you draw down this huge amount of NAD to repair the damage. If you draw it down repairing too many broken DNAs, that interferes with the energy production of the cell. If you have ways to block those enzymes and stop the DNA repair, then the cell can make the decision to die, becoming raw materials for the stem cells.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there anything that would preempt that destructive phase rather than wasting energy trying to repair damaged chromosomes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there are drugs that block that enzyme, which is called PARP. PARP-inhibiting enzymes can save cells from dying unnecessarily or let them go ahead and die. Niacinamide happens to be a very safe way to inhibit that enzyme. At the same time, it is the precursor for making NAD, so you're plugging the drain and filling up the tank at the same time. We can normally make that from proteins—converting tryptophan to niacin—but if we're deficient in protein or have a vitamin deficiency blocking that conversion, we can't keep the NAD supply adequate.

**Andrew Murray:** The article also mentioned compounds called Sirtuins (SIRT1 and SIRT3) as a factor to improve longevity. What is your opinion of calorie restriction as a way of activating the Sirtuins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In calorie restriction, the organism has to do something to survive, so it starts shutting down and turning off genes. The initials stand for Silent Information Regulators. In yeasts, starvation or stress will turn those on and turn off genes. A group at Harvard argued that longevity in yeast corresponded to long life in humans. They argued that resveratrol, which is chemically very closely related to DES (diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen), stimulated this. Resveratrol is found in grapes and has estrogenic activity. Yeasts are especially sensitive to estrogen.

In humans, that process of turning off genes moves toward a spore-like or hibernating state of not producing proteins. Two very important proteins that get turned off by the Sirtuins include Klotho—a phosphate-regulating protein where turning it off causes rapid aging—and p53, which is a tumor suppressor protein. You definitely don't want to blindly turn off proteins in defense.

**Andrew Murray:** So you don't want to just shut down and turn your anti-tumor proteins off.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. Several years ago, the Harvard group said we shouldn't supplement niacinamide because it suppresses Sirtuins. They claimed if Sirtuins are the "long life proteins," niacinamide would accelerate aging. However, someone put human cells in a dish, gave them a supplement of niacinamide, and they lived 60% longer.

## Protein, Kidneys, and Ammonia

**Caller (New Jersey):** I understand the importance of consuming high-quality proteins, but there is one exception: the kidneys. You've said in your "Gelatin, Stress, and Longevity" article that if the kidneys are working, glycine is non-toxic, but any amino acid will contribute to the production of ammonia. Is there a way to judge if we are getting enough amino acids without stressing the kidneys?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Normal functioning kidneys aren't stressed by a high-protein diet. However, when something is impairing kidney function, such as hypothyroidism or other sickness, then with low kidney function and bacteria in your intestine breaking down amino acids, you can get accumulated ammonia.

Researchers proposed using ketoacids equivalent to the essential amino acids. These will absorb the ammonia even when a person has no functioning kidney ability to secrete ammonia. By feeding ketoacids, you create protein in your body by absorbing the ammonia from your blood. We did chromatography on potato juice and found that potatoes are rich in these ketoacids, which will function as amino acids even though they contain no ammonia.

**Caller (New Jersey):** So for someone with sore kidneys, would you recommend potato juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few people who had ammonia on their breath every time they ate protein found that just a couple of meals of potato juice allowed them to start assimilating proteins. Ordinarily, there are many other things you need to do when you have kidney disease. You want to correct all the hormones involved in regulating kidney physiology, especially thyroid, progesterone, estrogen, cortisol, and pituitary stress hormones.

**Caller (New Jersey):** And keep eating the raw carrot daily to keep the ammonia down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that helps with the bacterial ammonia production.

## Fats vs. Sugars and Teeth Grinding

**Caller (Chris, Colorado):** In terms of longevity, I understand the importance of avoiding unsaturated fats. However, regarding proper oxidative energy, how important is it to keep fats low and focus more on sugars like sucrose and lactose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A certain small amount of fat helps to stimulate the intestine and activate absorption of the oily vitamins (K, D, A, and E). About 30 or 40 years ago, I looked at the association of various fats with spontaneous cancer incidence. Coconut oil had the lowest of the natural oils. But someone found that hydrogenated coconut oil, containing zero polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), had the lowest incidence of all—essentially like a completely fat-free diet.

Even eating a moderate amount of butter and coconut oil, the 2% or 3% of polyunsaturated fats accumulate because our muscles quickly oxidize the saturated fats. We preferentially store the polyunsaturated fats. With age, our fat tissues become more concentrated with PUFA. Under stress, fat is released, and the PUFA is more accessible to stress activation. Since we can make all the saturated fats (palmitate, stearate) and desaturate stearic acid to make oleic acid, I think it's best to get as much sugar and starch in your diet—preferably sugars from fruit and milk—and minimize exposure to the unstable Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids.

**Caller (Chris, Colorado):** One off-topic question: My girlfriend grinds her teeth at night without noticing. Any ideas on the cause?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several publications show that high serotonin is probably the major factor in tooth grinding and restless leg syndrome.

**Andrew Murray:** What is the most straightforward way of lowering serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reducing intestinal inflammation is the quickest way. Low thyroid is a factor, but simply avoiding slowly digested foods like resistant starches or undercooked vegetables helps. Salads are very bad for irritating the intestine. Some soluble fibers, even pectin from fruit, can greatly increase the production of serotonin and disturb sleep.

## Chronic Fatigue and Metabolic Syndrome

**Caller (Graham, Los Angeles):** My wife has chronic fatigue. Do you have thoughts on how to deal with mitochondrial dysfunction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is basically the same stress syndrome: low thyroid, excess production of lactic acid, and high stress mediators like serotonin, histamine, and prolactin. Prolactin generally rises when thyroid goes down and serotonin goes up.

**Andrew Murray:** What would be your dietary suggestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things that are quickly digested. A raw carrot contains anti-inflammatory chemicals and antibiotics that suppress irritating bacteria and bind toxins. Just having a raw carrot every day can adjust hormones in a good direction.

**Caller (Graham, Los Angeles):** She finds the raw carrot hard to digest.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The point of eating the carrot is that it *isn't* digested, so it releases antiseptic chemicals and stimulates the intestine to carry out material. It acts like a bottle brush. If you shred it with a fine food processor so it's almost like hair, that is the most effective kind of fiber because you get a lot of surface area.

**Caller (Graham, Los Angeles):** I have trouble with Metabolic Syndrome—specifically removing belly fat despite exercise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Polyunsaturated fats are probably what set up that inability to oxidize sugar efficiently. It keeps free fatty acids in circulation, which block metabolism. An active form of thyroid containing T3 is the basic way to get metabolism going so you can oxidize glucose and turn off the free fatty acids.

**Andrew Murray:** How should he monitor this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keep track of your metabolic rate. Low thyroid people find that a lot of the water they drink comes back as urine, whereas you should be able to evaporate a couple of quarts of water a day. Other indicators are heart rate at rest and temperature. Temperature should rise to around 98.6°F right after breakfast and stay there until close to sunset.

## B Vitamin Supplementation

**Andrew Murray:** I know B vitamins are involved in energy generation. What is a good strategy to ensure adequate levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good diet that includes liver once in a while, milk, cheese, eggs, and seafood regularly. Seafood provides trace minerals you might not get in land foods.

**Andrew Murray:** How realistic is it for people to be low in B vitamins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** B vitamins act very quickly. With Vitamin B1 (thiamine), you can often feel an effect in the first hour. With Vitamin B6, you generally feel an effect in the first day; sometimes one dose of 10 milligrams will take care of a problem that has lingered for a long time.

**Andrew Murray:** What doses do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person has diabetes or cancer and very high lactic acid production, 300mg of B1 in divided doses can help normalize sugar metabolism. Ordinarily, 10 or 20 milligrams is plenty.

For B3 (Niacinamide), taking 50 or 100 milligrams several times a day can control symptoms of diabetes, arthritis, and degenerative problems. Doctors used to like nicotinic acid because it made people turn red, but that flushing releases serotonin, histamine, and toxic prostaglandins. The market is now flooded with "No Flush Niacin," but if you look at the label, it is inositol hexanicotinate. This is slow-release, so it doesn't cause sudden blushing, but it still releases those toxic substances. It has to be niacinamide.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned specifically for cancer, B1 doses of 200-300mg.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it stimulates the oxidation of lactic acid, producing more carbon dioxide. Lactic acid keeps cancer developing by creating inflammation.

## Body Temperature and Heavy Metals

**Caller (Laytonville):** I've always had a low body temp, around 97.4. Is that normal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. If you have consistently low body temperatures that do not rise after food, that suggests metabolic deficiency. Protein deficiency is a possible cause. I've seen people who couldn't respond to thyroid, and it turned out they were eating only 20 grams of protein a day when the requirement is closer to 80 grams.

**Caller (Laytonville):** What are your thoughts on chelation or heavy metal cleanses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good foods will safely activate the process of mobilizing heavy metals from the tissues and passing them out through the kidneys. Coffee drinkers are known to have a lower load of heavy metals like cadmium and lead. Orange juice and milk provide materials that help inactivate the toxic effect of heavy metals while mobilizing them.

## Viral Defense (Ebola)

**Andrew Murray:** Ebola virus is a careful watchword right now. What are your thoughts on how best to protect yourself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The effects are basically like the flu and many other infections that activate inflammatory processes. The first thing that happens is the inhibition of interferon—an antiviral defense—and the activation of nitric oxide production, which opens up blood vessels, makes them leaky, and lowers energy production.

Whether it's flu, Ebola, or chemical poisoning, the defense is to lower anything irritating, such as hard-to-digest foods, and lower inflammation and nitric oxide production. Aspirin, coffee, and niacinamide are all defenses against nitric oxide.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there anything to raise interferon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That will take care of itself if you keep your energy up and hold the inflammatory things, such as nitric oxide, as low as you can.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you very much, Dr. Peat, for joining us. For listeners who want more information, Dr. Peat's website has a wealth of fully referenced articles. The website is www.raypeat.com.
