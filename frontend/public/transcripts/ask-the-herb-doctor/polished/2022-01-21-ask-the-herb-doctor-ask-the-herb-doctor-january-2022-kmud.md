## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to the January 21, 2022 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show.

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. We are broadcasting nationwide and internationally to a wide range of open-minded, perceptive individuals who want to know what's really going on. Don't forget to listen to the audio archives. Our website has at least 10 years of archives.

**Michael:** I'd like to comment on the archive situation. They used to be held for a lot longer. Currently, they are up there for three months. There is a way that you can find a quick link to yours to put on your website, and we should talk to KMUD to try to get the longer archives back.

**Andrew Murray:** We record all of them, so they are intended to be put on the website. Tonight, we are discussing MSG and cancer, and continuing the topic of estrogen and its progressively destructive effects, including the induction of autoimmunity. We have a wrap-up from last month to finish, and then we will get started with MSG, glutamate, and the links to cancer and excitotoxicity. There is also a link to COVID and MSG through its negative effects on the immune system.

Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us again. For those who may never have heard you, could you let them know a little bit about your expertise?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been a student of the humanities, teaching painting and English literature. I got interested in language and how the brain can do such a thing as use language. I decided that the only way to make progress was to go to graduate school in biology and study the brain.

In 1968, I went back to the University of Oregon. I quickly found that the nerve biology section of the department was very dogmatic; they cared more about their theories than the actual experimental evidence. I checked into many different labs and found that the aging research in reproductive physiology was the most concerned with finding out what is really happening. I decided to do my dissertation on age-related oxidative changes in the hamster uterus, which I finished in 1972. Surprisingly, that had a huge amount of information relative to brain function. To understand what is going on in aging changes—and how the organism redesigns cells to start a new life from a single fertilized ovum—involves the same principles you need to look at to see what the brain is doing in relation to behavior and language. I've been working on those subjects ever since.

## Estrogen and Herbal Modulators

**Andrew Murray:** I really appreciate your interweaving of your artistic nature with a fluid understanding of biology. Before we move on, I wanted to cover a couple of things from an herbal perspective surrounding estrogen and aromatase.

Last month I mentioned a cucurbitaceous vine called *Momordica charantia*, or bitter melon. It has been used to block estrogen and has estrogen-modulating properties. It is also an anti-diabetic plant. I also wanted to mention Artemisinin, a component of wormwood (*Artemisia annua*). It contains anti-parasitic, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects, but it has also been shown to reduce the estrogen-receptive function in breast cancer cell lines.

Also, Tamoxifen may be useful in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, particularly those arising from aberrant helper T1 cell activity. However, the induced shift away from cellular immunity represents a significant step in fostering a cancerogenic environment. This may limit the anti-cancer effects of Tamoxifen and explain why it is inferior compared to other anti-estrogens for preventing disease recurrence.

## MSG, Obesity, and Excitotoxicity

**Andrew Murray:** Let's kick off with the topic of MSG. The FDA considers monosodium glutamate safe to add to food. It is one of the most abundantly found amino acids in nature, present in foods as a flavor enhancer (E621), hydrolyzed protein, or purified monosodium salt.

Early on, they were claiming benefits of MSG, such as increasing temperature, decreasing body mass, and decreasing fat tissue production. However, the negative effect of this glutamate was that it suppressed the oxidation of glucose. Dr. Peat, there are claims of obesity caused by MSG, whereas before they talked about it increasing metabolism. Can you explain the excitotoxic effects and why the FDA hasn't banned it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the weight loss claim was just a sales ploy to sell the flavoring substance. In the 1970s, J.W. Olney found that when rats were fed just a little more than the amount a person could normally eat, the brain was damaged in a way that led to lifelong obesity. It caused the destruction of enough of the brain that appetite remained out of control, and the metabolic rate wasn't sufficient to keep weight steady.

Over a period of several years, he did many experiments showing that the same sort of molecule—aspartic acid, aspartame, or variations acting through the glutamate or aspartate receptor—had this range of excitatory effects. One of the "positive" things was that it made you seem more alert, but that alertness came at the expense of not having enough energy produced to meet the high energy consumption caused by the excitatory action.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't aspartame the fake sugar, Splenda or NutraSweet?

**Michael:** NutraSweet is aspartic acid with methanol. It degrades into methanol and leaves methanol in your neurons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspartame is a super-sweet material, sweeter than saccharin, but the amount that is toxic is very small. They've demonstrated that it can cause brain cancer. Olney showed in the late 70s that the sudden appearance of a rising incidence of gliomas—malignant glial cell tumors—followed the introduction of foods loaded with aspartame and MSG by a few years. He demonstrated you could cause those tumors by overfeeding glutamate or MSG to animals.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This goes to show we can't trust the ethics of the FDA if they're allowing that product on the market.

## Cell Phones and Energy Depletion

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cell phones have shown a similar correspondence. If a person habitually holds their cell phone to the right ear, the incidence of brain tumors on the right side has increased sharply. It happens that they are both causes of excitotoxicity. The electromagnetic field excites the cells, and you need to provide energy to keep up with that, or the cell dies.

Ongoing experiments show that when cells are endangered by things like MSG or aspartame, giving them a super amount of sugar (glucose) will save the neurons simply by feeding whatever is needed to keep up with the high level of excitation.

This excitotoxic conflict—between unavoidable stimulation and something interfering with the oxidation of glucose—applies to aging, gliomas, and epilepsy. If the cells aren't able to keep up their energy production with the excitation, the seizure gets out of control and damages the tissue. Any cell that can be exaggeratedly stimulated can be rescued if you keep the sugar supply up. If it isn't kept up, that cell can become cancerous or die, leading to dementia or brain function loss.

**Andrew Murray:** This is like a kind of wasteful entropy. There's a lack of input of the energy needed to keep the cell going.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it's made worse by overlapping influences. It isn't just cell phone radiation, aspartame, and MSG; many different things have that same function.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So eating Chinese food with MSG, drinking a diet soda, and talking on your cell phone is a bad combination.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at what any stress does—vibration, laser, telephone overstimulation, glucose deprivation, or oxygen deprivation—they all turn out to be excitatory.

## Protective Mechanisms: Sugar, Serotonin, and Histamine

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It happens that feeding energy in the form of sugar has a sedative action that leads to turning down the degree of excitation.

If the cell perceives that it is not getting enough energy to meet its needs, one alternative is to go into hibernation. To do that, it has the equipment for producing serotonin. Serotonin helps prevent heat loss through the skin, but it also turns down the production of heat, leading to a colder state—suspended animation to a degree.

Another universal reaction is the formation of histamine. When a cell is in a desperate, dying condition, it secretes histamine to open up closed blood vessels and get more blood delivered.

Estrogen is another of these short-term emergency things. Estrogen can activate the serotonin system to cool off the energy-consuming apparatus, and it can activate the histamine system. It also activates nitric oxide formation and heme oxygenase. Heme oxygenase breaks down heme (used to make cell energy) to produce bilirubin and carbon monoxide. Under these circumstances, carbon monoxide serves as an antioxidant, blocking the ability to consume oxygen and moving the system into a torpor.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's lots of inflammation and wasteful mechanisms to deplete the organism of energy.

## Protein Consumption and Aging

**Michael:** My understanding is that glutamate stimulates the umami flavor, and a lot of high-protein nutritious foods stimulate that too. How is it that the body is benefited by eating a high-protein diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the natural state, protein is a rare delicacy for most animals. The urge to eat protein is a survival urge to build muscle and make new tissue. But when society provides lots of cheap protein, people get in the habit of eating it because it's there, rather than being guided by their appetite.

People tend to overeat protein after the age of 20. As long as you're growing, you respond to the signal action of glutamate and go into an anabolic state to make muscle and brain tissue. But once your size is established, if you keep eating that same amount, you have an excess beyond your needs. You get excess histidine, tryptophan, methionine, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamate—all of which are potentially excitotoxic amino acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you recommend people consume 75 to 100 grams of protein a day, you're not recommending they consume that all in the form of muscle meat or eggs. You typically don't recommend more than two eggs a day, and believe most protein should come from dairy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. After you're grown, you should try to learn to go by your actual biological urges rather than what advertising tells you to eat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How many ounces of muscle protein would you recommend as a safe level for adults?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As your metabolic rate slows down steadily from puberty, the older you are, the more careful you have to be about having an excess of the excitotoxic amino acids. Adelle Davis pointed out that gelatin is considered an incomplete protein, but she said she had seen lots of old women going for years living on a diet of toast, Jell-O, and tea—practically their only protein being gelatin. That was an illustration of what a very tiny amount a very old person needs.

## Sources of MSG and Neuroprotection

**Andrew Murray:** I pulled out an article describing the exposure of rats to MSG at the neonatal stage. It severely damaged their hypothalamic nuclei, resulting in increased body weight, fat deposition, and decreased growth hormone. MSG appears to be a suitable candidate for inducing obesity which leads to diabetes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wonder if it's allowed to be in products without being listed as an additive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think legally it has to be listed, but they have alternatives like calling it "vegetable broth" when it's really an MSG extracted from soybean.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about Tamari? That is fermented soy protein. Doesn't that form a natural MSG?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that should be limited in someone's diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an article stating that curcumin from turmeric protects against MSG neurotoxicity by decreasing the NMDA receptor 2B expression in the rat hippocampus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are lots of flavonoids like quercetin and myricetin in coffee. Coffee has lots of tissue-protective, anti-cancer, and anti-dementia effects that I think are largely an effect of the flavonoid components.

**Andrew Murray:** Another article mentioned that glutamate was involved in increasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), contributing to brain damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There has been a lot of study on how excitotoxic things like glutamate make the cell become more active. They found that the addition of extra glucose allowed the cell to extrude more calcium. Normally, responding to an excitotoxin means the cell takes up and retains calcium, leading to inflammation and cell death. Glucose promotes the increase of carbon dioxide formation. The carbon dioxide leaves the cell as carbonic acid, taking the calcium with it. This flow of glucose and carbonic acid out of the cell takes care of the calcium accumulation, which is the basic cause of the inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** Typical foods that are glutamate-rich include hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, yeast extracts, soy extracts, and protein isolates. These form a large part of vegetarian or vegan diets as alternative protein sources.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even organic bouillons often have yeast extract. I notice if I eat that, I feel like I've had an MSG burn on my tongue.

## Caller: Inflammation and Aging

**Caller:** I live on the Avenue of the Giants. Can you explain inflammation? Is it inflammation of the cells or around the muscle tissue, particularly regarding arthritis and the aches and pains of getting older?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People recently have been talking about "inflammaging," as if that explains something. The process of aging obviously involves increased inflammation. The problem is to see what the basic events are. Cell structure, pain, excitation, inflammation, and aging all have these aspects of cytotoxic cell damage and the inability to remedy the problem by making enough energy.

Regarding heme oxygenase, probably 95% of publications describe carbon monoxide as an antioxidant. But if you look at the deteriorated brain in old age, there is more carbon monoxide in it than at any previous life stage. Carbon monoxide presence is a degenerative aspect of inflammation. If you block the formation of carbon monoxide after a traumatic wound, you prevent most of the damage. The chemistry of aging and inflammation expresses the same idea as excitotoxicity and wasteful energy processes.

## Caller: Reversing Metabolic Damage

**Caller:** I'm from South Central Los Angeles. How long does the body take to heal from damage? If you reduce estrogen, PUFA, and inflammatory things, is there a difference in age regarding recovery time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A young person with a higher metabolic rate can change everything more quickly. If an average person moves from a country that eats a lot of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) to a country that eats very little, it can take four years to equilibrate to the new balance.

However, if you make an extreme effort—like one researcher who ate a laboratory purified diet absolutely lacking PUFA—his chronic health problems, like migraine, disappeared in about three or four months.

**Caller:** Would that apply to reducing estrogen for my wife, who suffers from fibroids and has had miscarriages?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A friend of mine who was 40 and wanted to get pregnant had a tennis-ball-sized fibroid blocking her uterus. She took a large dose of thyroid. Every month the doctor monitored it, and by the fifth month, it had become about a fourth of its original size, and she was pregnant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So five months made a big difference just by using natural thyroid hormone to lower estrogen and improve liver function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are so many other out-of-balance components of diet—too much iron, methionine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine. By fixing any one component, you can see drastic effects.

## Caller: Intestinal Bleeding in a Child

**Caller:** I'm from Arcata. My nine-year-old grandson has had two episodes of big intestinal bleeding. Scopes haven't found anything. Could you recommend any foods that would be soothing to the GI tract?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People vary in their sensitivities, but the first thing to do would be to absolutely avoid foods that have added gums, especially carrageenan. A very high percentage of foods now contain vegetable gums or microbial gums, all of which are very pro-inflammatory. Knocking out those foods can stop things like chronic bowel bleeding.

**Caller:** Would aloe vera or slippery elm be helpful?

**Andrew Murray:** In Europe, chamomile is the number one GI anti-inflammatory—"mother of the gut." Gentle tannins would also be indicated to gently astringe the capillaries.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That can be as simple as black tea or green tea.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very important to check his thyroid and vitamin D levels because a deficiency of either can make the intestine hypersensitive to inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** Also, check his hemoglobin. If he has had chronic bleeding, he might be anemic. Support that with foods containing naturally present iron, like liver, rather than iron supplements. As Dr. Peat mentioned, iron is very reactive and inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And avoid synthetic vitamin C. Synthetic vitamin C reacts with traces of iron in the body to produce inflammation.

## Caller: Dental Cavities

**Caller:** I'm from Queens, New York. What are the consequences of not filling a cavity? Is there damage to the nervous system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Consider if the damage is only into the enamel; that can be remineralized. But once it enters into the dentine, then it really needs to be filled.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We see a holistic dentist in Oregon who recommends Lugol's iodine for cavities that are just invading the enamel. Because it is close on the periodic table to fluoride, but not neurotoxic, it is a safe alternative for remineralizing superficial cavities.

**Michael:** I'll throw a plug out there for flossing. As one wise person said, "Floss only those teeth you wish to keep."

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** I want to mention a researcher named Blalock. In the *International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice and Research* (Jan 2021), there was an article titled "Excitotoxicity and Immuno-excitotoxicity as a Critical Component of the Cytokine Storm Reaction." It stated that the hyper-immune state during pulmonary viral infections was causative for cytokine storms. They found that co-injection of lipopolysaccharide plus an NMDA agonist (ibotenate from *Amanita muscaria*) caused significant neuronal damage.

I'll leave you with this thought: Nature is not accepting; through evolutionary pressure, it selects the fittest. Rules exist, like time, gravity, and death. Life demands that fitness be preserved and aims at physical and spiritual health. Resist authoritarianism and live.

Until the third Friday of next month, my name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Murray. Thank you for listening.
