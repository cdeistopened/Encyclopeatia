# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Inflammation, Serotonin, and Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. Dr. Raymond Peat joins us, as he has for several years now. Tonight, we are discussing the continuing topics of serotonin, inflammation, oxidants, and antioxidants. The number to reach us is 707-923-3911.

Dr. Peat, for those who have perhaps never heard you speak, would you outline your professional and academic background before we get into tonight's topic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got a Master's degree with a thesis on William Blake from the University of Oregon in 1960. I taught at various schools and colleges, and in 1968 went back for a PhD in biology at the University of Oregon, graduating in 1972. I have been following up on pretty much the same interests since the 50s, studying how the brain and body work.

## Tryptophan and Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** Carrying on from where we left off last month, I had some questions about tryptophan and serotonin. Given that serotonin is formed from the amino acid tryptophan, and the premise is that serotonin is an inflammatory molecule responsible for many negative effects, how best can we avoid tryptophan ingestion to limit the serotonin formed from it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tryptophan and its metabolites, including serotonin, are essential for life. Every kind of organism is built with proteins containing tryptophan. Albert Szent-Györgyi demonstrated the electronic nature of life—fluorescence, luminescence, and electronic conductivity of living systems. Tryptophan is the amino acid that gives proteins that basic property which, according to Szent-Györgyi, is the essential mechanism of life that lets it sense and move.

This electronic property is at the heart of sensation, movement, secretion, and consciousness. When something goes wrong with tryptophan or its metabolites, it disturbs life at its deepest level. Cell division and all other functions depend on this excitability of tryptophan.

In the muscle protein myosin, there is one particular tryptophan which is most sensitive electronically. This tryptophan interacts with cysteine, an oxidizable sulfur protein. These are the "electric motor" of life processes, and they are essential during the growth process. However, if you keep the same ratio coming in via your diet after you stop growing, they are no longer being consumed for growth. They become free actors which can spread excitability and oxidizability randomly in the organism.

During the growth period, you need the full balanced range of amino acids. But when growth stops, all you need is to maintain the renewal of skin, intestine lining, lungs, and brain proteins. That is a very small amount of growth compared to infancy. Those amino acids are now at risk of becoming random, excitatory, inflammation-promoting processes.

Gelatin is a major protein used for building connective tissues, and it has a complete lack of these excitable proteins: cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan. If gelatin becomes a major dietary protein when growth is completed, you reduce the risk of inflammatory and degenerative diseases.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think this could be mitigated through exercise? I know you don't promote stress-inducing aerobic exercise, but I come from a bodybuilding perspective where lightweight bearing exercise is supportive for muscle mass and thyroid stimulation. If someone is doing work, does that warrant a diet containing those amino acids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By the age of 30 or 40, when growth is completed, the bulk of our energy is spent just maintaining the body. But it has to function to be maintained. If you have a cast on your arm, muscles will atrophy because they aren't being used. So, just to maintain what we have, we have to be active. That includes mental or spiritual activity and keeping a freshness of perspective.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there is a place for people to actively engage in environmental enrichment to produce a mind-body state that is supportive rather than degenerative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It always has to involve newness and invention. Even conversations can be relatively athletic.

## Protein Sources: Meat vs. Plants

**Andrew Murray:** You have always mentioned that tryptophan should be balanced, which is why you recommend gelatin-rich products. Muscle meats are where we get the greatest proportion of tryptophan. I watched a documentary about plant-based athletes, specifically regarding an MMA fighter, McGregor. They claimed that meat consumption slowed the organism down and prevented muscles from repolarizing and repairing quickly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The high phosphate content relative to calcium in meat is a big part of that. It wastes energy. It acts like a constant subliminal stimulus that tends to load the cells up with calcium as if they were fatigued already.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you be supportive of a plant-based protein diet over meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The problem is that a lot of plant-based proteins are either overloaded with phosphate, the same as meat, or they have potential allergens and defensive molecules that plants have but animals do not.

**Andrew Murray:** So you still advocate very simple amino acid types—gelatin protein sources, dairy, cheese, milk, and eggs—as good quality, clean proteins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but it is a tremendously important field for research to find what plants have the proper nutrients and don't have the toxins.

**Andrew Murray:** Most proteins contain tryptophan. Do you think it's possible to obtain enough non-tryptophan containing proteins for continued muscle growth and repair?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the proteins other than gelatin that I know of will support proper growth and repair.

## Blood pH and CO2

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about the pH of the blood. It is kept very tightly between 7.35 and 7.45. Is it possible for this to change?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yes. I've seen very sick people with extremely high blood pH—7.5 or 7.6, for example. A person has to get really sick for the blood to change outside that range. You can do it momentarily just by hyperventilating—breathing so fast that your carbon dioxide is lost. That can push your blood pH very high to the point that you might faint or die. When you lose too much CO2, the increased pH tends to cause spasms, including blood vessel spasms, cutting off the circulation to your brain.

**Andrew Murray:** Can you do the opposite of that? I know you are an advocate of increasing CO2.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, rebreathing in a paper bag can correct that and lower the pH of your blood to the point that it can start weakening your muscles and causing too much vasodilation. Muscle weakness is the worst thing that happens in that direction.

## Statins and Brain Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** I want to talk about statins. The brain creates its own cholesterol, and generally, cholesterol is too big a molecule to get across the blood-brain barrier. However, statins do pass into the blood-brain barrier.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I imagine what they do to the brain is what they do to the muscles. If you are soaked in statins and do vigorous exercise, the interference with cholesterol can cause your muscle to break down and simply dissolve. I'm afraid that same thing can happen in the brain, accounting for depression and suicidality.

**Andrew Murray:** Since the brain is an energy-hungry organ and the white matter is principally cholesterol, lowering brain cholesterol is a cause for concern.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The old brain is sort of like a clump of atherosclerosis. It has lots of cholesterol, but it is bound to fatty acids. In the old brain, free cholesterol is actually lower than in the young brain. It is the bound-up, interfering type of cholesterol that accumulates in the aged brain, as in the aged blood vessels. Avoiding vegetable oils helps prevent that.

## Caller: Hair Analysis and Hypoglycemia

**Caller (Santa Barbara):** I just had a hair tissue mineral analysis test. My sodium to potassium ratio is very high—sodium is 34 and potassium is 1. What could be causing that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you have hard water or a water softener?

**Caller (Santa Barbara):** Yes, I have a water softener.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That puts sodium into the water, so it will skew the hair test.

**Caller (Santa Barbara):** My calcium to potassium ratio is also skewed. Calcium is 46 and potassium is 1.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That could be from hard water. I wouldn't worry about a hair mineral test; a serum test is much more useful.

**Caller (Santa Barbara):** I'm 46 years old. A couple of years ago, I started having symptoms of hypoglycemia, which I still have. I've gained about 40 pounds, have anxiety, high inflammation markers, and high cortisol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D, calcium, and thyroid are likely involved. The amount of calcium in your diet works with both thyroid and vitamin D to keep your metabolic rate up and your blood sugar steady. Two grams a day of calcium is a good level.

**Caller (Santa Barbara):** I drink about 16 ounces of 2% milk.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think twice that much of 1% would be better. Two quarts of skim or 1% helps to lose weight because of the high calcium content. That tends to increase your temperature. If your temperature doesn't rise to 98.6°F by half an hour after breakfast, then you likely need a thyroid supplement too.

**Caller (Santa Barbara):** I tried Nature-Throid, but I started having increased anxiety and aggressive behavior, so I quit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the effects of thyroid is to make your cells able to retain the magnesium that they need. If your diet doesn't have enough magnesium—and two quarts of milk would give you a generous supply—the thyroid cannot work properly. The normal function of thyroid is to increase your ability to relax both muscles and nerves.

## Caller: Osteoporosis

**Caller (Mendocino):** I'm 62 and was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. I went through menopause early at 45. What is an alternative way to treat that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping the parathyroid hormone under control is essential. Eating a lot of calcium—like two quarts of milk—and keeping your vitamin D serum level up to the middle of the range, around 50 ng/mL, is a good basis.

If your thyroid hormone is low, your prolactin will likely be high. Prolactin has a bone-weakening effect. It normally takes calcium out of the bone to put into milk, but under stress, it causes calcium loss. Prolactin tends to rise along with TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). The simplest way to normalize prolactin is to normalize your thyroid function.

**Caller (Mendocino):** I do not like milk. Is there something else I could do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cooked greens are the food richest in calcium relative to phosphate, other than milk. If you grind up eggshells, that is a good pure form of calcium carbonate. A couple of grams a day would be good.

**Andrew Murray:** If you use organic eggs, wash out the membrane, bake them at 150°F to sterilize them, and grind them into a fine powder. About an eighth of a teaspoon is roughly 650 milligrams.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Unopposed cortisol is another bone-dissolving hormone. If cortisol is high and not balanced with adrenal DHEA and progesterone, that contributes to osteoporosis. Supplementing progesterone, DHEA, and/or pregnenolone can oppose that effect.

## Cholesterol and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** I'm seeing reports now that the LDL/HDL distinction is a myth, and that oxidized LDL particles are responsible for the initial insult on the endothelium, which causes cholesterol to be laid down as a repair mechanism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** And regarding the brain, low cholesterol is rarely discussed, but you have said people should be around 200 mg/dL.

## Caller: Rising PSA Levels

**Caller (John):** I am 78. Over the last year, my PSA has gone up precipitously from 4 to 20. Are there supplements to drive that down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything anti-inflammatory is the right approach. A diet low in phosphate is basic. Cooked greens, cheese, milk, and eggs are anti-inflammatory foods. Keeping your thyroid function up so that your liver helps balance your hormones and keeps estrogen down is important. Adequate protein, a good calcium-phosphate ratio, and a fairly high-normal body temperature are important to lower inflammation and keep estrogen low.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think herbal aromatase inhibitors like nettle root or saw palmetto work by being anti-estrogenic? Is prostatic hypertrophy due to estrogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, estrogen is a growth and carcinogenic factor in the prostate. The men who live the longest with prostate cancer have the highest testosterone.

**Andrew Murray:** So testosterone is protective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the early 90s, when they started using the PSA test as a diagnosis, mortality from prostate cancer took a huge surge upward. Some doctors decided maybe it wasn't a good idea to diagnose it so aggressively. A couple of studies found that 100% of people who died at the age of 50 or more had diagnosable cancer somehow, even if they died of other causes.

**Andrew Murray:** Aspirin is also well-tolerated and anti-inflammatory.

## Caller: SSRI Withdrawal

**Caller (Redway):** How can I get off Celexa? I've been using it for many years.

**Andrew Murray:** We discussed this last month. Dr. Peat mentioned supporting the physiology with thyroid and lifestyle changes to allow a person to taper off.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the effects of SSRIs is that they tend to increase stress hormones. So, an anti-stress program is key. I've known people to withdraw from several different addictive things, including SSRIs, using progesterone, coffee, thyroid, and a good high-calcium diet.

**Andrew Murray:** Also, consider light exposure. With winter coming, seasonal affective disorder is common as thyroid gets low. Exposure to bright light and opposing estrogen with progesterone can have a beneficial effect.
