## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbs, supplements, and nutritional counseling.

Tonight, you are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject of nitric oxide, nitrates, nitrites, fluoride, and other components in the food chain that are decreasing fertility. Before I get into the topic, starting with fluoride, I'd like to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat for giving his time so freely to join us. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. As always, I want to give you the opportunity to outline your academic and professional background.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From 1968 to 1972, I studied biology, physiology, and biochemistry at the University of Oregon for a PhD. Before that, I was in linguistics, literature, and painting. Since then, I've been writing newsletters and doing consulting.

**Andrew Murray:** Your background is very much focused on the energetic state of the organism. I know that a lot of your research regarding hormones related to fertility, productivity, and mitochondrial energy production has been key in understanding the mechanism by which disease happens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been intending to study brain biology when I went to university, but the dogmatism in the nerve biology department made me look elsewhere. I found that reproductive physiology was an open, more scientific area. After I finished my thesis on the aging of the reproductive system, I went back and applied that information to how the brain works and spent a year or two writing my book, *Mind and Tissue*.

**Andrew Murray:** Did you find the subject of reproductive physiology as dogmatic as the other branches of science?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not at all. My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, had been one of the pioneers in exploring the effects of vitamin E as a fertility nutrient. In the 1930s and 40s, vitamin E was recognized as protection against polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) and against estrogen. Both of those interfered with oxidative energy production. Vitamin E was preserving the ability of tissues to oxidize properly. It has come to be known as an antioxidant, but really it should be thought of as a normalizer of good oxidative metabolism.

## The Politics of Science and Fluoride

**Andrew Murray:** That brings me to another point regarding being informed. Most people, including myself until about eight years ago, are dogmatically brainwashed by the industry providing medical education. It wasn't until I looked at a holistic way of approaching disease that I discovered the lies fed through the system. Wherever there is prestige and big amounts of money, there is a huge amount of corruption.

I want to discuss things we think are good for us because the government allows them, but where the science is actually phony. Let's start with fluoride. The fluoride put in our drinking water is not a pharmaceutical-grade additive; it is an industrial waste byproduct. With increasing aluminum production in the early 20th century, manufacturers needed somewhere to put the fluoride waste. They commissioned research to support adding fluoride to the water supply.

The main fluoride chemical added to water today is hydrofluorosilicic acid, a byproduct from the phosphate fertilizer industry. Fluoride given to rats has been proven to cause bone cancer, liver cancer, and a host of other ailments. Dr. Peat, is there any logic to anything they're saying about fluoride and teeth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I read a few studies in the 1970s in which they compared villages that had high fluoride or zero fluoride added to the water. It happens that the teeth were healthier in the village *without* the fluoride. Some of the early studies were done in Montana towns where the water was naturally mineralized. They were getting trace minerals natural in the mountain water—magnesium, molybdenum, and others—that helped the teeth mature properly. They didn't control for that; they blamed the fluoride content for the good dental health.

I went to hear John Yiamouyiannis talk. He was debating a dentist who claimed to be an expert on fluoridation. Yiamouyiannis had worked for the abstracting service *Biological Abstracts* and was familiar with 15,000 studies on fluoride, so he could make any opponent look ridiculous. Yiamouyiannis and Dean Burk did a study in Los Angeles and found that cancer incidence increased after fluoride was added. Dean Burk was one of the best cancer researchers in the world—a colleague of Otto Warburg—but his reputation was damaged by getting involved with fluoride.

## Nitrates, Nitrites, and Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** It is unfortunate that people who align themselves with the truth are often attacked. I want to ask you about nitrates and nitrites. These are common preservatives, but there is no real scientific proof that they are safe.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around 1970, there were studies of nitrosamines—compounds mostly involving proline or other amino acids reacting with nitrates in the stomach. It came out that they were very powerful carcinogens and are formed in cigarette smoke.

The farm industry was forcing greater production by using artificial, high-nitrate fertilizers. Spinach produced with those fertilizers will grow very quickly, but it causes it to contain several times as much nitrate as normal vegetables. The cooking process alone forms the nitrosamines.

**Andrew Murray:** So well-cooked spinach, even when boiled, can form these?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even vegetables which have the reputation for being associated with low cancer incidence can produce the same sort of carcinogen as tobacco smoke if they are industrially over-fertilized with nitrate and cooked thoroughly.

**Michael (Producer):** I found a little information. I believe synthetic fertilizers are not organically listed. The highest nitrogen content I found in a quick search was about 12% in feather meal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In organic farming, the nitrogen could be in the form of ammonia. That would be the safe way for the plants to get their nitrogen. But when they are forced with an excess of nitrogen, they simply absorb the nitrate or nitrite in a crude chemical form that isn't doing the plant any good.

When you eat it, it circulates in your body and is exposed to many layers of enzymic and non-enzymic interactions. Free radicals, as well as reductases, will convert nitrate to nitrite, and then to nitric oxide. Those increase according to your level of stress. So when you're eating food that contains preservatives like processed meats, or industrially produced vegetables, you're creating the conditions for a bad reaction to stress.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And if you're stressed out when you're eating, that makes it even worse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With old age, the conversion of the ordinary protein arginine to nitric oxide is accelerated by the various things that interfere with your cellular oxidation. If you add environmental nitrates or nitrites to that, you're making your ability to resist stress weaker because these things accumulate and become a more abundant source of nitric oxide, which then feeds back and blocks the ability to use oxygen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about naturally derived nitrates from celery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they're just as bad.

**Andrew Murray:** Because the bottom line is they are still producing nitrate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The industry argues that brain circulation supposedly goes with intelligence. If you increase the diameter of the blood vessels by increasing your nitric oxide, you're going to reverse the process of brain aging by getting more blood circulating. It does help the brain to circulate more blood, but the problem is that nitric oxide at the same time is blocking the ability to *use* the oxygen. It is imitating a shock state.

In spontaneously age-accelerated rats, which are genetic mutants that age at three or four times the normal rate, they happen to produce tremendous amounts of nitric oxide. The people arguing for nitric oxide products say that's because they're defective and need more. But when you intervene—for example, exposing an organism to overdoses of ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation—you create changes similar to aging. You can extract the liquid from an irradiated organism, and that liquid will produce the same deterioration in others. This "bystander effect" is largely the result of overproduction of nitric oxide.

## Cannabis and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** I got an email from a listener in Germany who wanted to know your opinion on cannabis. He was frightened by the negative effects he recognized. What are your views on cannabis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was 10 years old, a doctor prescribed it for migraines. I took a glass of the tea every day for about a month—a big bag full of cannabis leaves—and I didn't notice any effect. I was never impressed by the claims for its sedative or painkilling effects.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think of the potential estrogenic effect of it? It is in the same family as hops (*Humulus lupulus*). In England, women picking hops would often skip their menstrual cycle because it was such a disruptor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does have an anti-testosterone effect. I think the worst effects are when it's smoked because the smoke itself has an estrogen action.

**Andrew Murray:** And you view estrogen as a negative, pro-inflammatory hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In general. It activates the immune system in a short-term, antibody-producing way that is useful in certain situations. But women have a very high incidence of autoimmune disorders because it impairs the energy resources at the same time that it's making these short-term emergency changes in the immune system.

## Government Corruption and Learned Helplessness

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line.

**Caller (David from Missouri):** I'm glad you're talking about the government. There is a lot of confusion about political systems, but our government appears to be a corporate structure run by corporations. We are baffled by fluoride being put in our water, but it appears to be part of a larger agenda. Dr. Peat has awakened me to the idea of "learned helplessness." The program seems designed to get the population to learn helplessness so we don't realize what is going on.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I talked to old people when I was young to try to find out what it was like 50 years before my time. My impression is that it has been declining rapidly for about 150 years. In the 60 years that I've been studying politics, the problems I saw in the late 1940s and 50s have grown. Basically, it is corporate control using education and the media to make people think things are progressing. The story that lifespan has been lengthened and the cancer war is being won is simply fraudulent statistics. The adult lifespan in ancient Rome was about the same as 20th-century America.

## GE Corn and Fertility

**Andrew Murray:** I want to open up another subject: an Austrian study finding that eating GE (Genetically Engineered) corn may reduce fertility. The study, led by Dr. Jurgen Zentek, found that mice fed GE corn produced fewer offspring than those fed conventional corn. The effects were particularly pronounced in the third and fourth litters. The authors attributed this to the GE corn feed.

It's no surprise that US regulators did not catch this, as no long-term animal feeding trials are required before allowing GE crops on the market. Also, male corn farm workers who regularly work with Atrazine are found to have lower sperm counts.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And if your corn is not organic, you can bet it's GMO.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I know you talked about potassium nitrate being a sperm count reducer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There was an experiment giving it to full-grown bulls. They analyzed their testicles and found that immediately, with a moderate dose, their testosterone production went down, then the sperm count went down, and it stayed low. The testicles were permanently damaged after they stopped giving them the doses.

**Andrew Murray:** Is potassium nitrate added directly to feed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nitrite is actually worse because it's chemically closer to nitric oxide.

## Multivitamins and Calcium

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our next caller.

**Caller (Pepperwood):** I've always wondered, are multivitamins good? Should we be taking them as we age? And for women, should we take calcium supplements or just eat calcium-rich foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are situations where multivitamins could be useful if you're in a really bad situation for getting good food. But the trouble is that they aren't generally well formulated, and even the best formulations are made with somewhat contaminated chemicals.

About 40 years ago, I found that I was having migraine headaches every time I took certain vitamins, especially vitamin B2 (riboflavin). I found that essentially all the people I talked to with serious allergy problems were taking vitamin supplements. When they stopped the supplements, they recovered from their chronic allergy symptoms. I'm convinced that unless it's a very special situation, it's better to avoid supplements and choose foods for their high nutrient content.

**Andrew Murray:** What foods should people gravitate toward?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always recommend eggs and liver as the easiest way to get both trace minerals and vitamins. Vitamin B2 is one where I've seen lots of serious deficiencies—people with red nose, rosacea, nosebleeds, mood problems, and poor memory. You can't use oxygen if you're deficient in vitamin B2. But the synthetics are allergenic, and if you take a large amount, it can sensitize your skin and eyes to sunlight. Even blue light will react with riboflavin in your eyes and skin, causing free radical chains.

**Andrew Murray:** What dosage would you recommend for B2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Five or ten milligrams.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding calcium, I know you are a big proponent of milk and cheese. Any other sources?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Green leaves, if they're well cooked and grown organically, are a great source of calcium and magnesium.

## Nitric Oxide Supplements

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller.

**Caller (Eureka):** I was wondering about products that specifically say they'll boost nitric oxide, like Super Beets.

**Andrew Murray:** That is something you don't want. There is a big campaign to promote nitric oxide as healthy. The Viagra industry is based on nitric oxide as a means to get vasodilation, but it can promote heart attacks and cardiovascular accidents.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And atrophy of the testicles.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, are red beets high in arginine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think they are. Maybe they're feeding them extra nitrate so they can claim that they're "Super Beets."

## Non-GMO vs. Organic Labeling

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller (Humboldt):** If something is "Non-GMO Project Verified," can they still use glyphosate and Atrazine?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes. If it's non-GMO, it doesn't mean the farmer doesn't use agrochemicals. If it isn't organic, you can almost surely guarantee that agrochemicals are being used. The only way you can be sure is to buy Certified Organic products. According to the USDA, you are not allowed to use those chemicals on certified organic products.

**Caller (Humboldt):** So Non-GMO Project Verified is just a stepping stone?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes.

## Historical Use of Potassium Nitrate

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, you were going to tell us something about when you were a kid regarding potassium nitrate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Veterans believed that they had been fed potassium nitrate in their food. I read old 17th and 18th-century texts that described it as a treatment for prisoners and soldiers to decrease their libido so that they could attend a war or not be interested in romance. For hundreds of years, that was a popular concept.

The recent experiments with bulls show that it does stop the production of testosterone. But if you look on the internet, the popular medical sites say that's a big myth. They forget that for hundreds of years, people recognized the effect.

**Andrew Murray:** It sounds like the concentration camp experiments.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Barbara Seaman, a great researcher on estrogen, gave the story of the German experiments in the concentration camps using estrogen to make the prisoners passive. She compared that to the American medical practice of prescribing estrogen to practically all the women in the country.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is potassium nitrate found in specific foods or is it just an additive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's mainly an additive used for making meat red. It functions as a substitute for oxygen in the hemoglobin.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat. For those listening, you can find more information at www.raypeat.com. He produces research because he is passionate about it. Thank you for joining us.
