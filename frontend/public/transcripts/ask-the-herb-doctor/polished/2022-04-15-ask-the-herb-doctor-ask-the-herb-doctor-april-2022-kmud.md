## Introduction: COVID-19 Data and Trends

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome.

**Andrew Murray:** Today is Friday, April 15, 2022. The subject of this month's discourse is COVID: the more you vaccinate, the greater your chance of getting COVID. We'll be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat in just a bit.

I want to open the show with a discussion on COVID, authoritarianism, free speech, and disinformation. An article by Steve Kirsch from April 6, 2022, outlines worldwide reporting, including evaluations done by the governments of Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. In the case of the UK Health Security Agency, instead of stopping the vaccines, the government stopped the data as the results implied vaccine-driven infections were becoming widespread. The main cause of continuing viral infection appears to be the continued drive to vaccinate the general public.

In the early days of the pandemic, people like Professor Sucharit Bhakdi were warning about repercussions, stating thrombosis and clot formation were likely. Many sudden deaths have occurred, especially in the young. Fifteen countries suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine after disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous thrombosis were highlighted as causes.

It seems that the hype and social control are losing traction as we learn to live with, not vaccinate against, COVID. However, cardiomyopathies among the young have increased at an alarming rate, along with sudden cardiac arrest, multiple autoimmune syndromes, and stroke. Dr. Peter McCullough exemplifies the pushback against this in his tireless crusades to Senate testimonies and international governments. Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer of the technology used to create the experimental drug, and many other scientists have opposed it from the beginning.

Dr. Peat, you stated this from the beginning also. It is a testimony to you that you were sounding an alarm regarding the fabrication of infection and death data early in 2020. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining us. Would you please outline your academic and scientific background for listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was working in the humanities, linguistics in particular, for several years before I decided to go back to graduate school. I first intended to concentrate on brain biology, but seeing the dogmatic nature of that department, I looked for a more scientific part of biology and found reproductive physiology. I did my dissertation on the physiology of aging in the reproductive system, especially oxidative changes with age. Since then, I've been applying those insights to studying brain physiology with a new perspective and working out ways to intervene in the problems of aging and stress.

## Mortality Data and Economic Shifts

**Andrew Murray:** You were right there in March 2020 saying there was something seriously wrong with the data regarding infection rates.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, can you outline what you saw happening with the overall mortality in the first couple of months of 2020?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For the last months of 2019 into the first few months of 2020, the CDC showed a historically unique drop in the total mortality of the United States. That was very attention-getting. By the summer, they did another historically unique thing of going back and revising the numbers. People were asking if they had "saved up" and not reported deaths for several months with the foreknowledge that they would need documentation for a surge of death when the pandemic was declared.

Just as a few of us were predicting that weird historical process, it was revised. I think it was in May or June that the CDC said that was mistaken and that health departments were slow in reporting. But looking at the same figures, the very week that the pandemic death surge occurred, it happened again uniquely in history: the annual number of deaths ascribed to influenza—which had been going on as long as records were kept—suddenly disappeared from the record. They fell off a cliff the very week the high death rate was reported for COVID. Anyone that looked at the numbers found it impossible to believe that was a statistical event other than manipulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few people, like James Corbett with the Corbett Report, had already been tracking this. He looked at speeches given by Eric Schmidt, formerly of Google, who moved over to the Pentagon. In the spring of 2019, Schmidt was giving the judgment of his committee confirming ideas put out around 2010 by the Rockefeller Foundation. Schmidt and the Pentagon said their projections were right: we have to destroy the existing "legacy" economies so we can install artificial intelligence digital economies to keep the Chinese from dominating the world economy.

James Corbett watched the Federal Reserve and the CEOs of giant corporations taking precautions. You could see the movement in the money; something was about to go haywire in the financial system. The practice runs for a coronavirus pandemic, which had been acted out in New York in the fall of 2019, were in place and ready to install as soon as they had a real-world event to justify these extreme changes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That pandemic play-out was Event 201, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a mock-up of what they would do around the world simultaneously. The plan, going back to the Rockefeller Foundation ten years earlier, was to use that as an excuse to destroy the old economies, allowing digital economies and AI to take over. The purpose was to prevent the worldwide financial crisis from hurting the billionaire class. By destroying middle-class, medium, and small businesses via lockdowns, people had to do their shopping online. Amazon got a gigantic multi-billion dollar boost. It was clear they intended to shift power and wealth from the masses to the billionaire monopoly class.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's what some people said—Walmart didn't close, but independent shop owners were put out of business.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the billionaires multiplied their wealth hugely. Recently, as people were getting informed about the nature of the pandemic, the government came up with further manipulation of finances. Everyone who heats their house or drives a car is paying several times more, while American oil companies have had a tremendous increase in sales under the pressure of cutting off cheap gas and oil from Russia. The sanctions are taking money away from Americans and giving it to the billionaires and the Russian economy.

## Vaccine Mechanisms and Natural Immunity

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, Steve Kirsch's newsletter outlined results from the UK, New Zealand, and Australian governments showing that the fully vaccinated are infected at twice the rate of the unvaccinated. Australia saw a record-breaking outbreak with a 1,700% higher death rate than the start of the pandemic. How would you speak to the increasing infection amongst the vaccinated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few virologists have been giving the mechanisms that explain it. The German virologist Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi has very good videos showing the difference between native immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. Natural immunity, which lasts a lifetime, is completely different. Originally, they said the vaccines would produce a lifetime of immunity, but it has turned out that all vaccines in use last only a short time. It is especially true with the COVID-19 RNA vaccines; they fade out in just a few months.

Dr. Bhakdi explains that you are going backwards the more booster shots you take. Natural immunity involves the skin or mucous membranes. Infections occur through the skin, inhalation, or ingestion. Those routes activate an extremely complex system starting from the surfaces inside the skin and lining of the digestive system. There are cascades of reactions ending up with antibodies, but antibodies in natural immunity are just a tiny backup part of the process. The real immunity involves your whole body.

The smallpox vaccine was effective because it was given by a natural intradermal scratching of the skin with the antigen. That activated natural immunity. However, doctors looking at records of children whose parents declined vaccination found the difference is essentially black and white. The kids who avoided the standard intramuscular vaccines were in a different group, having almost no sicknesses during childhood and drastically lower rates of hyperactivity syndromes.

For over 100 years, people have studied the effect of injecting anything intramuscularly, especially if it comes with a powerful producer of inflammation like aluminum hydroxide. When injected into the muscle, it goes directly into contact with nerve axons and blood vessels. Animal experiments show that the antigen and micro-particles of aluminum hydroxide are taken up by the nerve axons and transported directly into the cell body in the brain or spinal cord.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's very interesting. When we were studying in England, the government microbiologists told us the only successful vaccine in history was the smallpox vaccine. I wonder if medicine will come around to making vaccines like that, scratched into the skin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the history, one branch of professional medicine wanted to monopolize the business and keep herbalists, homeopaths, and naturopaths out. They got laws passed that gave them a monopoly on injecting things. There was no science justifying the need to inject a drug; it was simply a way of monopolizing the administration of drugs. That got carried over to giving vaccines in the worst possible way.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How would you respond to someone who says, "I might still get SARS-CoV-2, but I won't die from it and the symptoms will be much less severe"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ask for the evidence supporting that. The CDC, when they saw the vaccine didn't prevent infections or spread, simply said it prevents hospitalizations and death. But they manipulated the figures by including people who had not been vaccinated in the early months. Now, figures like Steve Kirsch's show that more people are dying and being hospitalized in proportion to their number of vaccinations.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that was a talking point for Big Pharma?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, just a made-up phrase repeated until people accepted it as truth.

## Caller: Infection Rates and Long COVID

**Caller (Humboldt):** I wanted to comment on the statement about the vaccinated getting infected at higher rates. Since the majority of people are vaccinated, the numbers are naturally higher in that cohort. Also, the Omicron variants are bypassing immunity. Secondly, I never got vaccinated and I got infected twice—the alpha variant and then Delta. I got Long COVID after the first one. I just want to stress that there are a significant number of young, healthy people getting seriously ill. We shouldn't dismiss it as not a real pandemic.

**Andrew Murray:** I appreciate your candid questioning. Regarding the statistics, in our county, I don't think we have a fully inoculated public—maybe 60%. The reports I mentioned, specifically from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, show rates that account for this. For example, the Australian data showed a massive increase in hospitalized patients who are vaccinated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Regarding the diagnosis, the PCR tests have been proven to have false positives, and the rapid antigen tests are fairly inaccurate. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test fine print says you can have a false positive if you've ever been exposed to a coronavirus, such as the common cold. Some of these cases may be influenza-like illnesses misdiagnosed. However, we aren't saying this doesn't kill people. Influenza kills people every year. We are saying the data figures don't match up because influenza shouldn't just disappear.

## Mass Formation Psychosis and Authoritarianism

**Caller:** Why do doctors and nurses seem so powerless? It seems like the majority would be on the right side, but the unions aren't standing up against Big Pharma.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is some brute force involved—they lose their job or license if they don't follow the proper political line.

**Andrew Murray:** A lot of it is fear and financial control. I want to mention "mass formation psychosis." This is defined as aligning a large part of society to a certain cause where their attention focuses on one small point. It has been used to describe the ascent of Hitler. For COVID, this took the form of the vaccine narrative and the imperative that governments knew best. Dr. Peat, we've covered totalitarianism before. What is your take on this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The educational system is increasingly like a boot camp. Medical school overworks students and deprives them of sleep, which are effectively brainwashing techniques to get them to conform and not question authority. Dr. Mattias Desmet's analogy between the virus/vaccine cults and the Nazi cult is very close.

Democracies use subtler methods like public relations and propaganda. "Manufacturing consent" is the idea of using PR and education to keep people from thinking about actual issues, turning it into "us against them." If you have pre-existing factors like loneliness, loss of social bonds, and meaningless jobs, people are susceptible to this.

## Caller: Tylenol vs. Vaccines

**Caller (James from Arizona):** My niece was recently vaccinated with MMR and chickenpox. She had a temperature within a week, my mom gave her Tylenol, and she had a febrile seizure. Is this a vaccine problem or a Tylenol problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tylenol has very serious side effects. Prenatal use of Tylenol is associated with an increased risk of autism. It is a matter of toxic effects. Any inflammation or poisoning by something such as Tylenol will increase neurological defects. They warn people not to use aspirin before getting vaccinated because aspirin actually defends against the harmful effects of vaccines. Tylenol is poisonous enough that it doesn't protect against the inflammatory damage.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. For those listening, Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com. He has been doing this for over 40 years and has many articles and books available. I'm Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you for joining us. Good night.
