## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the show, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbs, supplements, and nutritional counseling. You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of "Exploring Alternatives."

I want to introduce our main guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for joining us again. For those who have never heard your voice or read your work, would you outline your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got a master's degree in General Studies with work in literature and philosophy from the University of Oregon. About eight years later, I went back to specialize in biology, especially the physiology of aging and reproduction, for a PhD in 1972.

## Trustanoia and the Medical Industry

**Andrew Murray:** In your recent newsletter, "Comments on Cancer Therapy," you discussed a phrase—I think you coined it—"trustanoia." You defined paranoia as the belief that powerful forces are trying to harm you, whereas "trustanoia" is the irrational belief that those in power are working for your benefit.

You outlined a chronology culminating in the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations at the beginning of the 20th century. This was pivotal in establishing the false religion of mechanistic biology, as opposed to holistic research. This holistic research is only just emerging in publications from scientists like Gilbert Ling, Gerald Pollack, and Mae-Wan Ho. Can you discuss the shift in perception occurring away from the dogma that has been upheld for so long?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, I want to mention that the word "trustanoia" was claimed by Laura Nader, the anthropologist.

Regarding the shift of perception, I think it's only partial. In biology, there is a lot of good science picking up from ideas that were suppressed around the Second World War. At that time, the medical establishment fused itself with state power and foundations. Science developed by the government for warfare was shifted to take advantage of these mechanistic ideas that medicine had developed.

The government and the medical establishment began working together powerfully right after WWII, with money flowing from the government to medical research that was sometimes indistinguishable from biological warfare research. Some of the same people went right from one field to the other. For example, Carleton Gajdusek, who got the Nobel Prize for slow virus research, was working in biological warfare. I suspect the "slow virus" idea was a cover-up for the effects of radiation on the brain and other organisms, rather than this hypothetical virus Gajdusek invented.

The dogma essentially denied all traditional ideas of biology and the nature of life to impose the idea that things are predefined. From Gregor Mendel in the 19th century, the idea of the gene was used to deny that plant and animal breeders were really changing the plants. If they produced big animals from little animals, the textbooks said, "Well, these were genes that existed previously; we have simply revealed them."

It was a metaphysics—making up the story to explain things that could more easily be explained by the idea that the organism is highly adaptive. The gene idea allowed people to claim that now that we are in control of the genes, we can make organisms the way we want them, with no danger of things being unpredictable. However, people like Barbara McClintock in the 1940s and 50s demonstrated that organisms can change their own genes to adapt to situations.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So what do you think is going to happen with genetically modified organisms? Do you think they're going to start changing the genes that have been put in them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you realize how ignorant the molecular biologists and geneticists have been, you have to worry that things could be much worse than anyone has suspected. James Watson, of Watson and Crick who discovered the double helix of DNA, is now 88 years old. A couple of weeks ago, he was quoted in the *New York Times* saying that if he were starting over to understand cancer, he would not study molecular biology; he would study biochemistry. He said he never thought he would have to learn the Krebs cycle, but decided recently it would be necessary. The arrogance of these geneticists meant that they simply didn't have to know anything at all about biology.

## Heroic Medicine and Research Control

**Andrew Murray:** You made an interesting point in your newsletter that science was becoming a private matter, specifically regarding the procuring of radioactive isotopes for research. Governments would be entirely responsible for distributing these substances, allowing them to predict outcomes and control the material.

You also referenced the early stages of the medical industry, where doctors wanted government protection from other practitioners. You mentioned "heroic medicine," which included mercury, bleeding, vomiting, and purgative mechanisms that killed a large proportion of patients. People turned to alternatives because the doctors were overtly killing people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Recently, anthropologists were able to identify the places where the Lewis and Clark expedition had camped by finding so much mercury in the soil.

**Andrew Murray:** Oh, my goodness. It seems like a protectionist racket. A lot of research is hard to replicate because the products are issued under controlled circumstances. We often find PhD research showing the opposite of what the "authority" tells us—for example, that sugar, salt, and saturated fat are essential, not bad for you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is one group whose papers I've read over a period of about 50 years. Back in the 50s and 60s, Otto Warburg had completely ignored the gene mutation theory of cancer and was showing that it was understandable in terms of a simple metabolic imbalance. Starting in the 1960s, the Pentagon started financing people to debunk and defame Otto Warburg. One of these groups is still publishing as recently as last year, saying Warburg was wrong. They are misinterpreting what Warburg said, but it's important to note that the Pentagon has consistently financed people to push a doctrine that invalidates the metabolic theory of cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** It's as if our tax dollars should be supporting the Pentagon to do such work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When they have hundreds of billions of dollars to spend on their conspiracy, it becomes so pervasive you can hardly say it's a conspiracy; it's an alternate reality that they're constructing.

## Caller: Alternatives for Emphysema

**Caller:** I'd like to ask the doctor if he could talk about any alternatives for emphysema, other than the pills and respirators they give.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've had a couple of very interesting experiences with people who had a diagnosis of emphysema and extremely inefficient lungs. One person was purple in the face and his memory was affected because he was getting so little oxygen to his brain. The other was a woman in her 30s who had been that way for about 15 years.

In the woman's case, it started when she had multiple estrogen injections when she was about 20. That got me reading about the history of experimental emphysema. They found they could reduce the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen by 90% in just an hour after an injection of an excess amount of estrogen.

In the case of the man, I suspected it was a combination of too much unsaturated fat in his diet—increasing his estrogen actions—and decreased thyroid function. I gave him some progesterone and pregnenolone and a little thyroid. Two weeks later, I saw him in Toluca, at an altitude well over 8,000 feet. He took me up to his office in a building without an elevator, zooming up the ramps. He was 82 or 83 years old and had fully functional lungs as quickly as two weeks.

The young woman noticed she felt better when a doctor prescribed Armour Thyroid. She kept talking him into giving her bigger doses until she got up to five grains. She then went to another doctor and got another five grains, and then a third doctor. With 15 grains of thyroid a day, she recovered completely over a period of two or three months.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wow.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't activate the thyroxine in Armour Thyroid, which is three-quarters of the active material, you're only getting a fourth of it. So in effect, she was only getting about four grains of activity.

**Andrew Murray:** So emphysema in these cases is really an energy depletion and factors contributing to inflammation, which are pushed back by thyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There were animal studies 30 or 40 years ago in which progesterone resolved their emphysema. Pregnenolone and progesterone both allow cells to handle water properly so that they don't swell up, retaining normal elasticity.

## Caller: Clonidine and Adrenaline

**Caller:** What do you think of using the anti-adrenaline drug Clonidine to reduce adrenaline at night? I've read of people using a 100-microgram dose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A low-thyroid person sometimes compensates by producing gigantic amounts of adrenaline just to keep running. It helps maintain their body temperature and keeps their heart rate up. They can even seem hyperthyroid when they have very little T3 production. When these people have their daily adrenaline measured, some are making 30 or 40 times the normal amount just to compensate for hypothyroidism.

Those people often feel a great reduction of anxiety and tension with Clonidine. However, since the adrenaline is compensating—keeping their blood sugar up, for example—it is important to be very cautious when you oppose the adrenaline, because it can sometimes give you asthma or low blood sugar.

**Caller:** Do you think it could be used safely at 100 micrograms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never experimented with it myself, so I don't know the right dose.

**Caller:** I've also read that it lowers cortisol. Do you think that is direct, or an indirect result of lowering adrenaline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cortisol generally follows a period of excess adrenaline. If you take your adrenaline down, it might let you lower your cortisol, unless you lower your glucose too much. That can increase your cortisol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Salt and sugar are great ways to lower adrenaline. I recommend to people who get anxious before performing to stir a little salt into a glass of orange juice. It works great.

## Caller: Rhinosinusitis and Taste Buds

**Caller:** I read an article recently about the duality of taste buds. It claimed that bitter taste buds are the body's first line of defense, acting as a filter for bacteria in the nose and releasing nitric oxide. Do you think smoking or forest fires could coat these cilia or taste buds and give you symptoms like rhinosinusitis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, smoking and pollution affect the membranes locally, but when you breathe them, you also swallow them because they dissolve in saliva. In the last few years, people have observed taste buds existing in the intestine. Your intestine can detect the chemistry of what's present.

Otologists have noticed for 100 years that inflammation of the nose and throat very often starts in the intestine. If you have a chemical irritant, stretching from gas, constipation, or an infection in the gut, the nose will get inflamed and start running even with no germ present in the nose. There is a very close integration between the respiratory system and the intestine.

People often neglect this. They take vitamin pills thinking it will help their immunity or allergies, but I've seen dozens of people recover from chronic runny nose when they stopped taking their vitamin and mineral supplements.

**Caller:** Is there any food you would recommend avoiding?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoid irritating foods. Green salads, uncooked vegetables, and many seeds and nuts are always irritating. Some people can have a runny nose from having a salad just once a week; it sets up a chronic irritation in their intestine.

## Caller: Artificial Sweeteners

**Caller:** I was on a low-carb diet for two years and ate a lot of artificial sweeteners. What negative effects have they had, and is it possible to undo them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Artificial sweeteners sometimes activate insulin and cause weight gain just by acting on your hormones, even without increasing food intake. Some of them are excitotoxins if you eat large quantities. Usually, if you stop using them and eat a proper, non-irritating diet, things will correct themselves nutritionally.

## Caller: Seizures and Epilepsy

**Caller:** Do you know of any alternatives for seizure medication?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since we were just talking about the intestine, that should always be taken into account. Make sure you aren't disturbing your system by eating green smoothies, too many nuts, or raw foods. Irritation in the digestive system will increase the things that promote seizures or lower the threshold for them.

The brain is one of our biggest steroid-forming organs; it produces considerable amounts of DHEA, progesterone, and pregnenolone. These have a quieting effect. When the brain is under stress, those increase to compensate.

There are foods that specifically excite and damage the nerves and predispose you to seizures. Amino acids including glutamic acid, aspartic acid, cysteine, and tryptophan are the worst for lowering the seizure threshold. Supplements of progesterone have been used to reduce sensitivity. The threshold to excitation increases in proportion to the amount of pregnenolone and progesterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I had a client with grand mal epilepsy who was able to wean herself off all medication and resume driving. She sticks to a strict diet that doesn't feed intestinal bacteria, takes pregnenolone and progesterone, has a thyroid prescription, and takes anti-adrenaline herbs like valerian, skullcap, and passionflower.

**Caller:** My daughter is 35 and has had seizures since she was 5. We tried Progest-E; she was taking about one to two bottles every three days. She reduced her medication by 75%, but she couldn't keep up that volume.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Has she had her thyroid hormones, including Reverse T3, measured? When someone is resistant to progesterone and needs extremely large amounts, it's usually because their liver is letting estrogen and excitatory substances accumulate. It takes a super-normal amount of progesterone to steady things.

If you eat things your liver needs—avoiding proteins with excitatory cysteine and favoring gelatin or glycine—and shift the balance toward more sugar (orange juice) and efficient thyroid function, the liver can store sugar and eliminate the excitatory estrogen.

## Caller: Hand Tremors and Supplements

**Caller:** Within the last six months, my hands have started to shake with a very fine tremor. I notice it when holding a book or writing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Physiologically, vitamins and minerals are the first things I think of. I've known people who thought they had Parkinson's, and all they needed was Vitamin B12. For others, magnesium supplements have a sudden steadying effect. Sometimes more calcium and Vitamin D will do it. All of these antagonize excitotoxicity and inflammation. Pregnenolone is also always protective; when you are under stress, you use up your steadying steroids faster.

**Caller:** My daughter wanted me to ask about Alpha Lipoic Acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's one of the safer things experimentally. In small amounts, it's safe to experiment with. It is supposed to keep glucose metabolism efficient. Biotin, lipoic acid, Coenzyme Q10, and various B vitamins work together.

**Caller:** You said that higher T3 can lower T4?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are under stress, your Reverse T3 goes up under the influence of cortisol. If you lower cortisol, your Reverse T3 naturally goes down. Everything that helps lower cortisol—sugar, aspirin, B vitamins, minerals—will help free up normal T3 production.

## Caller: Cannabis for Epilepsy

**Caller:** Can cannabis assist with epilepsy?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I would be skeptical about cannabis for epilepsy due to its estrogenic compounds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, for some people it soothes the symptoms, but it is good to be cautious, especially if used in a crude form that might have other plant components that could be irritating.

## Caller: Stevia and Candida

**Caller:** I use Stevia because I have Candida. Is it safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never heard of serious allergic reactions to it; it seems fairly harmless.

Regarding Candida: It thrives when you lack membrane surface antibodies (IgA), which depend on thyroid and progesterone. If you are low thyroid, you will have trouble regulating blood glucose and your immune system will favor Candida overgrowth.

If you starve Candida by cutting off its sugar supply, it can put out filaments and become invasive. If you feed it sugar, it won't invade and become deadly; the worst it does is make too much ethyl alcohol. It can be eradicated easily with a small amount of flowers of sulfur (also called sublimed sulfur). Just 200 milligrams—a large pinch—for two or three days in a row will typically clean up the intestine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is available at pharmacies over the counter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Also, a carrot salad—shredded raw carrots with olive oil, vinegar, and salt—helps. The oil suppresses Candida multiplication, and the carrot has natural antifungal substances.

**Caller:** So you're saying don't do a strict Candida diet?

**Andrew Murray:** The rationale is that starving yourself of glucose puts you at a disadvantage and causes Candida to invade tissues to seek glucose. Keep a normal diet, don't restrict sugar, and use flowers of sulfur.

## Caller: Hormones for Transgender Transition

**Caller:** What is a safe hormone for a person transitioning to a trans female?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone is feminizing if used in large amounts; it antagonizes the effects of testosterone. In France, there were studies 40 years ago where women with facial hair applied progesterone topically, and in two or three months, it feminized their facial hair. When a man takes a moderate amount of progesterone orally, it slows whisker growth greatly.

It is safe for men or women, unlike the estrogen they often use to produce breasts. The low-thyroid person increases the risk of cancer if they use anything estrogenic.

**Caller:** What would be the dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's an individual matter. The quality of your thyroid function, diet, and liver affect the response. If you want to reverse hair growth, you can use it topically. Systemically, it is safe at several milligrams per day. I've experimented with it and saw that I didn't have to shave for a day if I took around 10 milligrams.
