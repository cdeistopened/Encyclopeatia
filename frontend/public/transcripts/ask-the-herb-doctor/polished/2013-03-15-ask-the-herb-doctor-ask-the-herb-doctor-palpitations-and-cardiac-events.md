## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who have never listened to our shows, they run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 to 8:00 PM. We are both licensed medical herbalists who qualified in England with a degree in herbal medicine and produce our own certified organic herb extracts here in the USA. We have a practice here in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

Once again, we're very pleased to introduce Dr. Raymond Peat to the show to share his wisdom with us. Today's topic is palpitations, but it also interweaves many current subjects related to palpitations, such as hormones—especially progesterone—and factors associated with blood clots, myocardial infarcts, and other cardiac events. Let's welcome Dr. Peat to the show.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** We wanted to focus on palpitations this evening. I know there are many factors involved, but we are going to home in on a couple in detail.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Does Dr. Peat want to give our listeners a brief description of his background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied physiology at the University of Oregon for several years, from 1968 to 1972. The circulatory system wasn't my main interest, but I ran across interesting work done in the 1940s by one of my science heroes, Albert Szent-Györgyi, who happened to be studying the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the heart and blood vessels of animals. His work exactly matched what I was doing in animal aging and the effects of those same hormones. So, I was interested in the circulatory system as it relates to the endocrine system especially.

## The Estrogen Myth and Corporate Interests

**Andrew Murray:** I know your main interest is anti-aging and hormones surrounding stress and aging. A lot of what we thought we knew from mainstream medical education and the media seems erroneous in the light of published—albeit rarely included—research. I'm referring to the ongoing hormone debate. With the papers published showing the dangerous effects of estrogen and the beneficial effects of progesterone, testosterone, and thyroid hormone, what are we to understand of the misleading advertising surrounding estrogen's supposedly positive effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the standard thing: what gets into the news, science journals, or universities is strongly influenced by giant corporate interests. Estrogen happens to be very profitable—multi-billions of dollars per year—so they can control the public perception of the hormones in their interest.

Part of the idea of selling estrogen as a beneficial thing was that women live longer than men. Since they were selling estrogen as the "female hormone," they said it must be estrogen that accounts for why women live longer and have a lower incidence of heart disease before menopause. At one point, they actually did a trial of giving estrogen to men. When the men started having more heart attacks, they stopped the experiment. But that didn't kill the idea that estrogen is heart-protective. For 50 years, they carried on promoting the idea of giving estrogen to women to protect their hearts until the Women's Health Initiative results came out, showing women having more heart attacks on the estrogen trial.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why did they start with estrogen? Why didn't they start with progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because there is only one substance that really has the effects of progesterone. Conversely, just about anything that interferes with the use of oxygen has estrogenic effects. Several extracts of soot were demonstrated to be estrogenic. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very estrogenic. Even cyanide has some estrogenic effects. Putting a plastic bag over an animal's head or irradiating any part of the animal with X-rays or gamma rays is estrogenic. The concept of estrogen is easily brought to market in a product, whereas progesterone is one single molecule that can't be imitated exactly with any alteration.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about the price difference to manufacture estrogen versus progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fact that soot extracts are estrogenic means you can produce it for less than one cent per dose if you want to. Progesterone has to be exactly duplicated. For years they were extracting it from the corpus luteum of sow ovaries, and it took tons of ovaries to produce a few grams of progesterone. Eventually, they found how to manufacture it from plant steroids that were closely similar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Like wild yam and trillium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. With a few chemical alterations, they could become exact copies of the progesterone molecule. But since no one could patent that one substance, they introduced small changes, making it no longer progesterone. They said it was "close enough" to progesterone—and claimed it would be better because they had a patent on it. They devised tests that had something in common with the real progesterone molecule, such as a certain change in cells of the uterus, which let them call it a progestin or progestogen. They implied that it supported gestation, but in fact, these were the chemicals that were the basis for the birth control pill because they *prevented* gestation. Really, they should be called anti-progestins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they can patent a drug from soot, but progesterone is expensive and unpatentable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen affects every system, but in pretty much exactly the opposite way that progesterone does. Any tissue that is injured will begin producing its own estrogen. The idea that a woman is estrogen deficient at menopause is a complete fabrication.

Someone measured the estrogen manufactured in a monkey's ovary by measuring the blood going into and coming out of the ovary. As a control, they measured the blood going into and out of the arm of the same monkey. They found that the monkey's arm was producing more estrogen than the ovary. Since women at menopause still have their arms and legs, there's no way they are going to have a decrease in the basic estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the medical myth is that in menopause you suffer from a lack of estrogen, when in fact you're suffering from a lack of progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has been demonstrated and published, but in books rather than journals. The journals are so controlled by the industry that you get real science in books that never get into the medical indexes. Medical schools teach what the medical journals publish, and that's always at least a generation behind the science journals.

## Palpitations and Electrical Instability

**Andrew Murray:** Getting to the subject of palpitations, quite a few people we see in practice mention palpitations as a feature of their physiology. It's been shown in research that estrogen precipitates arrhythmias, whilst progesterone has an inhibiting effect. Could you explain the physiological interactions at work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the very recent articles on that topic concluded that estrogen causes sudden cardiac death, and progesterone prevents it. They were talking about the arrhythmia caused by prolonging the excited phase of the heart action.

The electrocardiogram has several phases. The last phase is called the repolarization wave or the T-wave. When the cell has repolarized, it is ready for a good, strong next beat. But if it is delayed by staying in the excited state too long, the atrium might send a signal for a new beat. If it superimposes on that excited state, the cell can't recover enough to have a proper full beat. It will have a slight premature convulsive movement, but not an effective pumping stroke.

Estrogen is the basic thing that tends to extend the excited state. It is similar to what happens in epilepsy. During periods of greatly excessive estrogen, the brain cells can't get out of the excited state and there's an epileptic seizure. Progesterone prevents that by quickly accelerating the restoration of the readiness state, or the relaxed state, of the nerve. It is the same in the heart muscle or skeletal muscle. Any kind of cell that is excited is quickly restored by either progesterone or thyroid. Both have the energy-restoring effect in slightly different ways. Thyroid increases the energy production needed to relax the nerve or muscle. Progesterone stabilizes the relaxed state so that it can hang on to the energy produced by thyroid. Estrogen interferes with both of those processes, slowing the action potential.

**Andrew Murray:** So thyroid hormone is also able to allow muscles to relax, showing that energy is necessary to allow that relaxation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the cell is in its excited state, besides the electrical changes, many other properties change. For example, one of the immediate effects of estrogen excess is that cells take up more water or release water more slowly. In this fraction of a second of excitation, the cell momentarily takes up a little water, swells, and then as it relaxes, it squeezes the water out. If you are having a premature contraction and not letting it relax fully, the cell gets a little waterlogged with each of these false beats. Estrogen causes a slight waterlogging and swelling of the cell wherever it acts—pituitary, uterus, breast tissue, heart, or nerve.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why so many women had heart attacks during the HRT trial? Because the estrogen was suppressing their thyroid, causing waterlogging, and blocking progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. One of the differences between heart failure in women and men is that the diastolic, or relaxation phase, is more often defective in women. In that poor diastolic relaxation, the cells become progressively more waterlogged and unable to relax. In that over-hydrated state, they also can't get rid of the calcium that comes in when the water enters. It ultimately can lead to actual calcification of the heart. There was a picture published by the Mexican Heart Institute of a very old woman's calcified heart that looked somewhat like a bone. It is the end stage of that chronic over-hydration, over-excited inability to relax.

**Andrew Murray:** And oral contraceptive use in women over 37 who smoke was related to a much higher incidence of stroke and heart attack.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect that the fact that estrogen increases the carbon monoxide in tissue probably overlaps with the high chronic exposure to carbon monoxide in smokers. Air pollution carbon monoxide is highly associated with increased heart events.

## Mechanical Causes of Palpitations

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of palpitations, what is the route to restore normal contractions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are things other than the electrical property or hydration. Blood volume is one factor. For example, high-estrogen women are susceptible to varicose veins, or simply swelling and distension of the veins. Sometimes the veins on the back of the hand swell up, and the legs tend to do that in a high-estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle.

When the veins in the legs are distended, much of the body's blood supply is in the legs, so it isn't coming back to the heart at the normal speed. If the woman stands up and her blood tends to fall into her legs, there will suddenly be a smaller return to the heart. The heart doesn't have very much blood to beat, so it has fast little strokes because the blood simply isn't being returned. That situational arrhythmia or tachycardia is not necessarily connected to electrical instability, but simply to the way the blood isn't getting sent back to the heart.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is linked to high estrogen causing the veins to distend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Progesterone increases the smooth muscle tone in the wall of the veins. If your progesterone is deficient, the veins bulge with very slight pressure. If you hold your hand at your waist, if your progesterone is right, you won't see your veins. But if you're low in progesterone or under stress, even at waist level, you're likely to see bulging veins.

## Caller: Malicious Website Link

**Caller (New Jersey):** I saw something today on Dr. Peat's site I thought he would want to know about. In the article "Calcium and Disease," the words "protein diet" are a link. When I clicked it, I was taken to a commercial for "Sensa" weight loss system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for the warning.

**Andrew Murray:** Somebody is obviously inserting a malicious hyperlink into one of your articles.

**Caller (New Jersey):** What is your understanding of Sensa?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never heard of it.

**Caller (New Jersey):** They say you sprinkle it on food and it enhances taste so you don't eat as much. Sounds like MSG.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'll take a look at the link. Thank you.

## Nutritional Questions: Nettles

**Michael (Announcer):** A listener asks: What is the herbology of stinging nettles? I've been eating a lot lately.

**Andrew Murray:** They contain a lot of calcium. We recommend eggshells as a richer source, but this is the most nutritious time of year to eat nettles. When they are about 18 inches tall, cut them down to ground level. Steam them in a colander for about 10 minutes until limp. The liquid is mineral-rich. It's also an antihistamine for allergies.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's a perfect time for nettle salad. I like to put olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, and feta cheese on top.

**Michael (Announcer):** A caller notes that once nettles are wilted or cooked, they don't sting.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If the fiber is too much for sensitive digestions, boil them and drink the liquid where most minerals will come out.

## Caller: Epilepsy and Hormones

**Caller (Eureka):** You mentioned a connection between seizures/epilepsy and estrogen. Did I understand that correctly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I have an article on my website about that. It's been known for around 70 years that there is a premenstrual type of epilepsy. Animal experiments showed that the ratio between estrogen and progesterone governs the stability of nerve cells. When the ratio is too high (high estrogen), slight stimulation can set off an uncontrollable volley of activity leading to seizures. It's correctable by metabolically lowering that ratio—increasing progesterone and excreting estrogen faster.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You can figure this ratio out by asking your doctor for a blood test for estradiol and progesterone.

## Progesterone for Heart Attacks and Trauma

**Andrew Murray:** I read that prostaglandin synthesis—prostaglandins being inflammatory mediators causing vasoconstriction—is relieved by progesterone. In angina and myocardial infarct, progesterone is important if it can be administered quickly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very much like cortisol as an anti-inflammatory, inhibiting inflammation-promoting things. Prostaglandins are probably the most important ones for people who eat unsaturated fat. However, progesterone doesn't have the harmful side effects of taking cortisol or synthetic glucocorticoids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if you have a heart attack and take aspirin or progesterone, do they both work by blocking prostaglandins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They both stop the inflammatory process which leads to tissue damage. The brain is more sensitive than the heart. Research shows that if you can get a big dose of progesterone to someone who has had a potentially fatal head injury, they will have a high survival and recovery rate because progesterone stops the progression of brain damage. It does the same thing to any tissue that's injured.

## Caller: Mirena IUD and Palpitations

**Caller:** Is it estrogen dominance or low estrogen that typically causes palpitations?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's estrogen dominance or a poor ratio of estradiol to progesterone.

**Caller:** Even if the progesterone is "fake" progesterone in the form of birth control? I had a terrible time while on the Mirena IUD. I believe that triggered my palpitations.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some synthetic progestins actually have some protective effects. There is one called drospirenone that is probably the closest to natural progesterone, and it is used to treat heart failure. However, just the presence of an irritant in the uterus [like an IUD] will lower your natural progesterone. Even if it is releasing progestin, the effect is likely by reducing your ovaries' natural production.

**Caller:** Will my body begin to produce natural progesterone again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, as soon as the irritation stops. If your diet is good, it will recover quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Grated raw carrot is a great way to lower estrogen, along with keeping proteins and saturated fats up.

**Andrew Murray:** The grated raw carrot mops up excess bowel estrogen and toxins.

## Caller: Progesterone Absorption

**Michael (Announcer):** A caller asks: When progesterone is rubbed into the skin, does it absorb properly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you stick your finger in it and are familiar with the taste, in about a minute you can taste the progesterone. It goes right through the skin so you get systemic effects quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've rubbed olive oil and progesterone on a lady with heart failure. Within half an hour, the elevated veins on her hands were completely flattened.

## Aldosterone, Salt, and Thyroid

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned aldosterone as being a compound that can be problematic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several things start the process toward hypertension, inflammation, and degeneration. Low blood sugar is enough to signal your kidneys to send out renin, starting the process to produce aldosterone. Not eating enough salt also raises aldosterone. If your blood vessels leak—for example, due to hyperventilating—you lose blood volume.

Anything that lowers blood volume, sugar, or sodium will cause your kidneys to increase aldosterone. Aldosterone's function is to keep sodium inside your bloodstream to prevent edema and nourish tissues. However, the side effect is that instead of losing sodium, you lose potassium and magnesium. The loss of potassium and magnesium causes heart rhythm problems. The repolarizing process of the heart muscle requires the cell to retain magnesium and potassium and excrete the excitatory sodium and calcium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why women tend to swell premenstrually? With dropping progesterone, they have rising aldosterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Protein deficiency is another thing that will start this whole process. Behind the balance of aldosterone, estrogen, and progesterone is the thyroid function.

## Caller: Lupus and Seizures

**Caller (Phillipsville):** I am dealing with lupus and have a grand mal seizure once a month associated with my menstrual cycle. I've also registered as having low sodium, but doctors debated if it was Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) or cerebral salt wasting from a brain injury.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid is the main cause of that inappropriate loss of sodium. Hospitals seem to realize how important sodium loss is, especially in older people, but it happens under the influence of estrogen too.

**Caller (Phillipsville):** I know from my research that catamenial epilepsy goes along with low progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Caller: Varicose Veins in Men

**Caller:** I have rope veins in one leg. What would happen if I rubbed progesterone on my skin as a male?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some men use progesterone successfully, often for varicose veins. However, I think the best thing is to start with **Pregnenolone** orally. It can produce testosterone and DHEA as well as progesterone, so it tends to keep your hormones more in balance than applying big doses of progesterone.

**Michael (Announcer):** How much sodium should a 155-pound, 42-year-old male intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Your taste and craving are the best way to judge. Everything affects your thyroid hormone. If your thyroid is a little low, you need lots more sodium. If your thyroid function is good, you can get along with very low sodium. Women tend to have salt cravings around ovulation or pregnancy because excess estrogen and low thyroid/progesterone cause sodium loss. If your thyroid and hormones are good, you don't have to worry about adding salt to your food.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, on a comprehensive metabolic panel, albumin works with sodium and thyroid to regulate blood volume.
