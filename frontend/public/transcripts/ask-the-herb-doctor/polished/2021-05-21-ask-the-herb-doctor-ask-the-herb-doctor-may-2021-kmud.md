## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome.

**Andrew Murray:** You're invited to call in with any questions related to this month's topic of mitochondria, immunity, and natural resistance. Once again, we're very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat to weigh in with his expertise on this subject. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** I'll outline what we're going to talk about. The main thrust of tonight's show is going to be natural resistance and immunity, and we're going to discuss the role of mitochondria. There is some very interesting plant-based material responsible for a cell-stabilizing effect that we're going to describe in terms of stabilizing the cell and producing energy in the mitochondria. Dr. Peat, we should probably start by asking you to describe your academic and professional background.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I didn't study biology professionally until about 12 years after graduating from college. I decided to go back and get a PhD at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. Previously, I had been working in literature, education, and various humanities areas. After finishing my PhD in physiology, I continued using the ideas I had researched to apply to different fields, studying the brain in particular, reproductive hormones, and how nutrition interacts with development and health in general.

## Quinones, Pigments, and Mitochondrial Oxidation

**Andrew Murray:** I looked at a wide range of natural products which have been shown to be sources of mast cell stabilizers. In terms of degranulation—the histamine-type reaction upon which inflammation is predicated—there are several different classes of compounds ranging from flavonoids to coumarins, cinnamic acid, resveratrol, and quercetin.

I want to get a discussion going regarding the energy potential of cells. We've mentioned medicinal plants like Lapacho (*Tabebuia impetiginosa*, or Pau d'Arco) and Cat's Claw (*Uncaria tomentosa*). Lapacho produces the compound lapachol, and Cat's Claw is used in the treatment of borreliosis. Both of these, as well as the flavonoids we will look at, have very dark pigments. I know you have a fairly clear answer for their benefits regarding mitochondrial function and ATP production. Do you have anything to say on the nature of the pigment and how that pigment acts electronically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was in graduate school, I was working on how mitochondrial oxidation relates not only to aging and fertility but also to resistance against disease and development. Aging is a bad outcome of development, but development of the organism is something that's always happening. When it is under the influence of oxidation, the outcome is constructive. When it's under the influence of something that blocks mitochondrial oxidation, the outcome is always bad.

It was already known in the 1960s that, in general, purple pigments tended to promote better, more efficient oxidation. I was always running around testing various plant materials, especially the purple and red ones. Several people observed that red pigments tended to be sedating and blue pigments stimulating. My main interest was in how the color related to the structure and why it improved mitochondrial oxidation.

In the early years of the 20th century, Frederick Koch, a biochemistry and physiology professor at the University of Michigan, found that a certain way of preparing a catalyst—he used a hot platinum electrode to oxidize alcohol—produced a very intense deep blue or purple pigment. He found that it catalyzed mitochondrial physiology and function. This was many years before the ubiquinone system (Coenzyme Q10) was known. Koch was working on that chemical structure, which he knew to be a quinone, but he hadn't even attempted to extract that material from cells; he just reasoned that it had to be there to catalyze oxygen.

It turned out that this quinone he was producing involved multiple double-bonded carbon-oxygen bonds resonating in relation to each other. The more you have in a sequence interacting with each other, the more powerful it is as an oxidant. After he was effectively chased out of the U.S. by the FDA and FBI, he went to Brazil and studied natural plant substances there. Lapacho was one that he was interested in because of its color. This turns out to be an analog of our own quinone system, or Coenzyme Q10 system, which is also very closely related to the vitamin K structure and the natural anti-inflammatory antibiotics. Tetracyclines have a very intense system of conjugated double bonds analogous to these other natural activators of respiration.

They happen to activate the production of energy as well as increasing the consumption of oxygen. Going back about 70 or 80 years, it was known that anything that uncoupled—reduced the efficiency of energy production in the form of ATP—would make the oxygen system of the mitochondrion run faster and create a more oxidized state of the cell. This principle was used in diet pills because it would make you burn up fat quickly, but it was also found to intensify immunity in the sense of being able to detect and throw off cancer cells that were disseminated but not yet forming tumors. When you made the cells oxidize probably 50% to 100% more intensely than normal by using this uncoupling chemical, the cancer cells would be attacked by the rest of the body, flare up, and be thrown off.

**Andrew Murray:** This is in the presence of these quinones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This particular chemical, dinitrophenol, uses the nitro group, which is actually more toxic than the system the body uses—much riskier. A lot of people killed themselves trying to use that chemical for weight loss. But it illustrates the principle that when you run the system so it oxidizes more thoroughly, it does something to the immune system that resists both infectious organisms and cancer.

One of the changes that happens when you uncouple the cell and increase mitochondrial oxidation is that iron becomes safely put into a storage form, the ferric oxidized form. The opposite of that process happens when the cell has some obstruction to oxygen use. Many toxins and microorganisms can interfere with the use of oxygen. In that case, the iron is reduced electronically and goes into the toxic ferrous form, which creates very powerful free radical forms of oxygen—hydroxyl radicals—which then damage everything in the cell. Protectively, the cell has this basic mechanism of increasing fever, for example, to increase the body temperature and oxidation by a natural form of uncoupling.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So going back to what you said about iron and these quinone compounds found in things like Tabebuia and Pau d'Arco—do those also cause the body to put iron in a safer form rather than the very toxic form you mentioned?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, everything that maintains even the normal rate of cellular oxidation maintains a basic stable cell immune condition. It's only when something has caused a dangerous disruption that the body has to resort to fever to increase that state and go back to its resting normal rate of good, high oxidation.

## Thyroid, Uncoupling, and Flavonoids

**Andrew Murray:** Just in case people aren't familiar with the mitochondria, they are the machinery that generates the energy—organelles within the cell. They use food converted into a chemical called ATP. Essentially, nutrients increase the energy electrons in the form of a substance called NADH. This is used by protein complexes to pump protons, creating a gradient that catalyzes the production of ATP. It is this currency of energy which is used like thyroid very much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid hormone does increase the uncoupled oxidation of glucose, raising the temperature. When you're feeling maximally energized and efficient with good thyroid function, you aren't really being "efficient" in the sense of making a maximum number of ATP per oxygen. Running the oxygen through the system maintains a favorable balance of NAD (the oxidized form) to NADH.

When you block thyroid function or any aspect of the system in the mitochondrion that consumes oxygen, you pile up too much NADH. That is the reducing stress state of the cell.

Some of these plant substances—flavonoids, for example—look like antioxidants or reductants in the test tube because of their hydroxy group. However, once they get inside the cell, they change their structure, lose the hydrogen, create the quinone keto group (the double-bonded oxygen-carbon), and become a catalyst to maintain the oxidized state of the cell and lower the ratio of NADH to NAD.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the cell stabilizing effect, Quercetin is one of these flavonoids that has been mentioned in medical journals along with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for alternative approaches to treating or preventing viral issues. Quercetin is found richly in citrus fruits and dark berries.

We find a lot of the flavonoids are useful in terms of stabilizing mast cells and preventing degranulation—the inflammation from histamine release that produces vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory trouble. These flavonoids range from herbs like Dyer's Weld (*Reseda luteola*) containing luteolin, diosmetin from olives, and apigenin from parsley, artichokes, chamomile, and celery. There is also gingetin from Ginkgo, EGCG from green tea (also in berries and apples), silymarin from milk thistle, and scopoletin.

Other compounds include cinnamic acid from cinnamon, ellagic acid from berries and walnuts, and resveratrol from *Polygonum cuspidatum*. All of these are plant-based compounds, either pigment products or other natural products.

## Caller: Lung Fibrosis and Inflammation

**Caller (David):** I tuned in late. Are you saying that list of herbs would make your tissue "pucker up" and make it harder for the virus to grab on? Also, if COVID makes your lungs "pucker up" so much that they turn into "dead coral" (fibrosis), is there something we could eat that would revive the lungs? Like pruning a tree to get a starter growing from live tissue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The spike protein creates the inability to overcome inflammation. The inflammatory reactions are what kill a person with COVID infection. The mast cells, plain old histamine reactions, prostaglandins—all of the familiar things that we suffer from with a mosquito bite or a bruise—it's exactly the same inflammatory system that goes wrong with COVID and also with cancer.

It shouldn't be surprising that a tremendous range of natural substances, which have very parallel molecular arrangements, will be beneficial in everything from mosquito bites to COVID, cancer, or heart disease. What they're doing is restoring the natural metabolism. The fibrosis in the lungs is the end product of chronic inflammation. Pneumonia caused by influenza, smoking, or the COVID virus all move towards the production of excess collagen, fibrosis, and loss of proper lung function.

One of the first places affected by the virus is the intestine. People will often get diarrhea and a cough associated with inflammation of the intestine caused by the virus even before it appears in the lung tissue. The inflammation of the intestine causes a variety of toxins, including bacterial endotoxin, to get into the system. You get necrosis and interference with oxidative metabolism so that you stop producing carbon dioxide at a proper rate and start making pro-inflammatory lactic acid. That leads to the inflammation in the lungs.

One of the basic protective things to do is to make sure your intestine is not inflamed. That includes avoiding any food that isn't properly digested. Enemas, laxatives, fibrous foods, and even antibiotics to sterilize the intestine should be a part of any major surgery recovery, for example. They know patients recover more successfully from major surgery if they have disinfected and cleaned their bowel, because any major trauma activates that whole systemic inflammatory process, starting with leakage from the bowel.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So really, Dr. Peat is saying that if you keep your intestines healthy and your bowels working well, you'll have less inflammation in the lungs. Things like raw carrot salad, well-cooked mushrooms, taking herbal laxatives like cascara, and eating a generally healthy diet will help keep your intestines in optimum shape.

## Caller: Echinacea and Goldenseal

**Caller:** I'm a holistic health therapist. I treated myself with Echinacea and Goldenseal extract—one drop of a thousand milligrams—and that protects me. It brings my immune system "soldiers" to fight out what can happen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yes, Echinacea and Goldenseal are very good for your immune system. We agree with that.

## Caller: Thyroid and Black Walnut

**Caller:** I'm calling from the outer galaxies. I have Graves' disease, Hashimoto's, and hyperthyroid. As a male, the pharmaceutical options don't work for me. I use Black Walnut tincture to stimulate my thyroid and recommend it because of the radiation affecting everyone's thyroid. What is your opinion on the efficacy of Black Walnut tincture?

**Andrew Murray:** As far as Black Walnut tincture (*Juglans nigra*) is concerned, the main use is as an anti-parasitic. The compound juglone has been shown to be toxic to certain parasites.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's also been mentioned as a useful herb in thyroid disease because it contains minerals like iodine and manganese. However, Dr. Peat, you've said that based on studies, very few people are low thyroid because of a lack of iodine. It's actually quite rare, and too much iodine is very thyroid suppressive. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** In that sense, Black Walnut would not be very useful because that would potentially cause an increase in iodine that would not be favorable.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I did want to mention that Black Walnut, like a lot of nuts such as Brazil nuts, has selenium, and that is pro-thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** I just wanted to mention *Ammi visnaga*, common name Khella. It is an excellent plant-derived mast cell stabilizer. It has been used for kidney disorders, but there is a lot of published research on it. The flavone groups we mentioned—apigenin, quercetin, etc.—decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. When they talk about a "cytokine storm" damaging the lungs, this is the body's natural system unloading on the cells. These flavones decrease histamine, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins responsible for that massive inflammation.

## Caller: Supplements vs. Whole Foods

**Caller:** I'm from Connecticut. There are a lot of products out there with bioflavonoids as supplements. Is there any significant difference or value in buying those supplements versus getting them from the food matrix?

**Andrew Murray:** I think, especially from Dr. Peat's perspective, natural is best. Fresh fruits, especially dark pigmented berries, grapes, and citrus fruits, are excellent sources. That's not to say flavonoid-rich supplements don't work, but eating for your health is the best way to go. Dr. Peat, what is your favorite flavonoid food source?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Considering the balance—many foods also have irritating substances or things that are hard to digest—on balance, citrus juices have the best ratio of anti-inflammatory, pro-metabolic oxidation nutrients. The flavonoids and ascorbic acid are all pro-oxidative metabolic supports, and the juice is very low in indigestible or pro-inflammatory substances.

## Iron and Bacterial Growth

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned iron earlier. I was looking at an article about iron's negative effects in the blood in terms of being pro-bacterial—multiplying bacteria in the presence of iron.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some of it floats freely dissolved in the blood plasma. If a bacterium gets into your bloodstream, bacteria can use it to produce energy the same way we do. Bacteria can thrive on the amount of iron normally in the blood. The body protects itself by drastically reducing the amount of free iron circulating in the body fluids; it binds it up in an oxidized form and holds it inside cells.

That's why a blood measurement of iron can't tell you very much. But if you measure the binding capacity and the amount of bound iron in the form of transferrin saturation—if the transferrin molecule is almost saturated with iron, that means your blood is great food for bacterial replication and overgrowth. You want to have fairly low saturation; 20% to 30% saturation is a healthy range for resistance to bacterial infection and also apparently to cancer multiplication, because iron is one of the things cancer needs to multiply.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's one of the things I like to look at on clients' blood work. Sometimes I'll see clients with 50% saturation, and they usually do not do well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Partly that's because it means the cell isn't oxidizing strongly enough to keep the iron strongly bound up inside cells. It becomes food for invaders.

## Caller: Rhubarb

**Caller:** Plants are such a healing factor. Let me know what you think about rhubarb.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At least the famous Chinese Rhubarb (*Rheum palmatum*) contains chemicals very similar to cascara, lapacho, and our intrinsic ubiquinone. So it can be used medically. I think the root has been used medically more than the rest. The stems are a tasty food, but I don't think they have much of the pigment material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about the red color in the pink rhubarb? We just cooked some up last night. Isn't that full of antioxidants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect that it is.

**Andrew Murray:** The only negative thing perhaps is some of the oxalates it contains, but spinach does the same thing.

## Closing Thoughts on Iron

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an article talking about lactotransferrins from milk and conalbumin from egg white as being very good at binding iron or lowering iron in the serum.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Eggs have been found to be both antibacterial and antiviral, especially in a raw form like an eggnog. They have found that where other forms of lecithin stimulate bacterial or viral growth, the lecithin from egg yolk has a bactericidal and virucidal effect.

**Andrew Murray:** So this would support the athlete's recommendation of drinking a couple of eggs whisked up with a glass of milk. I also saw an article mentioning how much the serum concentration of iron is lowered during fever, and that this is likely one of the body's natural responses to fever induced by bacterial infection.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And the thyroid in good health is doing that all by itself. But when the body is threatened, it can go into that uncoupled, highly oxidative state defensively. When the threat is over, it can go back to relying on thyroid to maintain the high metabolic rate.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for your time again, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.
