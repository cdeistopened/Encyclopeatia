# Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month’s Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend dietary supplements, nutritional counseling, and an alternative approach to health management.

We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us once more. This month's topic is based on his May newsletter regarding cancer metabolism. It touches on the concept of "paranoia versus trust-noia"—how most people trust mainstream medicine to do them right, whereas it is often better to choose wisely and find information from alternative sources.

Dr. Raymond Peat is a wealth of information, definitely outside the box, thinking like so many of the great scientists he quotes, from Szent-Györgyi to Gilbert Ling to Mae-Wan Ho. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to outline what has happened in science that has derailed good research—specifically research that didn't align with the corporate, collectivistic controllers from the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. Institutionalized medicine often ignores or demonizes good science.

Could you outline the history of oxidative metabolism, elucidated by William Frederick Koch, Otto Warburg, and Albert Szent-Györgyi? This really should have been the direction medicine took if it wanted to help people with cancer. Instead, we have a "cidal" approach—killing cancer cells with chemotherapy and radiotherapy—which destroys the organism. How is metabolism seen through the eyes of these great scientists?

## The History of Electrons in Biology

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starting in 1900, the idea of electrons in molecules was just being explored. It was about 1930 or 1935 when mainstream chemists started accepting that there was such a thing as a free radical. But in 1900, Moses Gomberg at the University of Michigan had produced a stable free radical—a free but fairly unreactive electron that produced a deep purple color. This started other chemists thinking about what produces color in molecules.

Over the next few years, chemists theorized about mobile electrons in molecules like benzoquinone. It was only in 1916 that Gilbert Lewis gave his theory of electron bonding, and later Niels Bohr described how electrons orbit around molecules. Linus Pauling then gave a more detailed description of how electrons work in chemical bonds.

So, the very best biochemists were just getting started around 1935 thinking about electrons. Biologists and medical doctors couldn't imagine how electrons could have anything to do with the life process.

The process involved in oxidation is the movement of electrons from a fuel, such as sugar or fat, to oxygen. In that process, there is extractable energy. When biologists finally admitted that electrons had to be explained, they wanted to compartmentalize how the energy is used. They invented little "machines" that would take a quantum of energy out of that moving electron and attach it to pumps or motors to explain muscle contraction. They created a primitive concept of biological energy.

However, the actual process is a flow—a streaming process. There is no standing still for the electron. The cell dies if it isn't constantly moving the electrons from fuel to oxygen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this process is going on with every breath we take, and every single cell in our body is moving these electrons from sugar or fat to oxygen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you try to measure the electrical energy of a cell—by sticking a needle in to measure voltage, for example—people have a static picture of the cell as a bag of randomized molecules. But what they are actually doing is disrupting this intricate, constant flow from fuel to oxygen. They are measuring an injured cell. Every time they try to stop it to fit their model, they destroy some cell process.

## ATP and Muscle Contraction

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, Szent-Györgyi published work on oxidative processes in muscle. He discovered that ATP literally makes muscle contract. He showed that simply adding ATP made the muscle move. However, he found that the contracted muscle in the presence of ATP didn't break down the ATP molecule. The ATP causes muscle to contract without changing its bond structure.

**Andrew Murray:** That is very interesting. Muscle contraction can occur in the absence of the breakdown of ATP? The classic description is that ATP is reduced to ADP and AMP, and the release of that phosphate group drives the muscle. You are saying that is not the way it is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. When I was in graduate school, muscle biologists said ATP has a high-energy bond of 11 or 14 kilocalories per mole, and that energy explained the "motors" in the muscles. Meanwhile, Gilbert Ling, likely aware of Szent-Györgyi’s work, pointed out that the energy of the whole molecule of ATP sticking to the protein of the muscle has an adsorption energy of 21 kilocalories per mole—twice as much as the hypothetical bond energy. That explains why it makes the protein change without having to break down. Simply the relationship between the molecules shifts the whole structure.

**Andrew Murray:** This is a holistic approach to biology. The whole thing is confluent and constant. Electrons don't stop; they are constantly in action. That is life.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We're not talking about high-adrenaline energy. We're talking about energy from a cell functioning properly and having enough thyroid, which basically means the cell has enough oxygen. It is a very calm state, but the cells have a lot of energy in that calm state.

## Cancer, Excitation, and Oxygen

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to this energetic state, how should we understand cancer arising from a depletion of this state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1920s, David Keilin in England was working on cytochromes. He found that when an insect or bird flight muscle was contracting and highly stimulated, the pigment he was studying disappeared, showing there was no oxygen present. The extreme activity had consumed all the oxygen momentarily and shifted the cell into a reduced state of excess electrons.

Szent-Györgyi and Keilin were simultaneously working on ideas that William Frederick Koch had developed independently: it is the flow of electrons through the system to oxygen which has to be continuous.

When something overstimulates or irritates an area—and the irritating effect of things like estrogen was already known—that excitation exhausts the tissue oxygen. This was at the center of the idea of what cancer is. Warburg described it as a defect in respiration where the cancer lacks the Pasteur effect. The Pasteur effect, seen in yeast, is where oxygen normally causes the yeast to stop fermenting (stop producing lactic acid or ethanol).

Szent-Györgyi said there is something wrong with the system that prevents cancer from turning off that excitatory process, even in the presence of oxygen. Something keeps the cell in the excited state.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's a backup mechanism? When the body isn't using oxygen properly, it converts to using sugar inefficiently, creating waste and over-exciting the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When it is either deficient in oxygen or overstimulated so that it uses up all the oxygen, it is the same thing as suffocating. There is no oxygen to turn off the production of lactic acid. The lactic acid itself is an irritant and stimulant. It shifts the cell away from the use of oxygen towards the production of more lactic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It’s a vicious cycle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lactic acid produces an imbalance in the electrons. It takes up some electrons to be formed, but in the process, it increases the alkalinity inside the cell. It creates a circle of more electrons than it can take up.

One way the cancer cell tries to return to normal is to use those excess electrons—that can't be consumed by converting pyruvic acid to lactic acid—to synthesize fat. Interestingly, the cancer cell turns on the enzymes that synthesize fat as a way to drain away more electrons. Then, as oxygen becomes available, the respiratory process will burn fat.

So, the cancer cell is eating all the sugar it can get, tearing down the body's tissue to use amino acids, and converting the energy from glycolysis to fat. It then oxidizes the fat with whatever oxygen it has. Oxidizing fat is less efficient regarding oxygen use, so it adds to the problem of oxygen deficiency.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this where the myth comes in that sugar feeds cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, cancer eats sugar, but sugar deprivation turns on the Warburg effect. It turns on the stress reaction.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it makes the lactic acid and makes the cancer cells worse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you go into ketosis, the stress metabolism turns on the partial oxidation of fatty acids. One of the "ketone bodies" is not actually a ketone; it is a reduced state which increases reductive imbalance. It is almost as bad as lactate.

The stress creates this cycle of excess electron imbalance. This activates things that amplify the stress reaction. For example, the formation of prostaglandins is turned on when there is a shift towards too many electrons (an imbalance towards NADH or reduced sulfhydryl). This turns on aromatase, which makes estrogen, which activates more of the tendency to produce excess electrons.

## CO2 as a Cancer Treatment

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned the inability to relax, the over-excitation, and how the cancer itself is in a very excited state. You also noted that the presence of oxygen calms that excitation down. I know you are an advocate of CO2 having a health benefit. How is oxygen helpful here if we sometimes view it as toxic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** CO2 does at least three central things related to cancer:
1.  It acts like a calming agent, the way ATP relaxes muscles that aren't stimulated.
2.  It is an analog of the pigment molecules Moses Gomberg visualized. It is a Lewis acid. The double-bonded oxygens on the carbon are the essential feature of the free radical oxidative catalysts that Koch and Szent-Györgyi worked with. This acidic effect modifies the proteins so they are stabilized and calmed down, not forced to shift to lactic acid metabolism.
3.  CO2 fills in and corrects what is missing in the Krebs cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle). It replenishes the catalytic effect of the fuel that keeps the oxygen process going.

Just by increasing CO2—breathing in a bag for a minute or so several times a day—you will lower your serum lactic acid. It is only in the last few years that people are recognizing you can diagnose cancer just by an increased chronic lactic acid excess in the blood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why you recommend people with cancer go to high elevation, to increase the amount of CO2 in their bloodstream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There were studies in Russia in the 1960s where they gave carcinogens to rats. They treated some with chemotherapy and took them to 17,000 feet altitude. The ones at high altitude recovered at a very high rate, with or without chemotherapy. About 100 years ago, the insurance industry was already aware that cancer mortality was about 10% lower in cities at high altitudes.

## Pigments and Herbal Therapies

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about pigments. We mentioned the purple pigment Moses Gomberg discovered. In herbal medicine, we use flavonoids, bilberry, blackberries, and anthraquinones found in plants like Cascara, Chinese Rhubarb, and Pau d'Arco. I read on PubMed that anthraquinones have an anti-cancer effect. How do you see those pigments affecting that electronic change?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been several lines of research on emodin, a pigment in aloe, cascara, and Chinese rhubarb. It has a tremendous, unexpected range of functions, including a sedative or quieting effect. It activates oxidative metabolism in cells, suppresses bacteria, and reduces inflammation. These are all properties that W.F. Koch saw in the simple quinone type of oxidative catalyst.

When Koch went to Brazil, he began studying Lapacho (Pau d'Arco), which has a similar multiple-ring structure and a deep color. What these are doing is the same as carbon dioxide: they are modifying or "tuning up" the electrical system of proteins in cells.

The basic idea from Warburg through Szent-Györgyi is that it is pointless to try to kill the cancer as if it were a parasite. When cells are normally fatigued and replaced, the dying cell stimulates the growth of stem cells. This happens in cancer. The natural cancer cell is weak and defective, but every time it dies, it stimulates the replacement of a similar defective cell. The injury caused by killing it stimulates faster replacement.

The alternative idea is to tune up both the tumor metabolism and the metabolism of the surrounding organism.

## Caller Questions

### Altitude and Weather

**Caller (San Jose):** My question is about the altitudes Dr. Peat mentioned. Is there any other factor, like weather, that influences it? For example, Denver versus Albuquerque—fairly similar altitude, but different weather.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Excess humidity is harmful because our osmotic balance is part of the process of tuning up. There is an interaction between oxidation-reduction, pH, and osmolarity. High humidity is a slight stress to the system. Middle-range humidity is good, and as much daylight as possible. 15 hours of daylight seems to be optimal for recovery from cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So being in the Andes would be a good idea—not humid, close to the equator, and high elevation.

**Andrew Murray:** What about Hawaii? It's sea level, but maybe a volcano?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The top of Mauna Kea.

### Amino Acids and Cancer

**Caller (Jordan, Redway):** Dr. Peat, you said cancer cells survive on glucose, and when that is used up, they go to amino acids. Are those the foods of choice for cancer cells? Also, I've heard you say amino acids create a medium that allows cancer to grow, but amino acids are essential. Could you explain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the type of amino acids. Cysteine, tryptophan, and methionine are the ones that most easily promote cancer growth. However, glutamine and several easily metabolized amino acids fuel the production of lactate even when glucose is not available.

The stress that lactic acid reinforces turns on cortisol production. This shifts the balance away from protein synthesis to protein breakdown, providing amino acids. Fatty acids also come into the bloodstream under stress. If those are polyunsaturated, that adds to prostaglandin inflammation.

There have been experiments where cancer growth can be slowed by giving intravenous glucose. A Russian researcher found that with intravenous glucose and higher oxygen, the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma—a classic example of a cell in the Warburg effect—could be reverted to normal metabolism.

### Other Anti-Cancer Therapies

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Aside from CO2, high elevation, and antioxidants like cascara and Pau d'Arco, what else is anti-cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at things known to reduce excitation, anesthetics—like lidocaine—will turn off the excitation enough to slow down cancer growth. Lidocaine has been proven effective against several different cancers, including leukemia and solid tumors in the liver, pancreas, breast, and prostate.

### Surgery and Biopsies

**Caller:** If you have a lump that is contained and hasn't metastasized, would you advocate surgically removing it so it won't be a time bomb?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the context. I've had lumps that doctors advised me to biopsy, and I just changed what I was doing, and the problem went away. If it is hard and stuck to surrounding tissues, then a lumpectomy is probably okay, provided you take precautions against activating the cancer by the surgery itself.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What kind of precautions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For example, surgery done when a woman is in the low progesterone part of the month (before ovulation) is several times more likely to metastasize than in the presence of high progesterone. If you do all the things known to reduce excitation and lactic acid production, then a lumpectomy is relatively safe.

### Thyroid Testing

**Caller (Albion):** I recently went through five years of hard stress and have fatigue. My thyroid levels—TSH and free T4—came back normal but on the low end. Is there another test I could ask for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** T3 is the essential active thyroid hormone. Under stress, T4 is converted to reverse T3, which interferes with function. You cannot interpret thyroid function with just T4 and TSH. You have to consider how much stress is causing it to be converted to the inactive, blocking form.

You want a good ratio of active T3 to reverse T3. If you measure your cortisol, you can usually see what is causing it to be inactive. Glucose is needed to convert T4 to the active T3 form and to hold down cortisol. Any area deficient in oxygen or having excess lactic acid can locally destroy active T3.
