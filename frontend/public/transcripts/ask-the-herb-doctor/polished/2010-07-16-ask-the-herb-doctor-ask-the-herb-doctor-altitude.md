## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions. We manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. You are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's mixed topic of elevation, the protective effects of CO2, and its many health benefits. We are once again very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who will be sharing his research and knowledge of this topic.

For those listeners who perhaps have never heard you speak, Dr. Peat, would you please give us an outline of your academic work before we start this month's show?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started out in literature and painting because I was aware that American biology in particular was pretty backward at the time I was in university. It wasn't until I had got a master's degree, taught linguistics, and tried being a professional painter that finally I decided to go back and study physiology because I had been reading that all along. So academically, I started fairly late in science, but that was sort of an advantage because it kept me from having to conform to the dogmas that rule the scientific world.

**Andrew Murray:** You have extensively lectured and taught at universities, and you have many specialties. Would you briefly outline your particular interests?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone, thyroid, aging, and for the last 10 or 20 years, I've been thinking a lot about carbon dioxide and its physiology.

## Elevation and Longevity

**Andrew Murray:** That is what we're going to talk about this month. I know that for some time now, I've been made aware that we are slowly evolving and retraining our minds. My mind certainly has been retrained, Dr. Peat, since I left university. Our physiology and pathology training was very much dictated by the texts at the time, and quite a lot of that seems to be erroneous. You've opened our eyes to certain things that are actually very different.

Let's start with elevation. What does high elevation do for a person? We all know about communities that are famous for having populations with great longevity. How does elevation confer longevity to a human?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the essence of the problem: what is the outstanding feature that affects all of the high populations? 100 years ago, insurance companies already knew—the actuaries were looking at the mortality figures for different diseases—that cancer, for example, was much less common in all of the high cities of the world.

As recently as the 1950s, [scientists] were sure that those figures must be wrong because they knew radiation causes cancer, and the radiation in Denver is much higher than in New Orleans, for example. But the figures show that the cancer rate in New Orleans and San Francisco is much higher than in Denver. They said that just must be a mistake, but the insurance companies have had the figures for over 100 years.

Part of the thing is that the radiation that you get at high altitudes is less harmful because of its lower energy transfer; high-energy cosmic rays basically go through you without causing much damage. But the altitude causes the Haldane-Bohr effect. Everyone knows about that in physiology; it explains what happens when you breathe and when the oxygenated hemoglobin reaches your tissues down in the capillaries.

The Haldane-Bohr effect explains the fact that oxygen, when it sticks to hemoglobin, changes the hemoglobin molecule, causing the carbon dioxide to come loose. And when you have a high concentration of carbon dioxide down in your capillaries, the carbon dioxide sticking to the hemoglobin causes the oxygen to come loose and become available to the tissues.

Strangely, there has been almost no research—just maybe a couple of dozen papers—applying that Haldane effect to other proteins. But in the case of hemoglobin, the molecule just happens to be in the right position to transport oxygen and CO2 in the blood. A few people who have tested other proteins find that the Haldane-Bohr effect applies to proteins in general. When there's a lot of carbon dioxide, it basically changes the pH or the isoelectric point of the protein, making it less accessible to oxygen. That in itself is a protection against the attack of oxygen against proteins.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But more than that, the particular group that carbon dioxide sticks to on a protein, such as hemoglobin, is an amino group. Any amino group in your body—whether it's on your DNA, your enzymes, or the so-called hormone receptors—these all contain amino groups. When there's enough carbon dioxide, it will stick to those groups. In the absence of carbon dioxide, other stuff will stick to those, such as glycation. Various free radical fragments of unsaturated fats will tend to stick to those and derange the hormones. Insulin, for example, is a different hormone in the presence of CO2 versus in the absence of CO2. So everything in your body is different when it's well saturated with CO2. You can't suffer the side effects of diabetes, for example, if your proteins are well protected.

## CO2, Oxygen, and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** I find this yet another example of reorganizing my mind to get to grips with the fundamentals. I think we all think about carbon dioxide as being the "bad guy." It's a bit like the common misconception that sugar is the bad guy or saturated fats are the bad guy. How does carbon dioxide confer more benefits than oxygen when we all think that oxygen is the life-giving molecule?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1940, someone did a survey of organisms, including a great variety of bacteria and amoebas that all require oxygen to live. He found that they can't live more than one generation if they aren't exposed to adequate carbon dioxide. Even the obligate respiring, oxygen-dependent organisms need carbon dioxide. So he concluded that really it's more important as a life-supporting element than oxygen is, because all organisms require it and not all organisms require oxygen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, Dr. Peat, you explained to us just a few minutes ago how if you increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, that tends to knock those oxygen molecules off the hemoglobin so that the tissues can pick up the oxygen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For example, in the heart, when you increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood, you increase the actual amount of oxygen in the heart. It delivers the oxygen to the heart. But more important than that is that it delivers it in the optimum way. It makes the oxygen go to the right places in the heart because it's having the same effect on the heart proteins that it has on the hemoglobin. It retracts the electrons so the oxygen doesn't stick where it shouldn't. The electrons go directly to the oxygen down the electron transport chain, and the electrons are prevented from deviating and attacking the polyunsaturated fats, which is what causes the bad oxidation that people take antioxidants for.

**Andrew Murray:** That's the free radical damage that people know about? So free radical damage is where the electrons are free to interact with things that cause harm, whereas the presence of an increased amount of CO2 actually prevents those electrons from becoming wild and reacting with tissues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The essential electron-moving cofactor, NAD and NADH, which takes electrons from sugar or fat and moves it to the respiratory system—in the presence of carbon dioxide, that is more oxidized, meaning that the oxygen is doing its work better in the presence of CO2.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, just to recap for our listeners: CO2 is referring to carbon dioxide. We breathe in oxygen-rich air and our hemoglobin picks up that oxygen and carries it to our tissues. What is happening at higher elevations is that you have an increased amount of carbon dioxide in relation to the amount of oxygen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is less oxygen pressure pushing the carbon dioxide out of your body, so your body retains a higher concentration as you go higher in altitude. You can see that in the cornea; it becomes more compact at higher altitude. People often notice that their nearsightedness improves by two or three diopters.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow. I read an article that you published explaining how nocturnal cornea edema can result in swollen eyes because the cornea has to absorb oxygen from the air. When we're awake, our eyes are open and that diffusion is happening, but at nighttime, our eyelids are closed and our cornea swells because it's not able to get oxygen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They've done experiments putting goggles over people and infusing extra carbon dioxide into the goggles. That makes the oxygen get used more efficiently in the cornea where it's depending on the outside for its energy supply. The carbon dioxide helps the oxygen get in and tightens up the energy structure of the cornea.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why are hospitals so concerned, especially in emergency rooms, with testing your oxygen saturation and giving you oxygen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For one thing, I've tested those meters on my finger. Everyone feels really good when they have a 99% saturation, but I've noticed that when I'm feeling really the best, I can get mine down to 89%. I've watched the different conditions that cause it. Hyperventilating will cause the saturation to go up. Having cold fingers will make the oxygen go up. If you're not using the oxygen, it doesn't do you any good to have your hemoglobin saturated. So those finger meters aren't really very informative unless you know what temperature your fingers are at.

I've talked to doctors specializing in giving oxygen to stroke patients. Way back in the 1930s, Yandell Henderson became famous for providing resuscitation equipment to fire departments which provided 7% carbon dioxide with the oxygen. That was based on physiology. It worked the same for altitude sickness. I have friends now who take a bottle of carbon dioxide with them when they go to Vail for high-altitude skiing. When they start getting mountain sickness, they take some carbon dioxide. Traditionally, people have been using acetazolamide for altitude sickness; that causes you to retain your own carbon dioxide at a higher level.

## Exercise, Lactic Acid, and Stress

**Andrew Murray:** Let's go over the health benefits of increasing your CO2, either artificially or when you live at high altitude. I understand it's the inflammatory reactions inside the body that are controlled by an increase in carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you've ever hyperventilated just for fun, sometimes it'll make your hands drop into a cramp or make your toes curl up. Losing carbon dioxide when you hyperventilate is the same as living at a very low altitude. There's too much oxygen and too little carbon dioxide. The cramping effect is just the first immediate thing. It also causes a cramping of your blood vessels, shutting down the diameter of your blood vessels, and it can cause fainting by cutting off the blood supply to your brain.

But it also causes the capillaries to leak. Even though they're tending to close down, they also become leaky and let water leak out. Carbon dioxide at the proper concentration causes the platelets to retain their histamine, serotonin, and other inflammatory substances. When you hyperventilate, your platelets leak these and make your blood vessels leak, causing edema.

If you have something else causing lactic acid to increase other than hyperventilation, you get the same effect. The lactic acid displaces the carbon dioxide, makes your platelets and red blood cells leak, and starts the inflammation cycle. One of the ways that carbon dioxide works is that it combines with ammonia, which is produced by stress and protein metabolism. In combining with the ammonia, it stops the stimulation of the formation of lactic acid. Ammonia accelerates the formation of lactic acid, so carbon dioxide is directly turning off the production of lactic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** Lactic acid is the thing that we feel when we exercise and our muscles cramp.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And it triggers the release of a whole series of mediators of inflammation, also of fibrosis. They're now finding that during abdominal surgery, if they blow in a fairly concentrated carbon dioxide gas, they'll suppress the formation of fibrosis and adhesions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the common belief that when your muscles hurt it means that they're growing bigger and that's better is a myth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, yeah. Anything that injures your muscle... the lactic acid is probably long gone, but the damage persists. The damage involves the loss of CO2, and that causes the uptake of water, swelling, and so on. The swelling and injury does cause the muscle to get bigger, but not healthier.

**Andrew Murray:** This is another misconception regarding athletes. We look at people doing the Olympics and imagine them to be the most supreme, fit human beings, yet actually, they're in a very stressful state doing what they do.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There have been studies that found that very well-trained athletes typically go around with an elevated lactic acid in their blood. Even days after their last exercise, they've suppressed their carbon dioxide and become habituated to increased lactic acid, which has those long-range harmful effects.

## Oxygen Therapy and Immune Function

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wanted to ask you, Dr. Peat, why people who go to oxygen clinics and have intravenous oxygen or oxygen therapy feel positive health effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are different treatments called oxygen therapy. They range from simply injecting a solution of hydrogen peroxide or exposing the blood to ozone or ultraviolet light. Generally, the treatments are exciting the white blood cells. Some of the effects of excited white blood cells are beneficial; they become more aggressive when they're slightly injured. But they also release substances that trigger the stress hormones, ACTH, leading to activation of your adrenals. Activated adrenals will combat other inflammations. So it's a way of turning on your anti-inflammatory, anti-stress hormones. But there are better ways to just generally suppress your inflammatory responses. For example, things that increase progesterone will decrease cortisol, causing much better consequences in the long run.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people might experience an increased immune system or decreased inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Carbon dioxide activates the phagocyte process of various cells in your blood. That's a part of normal repair and regeneration. For example, the baby gestating in the uterus is completely free of germs normally, but it still has very active phagocytes. Their activity is supported in proportion to the carbon dioxide tension, which is usually high in the uterus. That activity of the phagocytes is part of the developmental process. When a tissue is changing from one form to another, the old form has to be digested and removed to make room for the new form.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the phagocytes will eat up the old cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and so the high concentration of carbon dioxide supports the developmental process of cleaning up the junk.

**Andrew Murray:** Would any of this phagocytosis be involved in destroying cancer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's essential. Lacking the cells enter the cancer, but they are unable to produce the right results because the cancer is producing lactic acid which knocks out the suppressing [effect] coded by carbon dioxide.

Also scar formation. The developing fetus is practically resistant to forming scars. Only at a later stage, when it's being exposed to environmental fats that the mother eats, will it form a scar. But healing is ordinarily scarless in the early fetus. It's the things causing loss of carbon dioxide mostly that inhibit the phagocytes, which should clean up the collagen excess.

**Andrew Murray:** Is it in part due to the decreased fibrosis that increased CO2 would also bring about, leading to less scars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that's a big part of it. Excess oxygen causes malfunction of a lot of things. Displacing the carbon dioxide changes everything systematically.

## CO2 Baths and Treatments

**Andrew Murray:** It reminds me of a spring that we have here in California called Vichy Springs in Ukiah. Those mineral-rich spring waters are highly carbonated. You get this thing called reactive hyperemia after you've been in the water about five minutes where you get this flushing; your skin turns pink and you feel warm, even though the water is only about 96 degrees.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a giant plastic bag, like a leaf bag, you can fill it with pure carbon dioxide. It'll be at room temperature or even colder if you just blew it out of a tank. When you step into that, you instantly feel warmth and your skin turns pink. When you're in a hot spring, even though the water doesn't dissolve a very high concentration of CO2, still you absorb it against a gradient. There can be many times higher concentration of CO2 in your tissue, but it moves from a lower concentration into your body as if your body were pumping it in. But it's really a matter of being more soluble in your body.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think you're getting more benefits from CO2 by bathing in Vichy or sitting in a trash bag full of CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's more fun to bathe in a hot spring.

**Andrew Murray:** I know. But actually, from a standard point of view, do you think you're probably going to get more CO2 doing a CO2 therapy in a sealed container?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. Just don't put it above your neck.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Don't try to breathe it.

## Caller: Asthma and Altitude

**Andrew Murray:** I think we have a caller.

**Caller:** I have a question. How come when people have weakened lungs, high altitude bothers them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's really the only condition that is bad for a high altitude. When they've done studies, for example in New Mexico, mortality from heart disease as well as cancer decreases for every thousand feet of higher altitude. But asthma is the one condition which is a problem at higher altitude.

However, in Mexico City, there have been surveys through Mexico in which actual incidence and suffering from asthma increases as you go *down* in altitude. So if you have asthma to start with, you don't want to go to Leadville right away. But as a matter of developing the problem, living at a high altitude makes you much less likely to develop it than living at sea level.

## Caller: Mountaineering and Bag Breathing

**Andrew Murray:** Let's go to the next caller. You're on the air.

**Caller:** Good evening. I have a question about mountaineering in the 6,000 to 8,000-foot range, maybe even up to 11,000 feet. Normally we use a technique of a big abdominal exhale when we're feeling the effects of the altitude. But what you're saying is you should breathe into a bag instead and breathe in your own CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On one of the Everest expeditions, they were treating people by putting them in a big plastic bag with oxygen. That's a fairly standard way to treat them, and it works. But they found that it was the carbon dioxide that they were breathing out that was accumulating in the bag, which was the really therapeutic agent.

**Caller:** So that would be a good technique to test? To have a paper sack or plastic bag and exhale into it and take maybe 30 seconds of deep breaths into it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. I've seen people with high blood pressure bring their blood pressure down 30 points in a day or two just by bag breathing repeatedly.

**Caller:** Okay, well, thank you. We'll try that this winter.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, Dr. Peat, you've mentioned before that if you tightly seal the bag around your mouth, you can breathe in and out of that bag for a couple of minutes before you start to feel uncomfortable. Just that small amount of bag breathing can increase your carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. How the adaptation works is that each time you increase the CO2 to an uncomfortable level, it's suppressing the lactate a little bit and lowering the adrenaline, free fatty acids, and many things that cause you to hyperventilate. So you're basically curing your tendency to breathe too much by adapting to repeated exposures to extra CO2.

## Thyroid, Metabolism, and Exercise Types

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to bring out a little bit about people with low thyroid. I understand that their CO2 state is generally lower anyway because they have an increased adrenaline, and adrenaline depresses carbon dioxide. So having a better thyroid will increase your likelihood of retaining CO2 and decrease your adrenaline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and there are many side paths to that. For example, the thyroid helps to lower the estrogen level. Estrogen and many of the related factors tend to cause you to hyperventilate, even to the point of having alkalosis. Diabetes, even though supposedly the diabetic isn't using glucose, typically a diabetic has elevated lactic acid. Carbon dioxide makes a big effect on the diabetic lactate.

**Andrew Murray:** This is another reason not to aerobically exercise—running, jogging, cycling—things that would increase your respiration, increase your oxygen, decrease your CO2, and increase your adrenaline. All of those things are pointing out to be more negative than healthful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** So the kind of exercises for people that do exercise a lot... what would be more beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think mild muscle-building activity, as well as anything that's fun—enjoyable activity that doesn't cause discomfort. There have been studies of old people with their muscle mitochondria apparently having genetic damage and loss of DNA. By several weeks of concentric exercise—just contracting the muscle against resistance—they repaired the mitochondrial DNA to have restored mitochondrial function. But the eccentric exercise, where your muscle is forced to lengthen while resisting—for example, when you're walking down a hill—that damages the mitochondria.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this is why you suggest pushing the bicycle up the hill and riding the bicycle down the hill. Or throwing weights or loading firewood.

## Long-Term Benefits of Altitude

**Andrew Murray:** I didn't know this, but the positive effects of elevation—say if you go up to a high city for a couple of weeks and come down—can actually linger for several months. How does that work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Russians were the ones that really pioneered this. After Yandell Henderson, the Russians took up the study and found that if an animal was kept at high altitude for a few months, when it went back to low altitude, it lived the rest of its life retaining about twice as many mitochondria as it had at lower altitude. Meaning it was basically twice as efficient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And it could produce twice as much energy. For those listening, the mitochondria are the powerhouses that utilize fuel and produce energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And it's failure of the mitochondrion that causes the degenerative diseases. Otto Warburg, 80 or 90 years ago, was showing that mitochondria fail in cancer. The same Russian groups that were showing that high altitude causes increased mitochondria produced cancers artificially in rats. The ones that were left at low altitude, 100% of them died. The others that were taken to 17,000 feet, 50% of them spontaneously threw off the cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow. The beach and the seaside in Victorian England was the place to go to, but actually, it's one of the worst things you can do. You need to go to a high elevation if you want to get some positive effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you tell us, Dr. Peat, about those people that live at very high altitudes and their lifespans? You were telling me about a typical lifespan of 130 to 150 years old.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think it was about 1950, the first time I heard about it was a Peruvian who was brought to tour the United States as an oddity. The church record showed him as being 187 years old. After a couple of weeks visiting around the US, he was sent back to Peru and died shortly after that. And Old Parr in London—he was a guy in the country that was famous for being 150-something. The King had him brought to London to study, and he died shortly after living the high life in London.

**Andrew Murray:** At sea level?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My mother and I just went to Michoacán in Mexico. We were staying in Pátzcuaro, which is a town at 7,200 feet. For the short seven days we were there, the health benefits were very noticeable. Dr. Peat, you're suggesting that if someone spends a week to a month at a higher elevation, the health benefits will last. For how long?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After once, probably a year and a half, something like that. A friend of mine who was there at that altitude last winter for almost two months lost 20 pounds while he was there.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That was the other thing. Their food is so delicious—their wonderful corn tamales, uchepos, and corundas. I ate probably two to three times more than I normally eat, and I came back weighing the same. My mother did the same. We were so hungry, it sped up our metabolism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Indian army noticed that their soldiers, when they were sent to Kashmir or other very high-altitude places, lost weight very quickly. So they've done a lot of studies on how to keep the soldiers' weight up at high altitude.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We hiked up this ancient volcano every morning, and that was a two-hour hike. We didn't notice any change in our breathing as far as being at 7,200 feet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The conventional physiologists for years have noticed what they called the "lactate paradox," which is that you can work full force at a high altitude without producing lactic acid. It's not really a paradox; it's that the oxygen is not at a high enough concentration to displace carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide is taking care of the lactic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** So in increased carbon dioxide states, oxygen is utilized way more efficiently and way less of it is available to react in free radical formation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It works one of the ways is that carbamino effect, simply protecting any amino group from attack by oxygen. But it also simply activates the enzymes that direct the electrons to move from glucose or fat down to oxygen. It creates a sort of greased pathway for the electron movement. If you block the carbon dioxide or oxygen, the NAD reflects the increased access to electrons, and those electrons tend to diffuse out through the cell, causing attack of polyunsaturated fats and genetic material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, the carbon dioxide is acting like a very powerful antioxidant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Instead [of antioxidants], hospitals have noticed that during surgery their patients often had severe lung damage from free radical oxidation from ventilating them too hard. So now they practice what they call "permissive hypercapnia." They under-respirate them, let the carbon dioxide accumulate, and it has an antioxidant protective effect.

In horses, there were studies in which they raised the blood carbon dioxide concentration three times normal. At that level, there were no free radicals detectable in their bloodstream, where normally there is a certain amount. It's as though we're designed to live with much more carbon dioxide than is available at this altitude.

People studying the early embryo before implantation traditionally were culturing them in an atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide and maybe 15 or 20% oxygen, and they were having poor results. Someone tried increasing the CO2 and found that at 10 or 15% CO2 and 5% oxygen—much more CO2 than oxygen—the blastocysts were more vigorous. More of them survived and implanted better. So even at the crucial stage of early embryo development, carbon dioxide is the crucial factor, much more important than oxygen.

## Dietary Fats: PUFAs vs. Saturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** Are there any good ways of increasing your CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Shifting your diet away from the polyunsaturated fats is, I think, the basic [step].

**Andrew Murray:** How does that help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The polyunsaturated fats interfere with the enzymes that send electrons to oxygen and shift away from glucose metabolism to fat metabolism. You can show that when they give intravenous fat to people in hospitals to increase their calories, within a few minutes their ability to use glucose is suppressed. The fats simply block the enzymes that produce the oxidized glucose.

When you burn glucose, you get much more carbon dioxide per unit of oxygen used. So at high altitude, a person uses their oxygen more efficiently and they're more reluctant to burn their stored fats. Anything you do to increase the carbon dioxide will tend to protect you against mobilizing your fats and creating that diabetes-like state.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to explain for our listeners, polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) are those fats that are liquid at room temperature—apart from olive oil, which is mainly monounsaturated. They include the long list of vegetable oils: soy, canola, safflower, cottonseed, corn, sunflower, hemp seed, flaxseed, and fish oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There is a big push now to sell fish oils in place of those seed oils that were promoted for 50 years. Now they're shifting over to fish oils because they don't produce some of the toxic effects of the seed oils. But part of the reason they don't do that is that they are so unstable that they break down even before they reach your bloodstream. A very high proportion has become the free radical fragments that inhibit your immune system. Even though in the long range they increase your infections and suppress immunity, in the short range they seem to be anti-inflammatory just by their suppressive effect.

Some of the people who are promoting those very oils, DHA and EPA, have been saying that your baby will be smarter if you put it in their baby food. But in the baby food, these things are so unstable, they're about 20 times more broken down into toxic free radicals than even when you get them in the normal food form.

Some of these people believed that the women who ate fish oil and the other highly unsaturated fats would have more intelligent fetuses. So they presented sounds to the gestating baby to see how quickly they could habituate and respond. They were predicting that the women with the highly unsaturated babies would have the smartest fetuses. They found just the opposite: the women showing evidence of a deficiency of fatty acids had the babies that behaved most adaptively.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they had a deficiency of these toxic fatty acids.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And when the baby was born, they measured their head circumference, length, and weight, and they were growth retarded as well as behavior retarded.

**Andrew Murray:** Oh, goodness.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 30 or 40 years ago, animal studies showed the same effect. They fed one group of rats cocoa butter and another safflower oil. The ones that got safflower oil were stupid and had small brains; the others were better learners with bigger brains that had the cocoa butter.

## Engineer's Question: History of Vegetable Oils

**Andrew Murray:** I think our engineer has a question for you, Dr. Peat.

**Engineer:** I have a couple. One is, prior to 1920, I heard that when corn oil got out in the country, there were more heart attacks. I don't know if that's true or not. And the other is butter and coconut oil—are those two ones I should be eating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you eat lots of butter or cream, it can make you fat, but it is protective against the oxidative degenerative diseases. But the coconut oil tends to stimulate your use of oxygen so fast that it protects against even obesity. Milk contains other things that stimulate your safe use of oxygen, so if you're going to use the cream, it's better with milk rather than just in the butter form.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And I think your question about the heart attacks was that prior to the 1920s, studies showed that heart attacks were much less prevalent. It was once people started eating these polyunsaturated fats in the corn oil—the big Mazola corn oil push—that's when the heart attack incidence was on the increase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And the age pigment is formed from the polyunsaturated fats of corn oil and soy oil. This has been identified repeatedly in the atherosclerotic plaques that are involved in heart disease. So there are direct connections between the polyunsaturated fats and heart disease as well as cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There's lots of this research out there. You can visit Dr. Ray Peat's website. It's www.raypeat.com.

**Andrew Murray:** There are plenty of articles there about subjects that we've talked about this evening and a lot of other articles that we haven't covered, but well worth checking out. Fully referenced scientific articles. Thank you for listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. Until next month, August the 20th.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
