## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's and this New Year's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. Happy New Year everybody. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, I'm a licensed naturopathic doctor who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where I consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of digestion and emotion. Some of it is carrying on from last month's topic of "You Are What You Eat." I had quite a few people writing afterwards on that subject, so thank you for that feedback.

Let's introduce Dr. Peat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us again. I want to give people the benefit of understanding your professional and academic background for those who have just tuned in.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After working several years in humanities areas, I decided to study biology because I wanted to get a concrete grasp of how the brain works in making language, images, and so on. I intended to work on a PhD at the University of Oregon starting in 1968 in brain biology. I quickly found that that was the most dogmatic area in biology—genetics and nerve biology. So, I looked around for less dogmatic areas and it turned out that the extreme other end of the organism, the reproductive system, happened to be the most scientific and empirical. I did my dissertation on oxidative changes in the female reproductive system with aging, and that involves a lot of nutrition-related topics that were of interest to me.

**Andrew Murray:** At one time you were actively consulting with people for quite a few years, weren't you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In the 70s, I happened to meet some women who were having hormonal problems in graduate school. I had talked to some girls who, immediately when they came to the university and got a cheap basement apartment, started having terrible PMS. In 1967 or '68, I got interested in the role of light in brain and hormone functions and what I called "winter sickness" from a light deficiency.

When I started running into women in slightly older groups—40, 45, and 50—having really serious problems like multiple sclerosis and other nerve-related conditions, I recognized the work I had been doing with hamsters and hormones as being directly applicable to them. So I started doing nutritional consulting and finally started suggesting that they use progesterone and thyroid supplements because, in some cases, the diet just wasn't enough to take care of acute problems.

## Digestion, Peptides, and Emotion

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to carry on partly from last month's topic on "You Are What You Eat" and take a more focused look at diet, digestion, and emotion. You mentioned previously that a gut peptide called cholecystokinin (CCK) was shown to have a crucial role in mediating the effects of fatty acids on brain activity. They were saying that the receptors for CCK are known not only for their role in digestion but also for roles in memory function, learning, and the modulation of panic and anxiety.

So, the gut is not just for digestion; it also triggers emotive events. What do you infer from the suggestion that CCK's role in the stimulation of bile and the absorption of fats supports a link between mental function and digestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's good to consider at least one other digestive peptide: the Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP). My general picture of the organism is analogous to the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system—the day and the night sides of the nervous system. Everywhere you look, you can see this polar opposition in two kinds of function. One is mobilizing, the other is demobilizing and relaxing.

**Andrew Murray:** The parasympathetic is the relaxing and the mobilizing is the sympathetic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. When the organism is young and healthy, that opposition works very nicely for night and day action and rest cycling. In the digestive system, when you eat fats and proteins, you secrete cholecystokinin (CCK). When you eat sugar, you secrete GIP, which is also called the insulinotropic hormone because it calms down and stops your acid digestion—you don't need acid to handle sugar—but it activates the insulin so that you handle the sugar.

When you look at the effect in the brain, CCK activates the corticotropin-releasing hormone, which turns on anxiety and stress, and the pituitary ACTH, which turns on the adrenals to handle stress.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide responding to glucose has pretty much the opposite effects. In the hippocampus, for example—which is a part of the brain that's expanded by opportunity and learning and shrunken by stress—the insulinotropic hormone responding to sugar also has receptors that stimulate the birth of new cells. So learning, stimulating experience, and eating sugar go hand in hand.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Surprisingly, the effects on your brain from eating fat and protein turn on anxiety and stress.

**Andrew Murray:** Even protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, that tends to lower your blood sugar because it also stimulates insulin. Lowering the blood sugar turns on stress.

## Bacteria, Endotoxin, and Starch

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Farther down the intestine, if you could be born without bacteria—they've created situations with cesarean birth of rats, dogs, and pigs, keeping them in a germ-free environment—they find that everything develops perfectly. In fact, the animals live longer and are very resistant to obesity, diabetes, and degenerative diseases.

**Andrew Murray:** They have a very high metabolic rate too, don't they?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they're very much like the calorie-restricted animals. On fat-free diets where they don't have the so-called "essential fatty acids," those animals have an extremely high metabolic rate too. So, calorie restriction and being free of germs both stimulate your ability to oxidize food, produce energy, prevent obesity, and be generally healthy and long-lived.

Something is happening in the intestine that the bacteria are responsible for. It turns out the main thing the bacteria are doing is usually converting starch. Starch is the main bacteria-promoting food. The bacteria living on these foods that we don't digest produce endotoxin. The endotoxin, everywhere it reaches a human cell, stimulates the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is on the demobilizing side of the balance. It turns off metabolism and slows down oxidation. It is the main reason that having too many bacteria in the intestine creates obesity, lethargy, and short life.

**Andrew Murray:** Is it all forms of starch that will promote the endotoxin production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they're very well cooked, easy to digest, and aren't complex with fibrous material, it is different. For example, a corn tortilla that had been processed in alkali to open up the starch granules makes them easy to digest. Versus the bean carbohydrates—the type of polysaccharide that human enzymes can't work on are ideal for feeding bacteria, hence all the gas.

When they've experimented with rats on this type of soluble indigestible fiber, the ones that get the fiber that supports the bacterial growth become anxious and aggressive. They're fearful and so they fight too easily.

## The Dangers of Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** I'm glad you brought up nitric oxide. I think just like sugar was demonized and polyunsaturated fats were promoted, nitric oxide is now being promoted. L-arginine, which nitric oxide is manufactured from, is becoming a popular supplement, especially in the bodybuilding world. Publications are claiming it is important for endothelial health to prevent stroke and angina. Yet there's so much evidence contrary to that. Why is nitric oxide so dangerous? I know it's been implicated in stroke in people that use Viagra, for example.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I just recently heard about a doctor who treats cancer patients with intravenous arginine. Just before I heard about him, I had been reading way back to the 1940s where people discovered that arginine stimulates cancer growth and that starvation or reduction of arginine stops cancer growth. Through the 50s and 60s, methods to stop the conversion of arginine to nitric oxide were investigated as a way to cure cancer.

So there are these two very opposite things going on. One side proposes nitric oxide to cure cancer, while the other demonstrates that suppressing nitric oxide stops the growth of cancer.

I happened to be interested in endogenous carbon monoxide in the early and mid-80s; it can promote cancer by blocking the respiratory enzymes. Then in the late 80s, people started realizing that something was producing nitric oxide in the body. In 1988 or '89, the enzyme was demonstrated. We actually have the enzyme that makes this smog-like free radical in our tissues. Because it was already known as a major toxin in smog, people immediately investigated what it's really doing in the body.

From about 1990 up until the mid-90s, there were many publications showing that nitric oxide produced in the pancreas kills insulin-producing beta cells. That was massively documented up until about 1996. Then the Viagra people got a patent and started promoting the idea that somehow nitric oxide is associated with virility. Suddenly, the research by the late 90s turned 180 degrees, saying everything nitric oxide does must be wonderful.

**Andrew Murray:** Am I right in thinking also that nitric oxide in smog is a causative agent for asthma?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There are people recommending arginine and breathing nitric oxide to treat asthma, but others demonstrate that people with asthma are producing it themselves—you can measure it in their breath. The worse their asthma is, the more nitric oxide comes out in their breath. It's the same with hepatitis, cancer, or any major systemic disease. You can find increased amounts of nitric oxide-related chemicals in the blood.

**Andrew Murray:** Nitric oxide is produced in the body and supposedly has beneficial functions. What is its real benefit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It helps cells to dedifferentiate by blocking their energy production. If you think of the mitochondrial high-energy oxidative system as being what creates a complex organism, if you want to dedifferentiate and produce a stem cell, you knock out the energy production and it goes back to becoming amoeba-like or fungus-like.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is like stem cell recruitment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When a tissue is injured, it secretes a great burst of nitric oxide. That calls up stem cells from the environment, but it also creates them—it dedifferentiates existing cells in adjoining tissues so that they can form whatever new tissue is needed. So dedifferentiation is part of forming the organism in the first place. As the embryo develops, nitric oxide has a constructive role. And for wound healing, it's essential.

But that very same burst that calls up repair cells, if it doesn't have the ability to be turned off, keeps differentiating and stimulating tissue renewal so that you get an unhealing wound. The least bad example would be a keloid scar tissue that just keeps growing. In the worst case, it becomes a tumor and a cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you control nitric oxide so that it's a proportionate response to injury but blocked otherwise?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything that we have that is involved in producing oxidative energy helps to turn it off. Vitamin B1, niacinamide, the anti-inflammatory things like progesterone and pregnenolone, thyroid hormone—all of the differentiating, mobilizing, energy-intensifying substances turn it off. Everything that interferes with those turns it on and keeps it going.

Going into hibernation, an animal produces these demobilizing signals with nitric oxide. Anything that makes the organism tend to give up and stop struggling—demobilizing because of stress or isolation—powerfully turns on nitric oxide. In brain function, when your brain is being turned off, it experiences depression and wants to retreat.

**Andrew Murray:** And things like anxiety and aggression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You aggress if someone doesn't let you retreat.

## Mind-Body Connection and Learned Helplessness

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask you about the mind-body connection. Through focused attention and positive thinking, can the physical body be improved? Would you use supplements (progesterone, thyroid, B vitamins) to turn this negative cascade off, or would you have a positive mental outlook? Do you see the two being important together?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at the example of the psychologists who create depression by torturing animals—convincing them that they can't escape—once they form the idea that they can't escape, they don't try to escape anymore. It's an intellectual switch that happens from the bad experience. If you have made an animal helpless by those experiences, just one experience of escape will cure it.

**Andrew Murray:** It'll have the knowledge.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It's resistant because of that knowledge. The culture is telling people too often that they can't escape, that they have to do what they do. So something as simple as taking a vacation or getting a new job can make a tremendous difference. A person can pop right out of a prolonged depression if they get a new kind of work, for example.

## Caller: Arimidex and Histamine

**Andrew Murray:** We've got the first caller of the evening. Caller, you're on the air.

**Caller (Kansas City):** My question for Dr. Peat is: do you think using low-dose Arimidex as an aromatase inhibitor would be appropriate for a female who is correcting her metabolic rate by a thyroid diet but still has a fair amount of fat to lose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those chemicals all have some side effects, so there are much better ways to turn off estrogen production. Just the endotoxin from bacteria is a powerful promoter of aromatase and estrogen production. So taking an antibiotic, or eating a kind of fiber that doesn't support bacterial growth, or avoiding starches, and eating saturated fats—which have a germicidal effect—can help. Saturated fatty acids are very much like antiseptics as far as the intestinal bacteria go. Just by making those dietary changes, you can make a tremendous impact on your balance between estrogen and cortisol versus the protective progesterone and androgens.

**Caller (Kansas City):** Okay. One more question. Could you explain briefly the mechanisms of histamine and good ways to correct someone who has histamine responses periodically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since I was mentioning the saturated fats, some of the shorter-chain saturated fats in coconut oil have an antihistamine effect. Coffee is a very effective signal to turn off histamine production. Anything that energizes and restores cell function tends to prevent the production of histamine.

**Andrew Murray:** How about sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, definitely. A person wrote a book about histamine about 40 years ago and demonstrated that histamine is produced in every kind of cell in the organism when it's sufficiently stressed. That was before nitric oxide was known. But histamine turns on nitric oxide. So those are probably the two universal stress injury signals.

## Caller: Antibiotics and Beneficial Bacteria

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller (David):** On the last show, you mentioned that tetracycline will kill the harmful bacteria and the beneficial survive. Do we know that for sure? How does it selectively spare the "beneficial"? Also, I've heard there is a symbiotic relationship with certain intestinal bacteria that help absorb nutrients.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the interactions of the intestinal bacteria are too complicated to divide them neatly into beneficial and harmful. In the germ-free animals, they've done experiments introducing a single species of Lactobacillus, and even the supposedly beneficial bacteria will make the germ-free animal susceptible to injury that it wasn't susceptible to before. So it's the context and interaction of the different bacteria. Generally, the healthier a person is, the more sterile their small intestine is.

**Caller (David):** So what do you think of the idea that certain nutrients are absorbed through the actions of so-called beneficial bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there's a little effect there, but I don't think it makes a big nutritional difference. The totally germ-free animals had extremely efficient digestive systems.

**Caller (David):** Is the term "free fatty acids" always referring to polyunsaturated fat, or are there instances where free fatty acids are actually saturated fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They can be either way. Coconut soap is the salt of the saturated free fatty acids. If you actually could eat a bite of free fatty acids, it would taste like acidic soap.

## Caller: Infrared Saunas

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller (Kim):** I was wondering what the effect of infrared sauna would have on the cells' mitochondria. It produces nitric oxide, doesn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Water absorbs infrared very powerfully. Real infrared feels warm and it helps to keep your body temperature up. Keeping your body temperature up is essential for the mitochondria. The stress of cold is enough to turn on nitric oxide and that can start down the pathway of hibernation. So infrared, as it keeps your body temperature up, helps your mitochondria.

The far-red visible light—dark red, anywhere from orange to dark red—isn't very well absorbed by water, so it goes right through your tissue. You can see a red light shining through your whole body. That's because it penetrates and is only absorbed by blue. Copper is the main thing that absorbs it—enzymes that contain copper in a blue form. Those happen to be the respiratory enzymes. So the far-red activates the respiratory enzymes. Probably a major reason for that is that it bounces the nitric oxide molecule, loosens it, and frees it from the respiratory enzymes where it has been blocking it.

## Caller: Sprouted Grains and Progesterone for Men

**Andrew Murray:** Next caller, you're on the air.

**Caller (Sacramento):** This is related to treating corn with alkali to make it more digestible. Are sprouted grain tortillas also considered good for digestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. The starch is largely consumed and used. These storage proteins in the seed happen to have lots of ammonia or amino groups which are used to make actual functioning proteins with the energy from the starch. When you sprout a grain, you get rid of the toxic proteins that could release too much arginine and produce nitric oxide and histamine, and you get rid of most of the starches. So sprouts are basically good nutrition, like leaves.

**Andrew Murray:** The gentleman asked if it mattered whether it was wheat or barley.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All seeds, as far as I know, have some toxic effects built in by the plant to protect their offspring. Once the sprouting has begun, the seed detoxifies those intrinsic chemicals. Especially if it's very well cooked, then it becomes nutritious.

**Caller (Sacramento):** One final question. Is progesterone for men beneficial or harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Men who are in good health have a fair amount of progesterone. It's rarely measured in men, but it prevents abnormal excess clotting and it's a precursor for other hormones. If you have a good amount of progesterone, it protects you against fluctuations in the adrenal steroids, aldosterone and cortisol. Progesterone is sort of an all-purpose defensive hormone and it's very highly concentrated in the brain, in men as well as women. So it's definitely not just a female hormone.

But if you have too much of it—if you take a supplement—it opposes testosterone. A man doesn't want to take it regularly and stop his whiskers growing, for example. But for an emergency, a big supplement can be helpful for epilepsy or arthritis.

**Andrew Murray:** How quickly would you metabolize a dose of progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know a doctor who insisted that taking progesterone orally wouldn't show up in the blood. So he took a fourth of a teaspoon and then drew his blood every half hour for 12 hours. He showed that it peaked in around the first hour and then gradually decreased over the next day.

## Caller: Yogurt and Skin Conditions

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller.

**Caller (Garberville):** Is it your opinion that yogurt, for its supposed beneficials, is not so beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it has had some of the lactic acid drained off, or if it has just coagulated without becoming very sour, then it's fine.

**Caller (Garberville):** Is there a difference between a Greek yogurt and a goat milk yogurt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the Greek, which isn't sour, is safe. But the very acidic ones are problematic. I discovered that by drinking a cup of kefir every day, I would get a migraine for several hours afterwards. The type of lactic acid produced by bacteria is racemic. The kind we make is mostly the one confirmation that works differently. The racemic type made by bacteria is more able to produce inflammation and fibrosis if you're chronically overloaded with it.

**Caller (Garberville):** That dovetails into my main question. I was diagnosed with a skin condition called Hidradenitis suppurativa, which causes cysts. I've been trying to support my system with kefir.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have experimented with killing the lactobacillus, and in itself, even when it's dead, it has a very definite anti-inflammatory effect in the intestine. It seems that it isn't the lactic acid or the metabolism of the bacteria that is anti-inflammatory, but just something about the chemistry of the organism, even if it's dead. Since the inflammation in the intestine is quickly reflected in the physiology of the skin, soothing your intestine will take care of a lot of skin conditions, like acne.

**Caller (Garberville):** So yogurt minus the lactic acid is better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Liver, Anger, and Exercise

**Andrew Murray:** From a perspective of Hippocratic medicine, they always mentioned that the liver was the seat of anger. Do you have any comment on how this might come about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver, to the extent that it's injured, will ruin the whole organism. It's the chemist for the whole organism. If you're starving and not getting enough protein or B vitamins, your liver loses the ability to detoxify and you get gross hormone imbalances. That can lead to progressive inflammation and fibrosis.

As these processes get more serious, the liver becomes a larger source of nitric oxide. When they transplant a liver, they've measured the sick person's nitric oxide as very high. When they put in a new liver, suddenly the nitric oxide is low and the lungs begin working more efficiently, demonstrating that the liver is poisoning the lungs.

With the brain, the same thing is happening. Edema is produced in the brain by the endotoxin-nitric oxide combination. The ammonia produced by the injured liver activates the nerves that are excited by glutamic acid (MSG) and excitatory amino acids. Those act largely through nitric oxide. So depression, anxiety, and I assume aggression is part of this mixture of gradual poisoning.

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of exercise, I know you advocate gentle weight-bearing exercise rather than aerobic. What would you suggest as the best food sources for building a healthy physique? You mentioned gelatin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gelatin is at least safe. It doesn't stimulate muscle growth the way other proteins such as meat can do. But the person's history really has to be taken into account. I've known people who ate gigantic amounts of meat and were producing so much cortisol in response to the meat that they had extremely high levels of amino acids in their urine and their muscles were being damaged by that same high level of cortisol.

Ideally, like the germ-free animals, they can run on very little protein and lots of carbohydrate. The carbohydrate gets used for energy and you would assimilate essentially all of the protein that you eat because your cortisol wouldn't be destroying it.

**Andrew Murray:** What kind of carbohydrates? Fruit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. As long as you're getting all of the essential nutrients, for example from some seafoods and eggs, then fruits and gelatin would be a very safe diet for adults.

**Andrew Murray:** Very good. I thank you for your time, Dr. Peat. Dr. Raymond Peat's articles are available at www.raypeat.com. Until the third Friday in February, I wish you a happy New Year. Good night.
