## Introduction: The State of the Pandemic

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome.

**Andrew Murray:** Today is Friday, April 15, 2022. The subject of this month's discourse is COVID: the more you vaccinate, the greater your chance of getting COVID. We'll be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat in just a bit, but I wanted to open the show with a discussion on COVID, authoritarianism, free speech, and disinformation.

An article by Steve Kirsch from April 6, 2022, outlines worldwide reporting—including thorough evaluations done by the governments of Australia, New Zealand, and the UK—showing the fully vaccinated are now infected at triple the rate of the unvaccinated. In the case of the UK Health Security Agency, instead of stopping the vaccines, the UK government stopped the data reporting as the results implied vaccine-driven infections were becoming widespread. The main cause of continuing viral infection appears to be the continued drive to further vaccinate the general public.

Don't take my word for it; check yourself. The vaccines seem to be driving infection amongst the vaccinated, primarily as the unvaccinated get and recover from infection. In the early days of the pandemic, people like Professor Sucharit Bhakdi were warning about repercussions, stating thrombosis and clot formation were likely. Many sudden deaths from this have occurred, especially in the young. Fifteen countries suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine after this was highlighted last year. Both disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous thrombosis were causes.

It seems that all the hype and social control are losing traction as we learn to live with, not vaccinate against, COVID. Cardiomyopathies among the young increased at an alarming rate, along with sudden cardiac arrest, multiple autoimmune syndromes, crippling stroke, and clot formation. But the damage has been done. Are we ready for the next rollout? How many will gladly take the next shot?

Disinformation has been a tactic of warfare since the beginning, but the truth is always present. Dr. Peter McCullough exemplifies this in his tireless crusades to the Senate and governments internationally, along with Dr. Robert Malone, pioneer of the technology used to create the experimental drug. Dr. Peat, you stated this from the beginning also. It's a testimony to you that you were sounding an alarm regarding the fabrication of the infection and death data early in 2020. So where are we now? Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining us. Before I ask you where we are now, would you please outline your academic and scientific background for new listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was working in the humanities—linguistics in particular—for several years before I decided to go back to graduate school. I first intended to concentrate on brain biology, but seeing the dogmatic nature of that department, I looked around for a more scientific part of biology and found reproductive physiology. I did my dissertation on the physiology of aging in the reproductive system, especially oxidative changes with age. Since then, I've been applying those insights to studying brain physiology with a new perspective and working out ways to intervene in the problems of aging and stress.

## Data Manipulation and Economic Shifts

**Andrew Murray:** Getting to the opening part of tonight's discussion, we've spoken at length since March 2020. You were right there saying there was something seriously wrong with the data about infection rates.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Actually, while we're talking about the numbers, Dr. Peat, can you outline what you saw happening with the overall mortality in the first couple of months of 2020?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For a while, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) showed a historically unique drop in the total mortality of the United States during the last months of 2019 into the first few months of 2020. That was very attention-getting. But by the summer, they did another historically unique thing: they went back and revised the numbers. People were asking if they "saved up" and didn't report deaths for several months with the foreknowledge that they would need documentation for a surge of death when the pandemic was declared.

Just as a few of us were predicting that weird historical process, it was revised. I think it was in May or June that the CDC said, "Well, that was mistaken. Every health department in the country was very slow in reporting all the deaths." Then, when we had a huge surge of so-called COVID deaths, those were new and real deaths. But looking at the figures, the very week that the pandemic death surge occurred, it happened again uniquely in history: the annual number of deaths ascribed to influenza—which had been consistent as long as records were kept—suddenly disappeared. Influenza deaths fell off a cliff the very week that the very high death rate was reported for COVID. Anyone who looked at the numbers found it impossible to believe that was a statistical event other than manipulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few people, like James Corbett with the Corbett Report, had already been tracking this. He started with speeches given by Eric Schmidt, formerly of Google, who moved over to the Pentagon on a committee studying artificial intelligence. In the spring of 2019, Schmidt was giving the judgment of his committee, confirming ideas put out around 2010 by the Rockefeller Foundation. Eric Schmidt and the Pentagon essentially said their projections were right: we have to destroy the existing "legacy" economies so that we can install artificial intelligence digital economies to achieve high efficiency and keep the Chinese from dominating the world economy.

James Corbett watched the Federal Reserve and the CEOs of giant corporations taking precautions. You could see the movement in the money; something was about to go haywire in the financial system. It happens that the practice runs for a coronavirus pandemic, which had been acted out in New York in the fall of 2019 (Event 201), were in place, ready to install as soon as they had a real-world event to justify these extreme changes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That pandemic play-out was Event 201 you're referring to, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It was a mock-up of what they would do around the world simultaneously when the coronavirus epidemic hit. They had everything almost exactly as it happened, predicted several months in advance. The plan, going back to the Rockefeller Foundation ten years earlier, was to use that as an excuse to destroy the old economies, allowing digital economies and artificial intelligence to take over. The purpose was to prevent the worldwide financial crisis from hurting the billionaire class.

By destroying middle-class, medium, and small businesses through lockdowns, they destroyed local economies to the extent that people had to shop online. Amazon got a gigantic multi-billion dollar boost in income. Eric Schmidt had said almost a year earlier that this was what they were working toward. It was clear they intended to shift power and wealth from the masses to the billionaire monopoly class.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right, and that's what some people said. Walmart didn't close. All the big chain stores did not close. But the independent shop owners were put out of business.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the billionaires multiplied their wealth hugely. Just a few months ago, it was obvious that people were getting informed about the actual nature of the pandemic and were tired of losing their incomes. The government came up with not just a distraction, but further manipulation of finances. There was an even greater shift of moving wealth from the masses. Everyone who heats their house or drives a car is paying several times more for heat and gasoline. Meanwhile, American oil companies have had a tremendous increase in sales under the pressure of cutting off cheap gas and oil from Russia.

In that one move, US oil companies are enriched while Europe and ordinary people in the US suffer economic shortfalls. The sanctions are taking money away from Americans and giving it to the billionaires and the Russian economy, because Russia found other markets and the price of oil went up.

## Infection Rates Among the Vaccinated

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you've neatly summed up the plan. Getting back to my first question: Steve Kirsch's newsletter outlined results from the UK, New Zealand, and Australian governments showing the fully vaccinated are infected at twice the rate of the unvaccinated. Australia is seeing a 1,700% higher death rate than at the start of the pandemic.

Dr. Malone, the inventor of the mRNA technology, stepped out of the shadows to expose this because these drugs had known side effects—antibody-dependent enhancement, autoimmune diseases, and weakening of the immune system. Now we are seeing the vaccinated repeatedly getting coronavirus infections and forming the largest cohort of people dying. How would you speak to the increasing infection amongst the vaccinated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few virologists have been giving mechanisms that explain it. The German virologist Sucharit Bhakdi has very good videos showing the difference between native immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. Natural immunity, which lasts a lifetime, is completely different from vaccine immunity. Originally, they said the vaccines would produce lifetime immunity, but it has turned out that all vaccines in use last only a short time. It is especially true with the COVID-19 RNA vaccines; they fade out in just a few months.

Dr. Bhakdi explains that you're going backward the more booster shots you take. Natural immunity involves the whole body. Natural infections occur through the skin, inhalation, or ingestion. These routes activate an extremely complex system starting from the surfaces inside the skin, mucous membranes, and the digestive system. There are cascades of reactions ending up with antibodies, but antibodies in natural immunity are just a tiny backup part of the process.

The smallpox vaccine was effective because it was given by scratching the skin with the antigen, activating natural immunity. But doctors looking at records of children whose parents declined vaccination found a stark difference. The kids who avoided the dozens of standard vaccinations had almost no sicknesses during childhood and drastically lower rates of hyperactivity syndromes. The obediently vaccinated kids had frequent respiratory infections and behavior disorders.

For over 100 years, people have studied the effect of injecting anything intramuscularly, especially if it comes with a powerful inflammation producer like aluminum hydroxide. Any irritant injected into the muscle goes directly into contact with nerve axons and blood vessels. Animal experiments show that the antigen is taken up by the nerve axons and transported directly into the cell body in the brain or spinal cord. Microparticles of aluminum hydroxide can be traced very quickly from the injection site into the brain, affecting the disposition of that part of the body to be susceptible to paralysis or injury.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's very interesting regarding the smallpox vaccine being successful because it was scratched into the skin. When we were studying in England, the government microbiologists told us the only successful vaccine in history was the smallpox vaccine. I wonder if medicine will eventually come around to making vaccines like that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the history, one branch of professional medicine wanted to monopolize the business and keep herbalists, homeopaths, and naturopaths out. They got laws passed that gave them a monopoly on injecting things intravenously or intramuscularly. There was no science justifying the need to inject a drug versus giving teas or foods. It was simply a way of monopolizing the administration of drugs, and that carried over to giving vaccines in the worst possible way.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It was job security.

## "It Prevents Severe Illness and Death"

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, how would you respond to someone who has been vaccinated and says, "Well, I might still get COVID, but I won't die from it and the symptoms will be much less severe"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ask for the evidence supporting that. When the CDC saw the vaccine didn't prevent infections or spread, they just said, "Well, it's preventing hospitalizations and death." But they manipulated the figures. At the beginning of the vaccination campaign, they included people who had not been vaccinated in the data. Now, figures from sources like Steve Kirsch are very clear that more people are dying, being hospitalized, and getting sick in proportion to their number of vaccinations.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that was a talking point for Big Pharma?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just a made-up phrase they could repeat hundreds of times until people accepted it as truth.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to make sure people can find Professor Sucharit Bhakdi's work. It is spelled B-H-A-K-D-I.

## Caller Questions: Variants and Long COVID

**Caller 1 (Humboldt):** I wanted to comment on the statement about the vaccinated getting infected more. Since the majority of people are vaccinated, wouldn't the numbers naturally be higher in that cohort? Also, the Omicron variants are bypassing the vaccine, so it makes sense the vaccinated are getting infected. Secondly, I never got vaccinated and I got infected twice—the alpha variant and then delta. I got Long COVID after the first one. Delta was really hard on me. I just want to stress that significant numbers of young, healthy people are getting Long COVID and becoming seriously ill. We shouldn't dismiss it as not a real pandemic.

**Andrew Murray:** I appreciate your level-headed questioning. Regarding the statistics, in our county in Northern California, I don't think we have a fully inoculated public—maybe 56% or 60%. The reports I mentioned from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand show that the vaccinated are disproportionately affected. For example, the Australian report showed a 1,700% increase in hospitalized patients, and 4 out of 5 hospitalized patients are vaccinated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's on top of Australia having very low numbers before they started the vaccine program.

**Andrew Murray:** And the New Zealand Ministry of Health showed the triple vaccinated are now more vulnerable to infection and hospitalization than the unvaccinated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** One thing I want to say to the caller is that the PCR tests have been proven to have false positives, and the rapid antigen tests are fairly inaccurate. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test fine print says you can have a false positive if you've ever been exposed to a coronavirus, such as the common cold. Some of these cases might be misdiagnosed flu. Even Deborah Birx of the CDC said early on that approximately 25% of their COVID cases were influenza-like illnesses. We aren't saying this doesn't kill people—influenza kills people every year—but the data figures don't match up because influenza shouldn't just disappear.

## Caller Questions: Medical Compliance and Unions

**Caller 2:** After the OxyContin scandal, it seems like the American Medical Association, unions, doctors, and nurses would have more power over the pharmaceutical industries. Why do doctors and nurses seem so powerless? Why isn't the union standing up against Big Pharma?

**Andrew Murray:** A lot of it is fear and exerting control over finances by canceling you. It's part of a media-social brainwashing. I wanted to bring up "mass formation psychosis." This is defined as aligning a large part of society to a certain cause where their attention focuses on one small point. It's been used to describe the ascent of Hitler and the Nazification of Germany. For COVID, this took the form of the vaccine narrative and the imperative that governments knew best. Dissenting scientists were vilified. Dr. Peat, what is your opinion on this authoritarian model?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The educational system is increasingly similar to military boot camp. Medical school overworks students and deprives them of sleep, which are effectively brainwashing techniques to get them to conform to the system and not question authority. All formal education has been moving in that authoritarian direction.

Dr. Mattias Desmet's analogy between the virus/vaccine cults and the Nazi cult is very close. Democracies use subtler methods—public relations and propaganda. In WWI, the US had an office of propaganda to convince Americans that Germans were monsters. Democracies get almost as cultish with polarization: the enemy is all evil, and our side is all good. This "manufacture of consent" uses PR and education to keep people from thinking about actual issues, turning it into "us against them."

This builds on pre-existing factors Desmet identified: loneliness, atomization, loss of social bonds, and working at jobs that make no sense, making you feel like your life is devoted to meaningless activity.

## Caller Questions: Vaccines and Tylenol

**Caller 3 (James from Arizona):** My niece was recently vaccinated with MMR and chickenpox at the same visit. She had a temperature within a week, my mom gave her Tylenol, and she had a febrile seizure. Is this more a vaccine problem or a Tylenol problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tylenol has very serious side effects. Prenatal use of Tylenol is associated with an increased risk of autism. It's a matter of toxic effects. Any inflammation during gestation or poisoning by something such as Tylenol will increase birth defects and neurological defects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you think the seizure was from the Tylenol in combination with the MMR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They warn people not to use aspirin before getting vaccinated because aspirin actually defends against the harmful effects of vaccines. But Tylenol is poisonous enough that it doesn't protect very well against the inflammatory damage.
