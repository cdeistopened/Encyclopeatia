## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the show, we run from 7:00 to 8:00 o'clock on the third Friday of each month. From 7:30 until the end of the show, callers are invited to call in with any questions regarding the subject. Dr. Raymond Peat is our guest speaker. Dr. Peat, can I just confirm that you're on the line?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Andrew Murray:** Could you tell our listeners who you are and what your background is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I used to study and teach literature, painting, and humanities. In 1968, I went back to graduate school in biology at the University of Oregon for a PhD in physiology and biochemistry, especially relating to aging and female hormones. Since 1972, I've been studying, writing, and consulting with individuals and doctors.

My dissertation was on the oxidative changes—changes in respiratory chemistry—of uterine tissue in particular, but to some extent the whole organism, and how it changes during aging and how that relates to the infertility of menopause. It turns out that estrogen, rather than being just the "female hormone" as they have called it, is really a stress-related hormone that is equally active and dangerous in men as in women. Those age-related changes and estrogen-related changes can be imitated by things that interfere with cellular respiration, including ionizing radiation. They are offset by a variety of things, especially progesterone and vitamin E.

Much of my attention, especially in the 1970s and 80s, was on how the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in the diet interact with all of these stresses. Aging and excess estrogen, in particular, correspond to the deterioration of polyunsaturated fats by random oxidation. A basic thing to protect against aging and stress is to simply reduce the amount of polyunsaturated fats taken in the diet.

## The David Martin Interview and Patent Analysis

**Andrew Murray:** We are going to start out talking about an interview between David Martin and Reiner Fuellmich regarding the history of the so-called COVID virus and the surrounding patents and financial relations.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Reiner Fuellmich is a German lawyer in both California and Germany who is saying that the state governments are falsifying information relating to the pandemic. He is organizing legal challenges to the lockdowns and other government restrictions. David Martin is a financial advisor; part of his business is advising investment organizations on how to evaluate patents and other intellectual property. He has been analyzing patents in detail for over 20 years and has gone through all of the patents closely related to the virus and vaccine. He has a unique perspective on the legal situation and the historical financial connections through the pandemic.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to give an overview of what Dr. David Martin has exposed. Dr. Martin is the chairman and CEO of a company called M-CAM. Since 1998, they have been the world's largest underwriter of intangible assets used in finance. They monitor innovation happening around the world to monitor the economics of those innovations. They reviewed over 4,000 patents issued around SARS coronavirus and comprehensively reviewed the financing of all the manipulations of coronavirus which gave rise to SARS.

The reported gene sequence, which was reportedly isolated as a "novel" coronavirus, was reviewed against the patent records held by this company as of the spring of 2020. They found over 120 patented pieces of evidence to suggest that the declaration of a novel coronavirus was a fallacy. There was no novel coronavirus. There are countless subtle modifications of coronavirus sequences, but no single identified novel coronavirus.

They found records of sequences attributed to novelty in patents sought as early as 1999. Up to 1999, patent activity surrounding coronaviruses was uniquely applied to veterinary sciences. The first vaccine ever patented for coronaviruses was sought by Pfizer, specifically for the S-spike protein—the exact same thing we have allegedly rushed into invention now. The first filing was January 28, 2000.

Dr. Martin states that Anthony Fauci and the NIAID found the malleability of coronavirus to be a potential candidate for HIV vaccines. SARS is not a natural progression of a genetic modification of coronavirus. In 1999, Anthony Fauci funded research at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, specifically to create an infectious, replication-defective coronavirus targeted at human lung epithelia. A patent application filed on April 19, 2002—before the outbreak in Asia—lays out that they knew the ACE receptor, the ACE2 binding domain, and the S1 spike protein could be synthetically modified in the lab.

In April 2003, the CDC filed a patent on the entire gene sequence of SARS coronavirus, which is a violation of U.S. Code because you cannot patent a naturally occurring substance. They also patented the means of detecting it using RT-PCR. This means they control 100% of the provenance of the virus and its detection.

Dr. Peat, I wanted to get your feedback on what David Martin has outlined regarding the timelines, the laboratories, Fauci's involvement, and how the whole world has been essentially brainwashed into accepting this universal vaccine.

## Transhumanism and the Digital Economy

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people behind this have been talking about ways to mobilize cultural change to get rid of the old economy and force a change to a new digital, artificial intelligence-based economy. Getting ahead of China is one of the arguments, but it's been a theme for well over 10 years. The Rockefeller Foundation put out a publication showing the dreadful alternatives for the world if we don't conform and live online and digitally. They suggest that mere humans are not going to fit into the efficient digital future they are proposing unless they can be modified.

More than 50 years ago, some of these trends were getting organized in the Club of Rome, which said the population of the world has to be reduced. MIT has been a major force in getting the world to believe that everything must be reduced to something that can be controlled and calculated by computers. Norbert Wiener, teaching at MIT, was relegated to insignificance because the government supported the digital approach to reality, leaving humans out of the equation unless they can be modified.

The people currently promoting the vaccine presented the use of nucleic acids in so-called vaccines in terms of "changing the operating system" of the human being. They are talking about turning organisms into something like cyborgs—changing their operating system to solve problems, rather than considering the person as an autonomous, intrinsic being.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask your take on the "Delta variant." Dr. Martin outlined scientifically that there is zero difference; it depends on where you start and stop reading the genome.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a website that has been publishing the exact sequences as mutations happen. They have thousands of variations—very minor changes. You could pick out any one of those thousands of site modifications and say, "This is a new variant." All they have to do is decide to hype one particular thing and call it a new danger.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They're twisting the thoughts and it's propaganda when they talk about these variants. Is that what you're saying, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There are variants all over the world, but the evidence hasn't been established that any one of them specifically correlates to anything different from a common cold. They will look at a person's blood and say they have antibodies relevant to this particular variant, but it is isolated information without context. There is no factual basis for saying this is relevant to the world at large.

## Caller: Sardines and Nucleic Acids

**Caller (Rob):** You were talking about messing up RNA and nucleic acid. I was wondering what you thought about eating sardines as a protective food. I heard that they have a unique calcium compound and are very rich in RNA, DNA, and nucleic acids. Even though they have a bit of PUFA, what is your opinion on sardines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the nucleic acids in all of our foods can reach the bloodstream and can even be incorporated into our cells. However, if it's just from an ordinary organism, our cells generally check the meaning of these stretches of RNA and DNA, and most of them are rejected. Very small amounts of our food nucleic acids can be incorporated into our own genome, but they are simply the instructions for making proteins for sardines, cows, or carrots. There's nothing special or toxic about foreign DNA; most of it is discarded.

But the vaccine RNA and/or DNA is specifically a designer of a harmful, very toxic protein—the spike protein. It is deliberately designed to get into our cells. Once this blueprint for a toxic protein is inside the cell, it has the possibility—as demonstrated by experimenters at Harvard and MIT in vitro—to be reverse-transcribed by the intrinsic enzymes of our cells and turned into DNA. That DNA has the possibility of enduring in the cell after the vaccine RNA has been eliminated.

A Pfizer document of a study done in Japan showed that they knew the RNA and other materials in the vaccine left the site of vaccination quickly, got into the bloodstream, circulated throughout the body, and concentrated in various organs, including the bone marrow and especially the ovaries—exactly the places you don't want endlessly producing a very toxic protein.

## Caller: COVID Statistics

**Caller:** I was looking at the COVID page today. Humboldt is doing fairly well, but there are places in Southern California losing 30 people a day. The smartest thing to do would be not to spread it. Just "don't travel" would be smart advice.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for your comments.

## The Disappearance of Influenza

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, would you quickly speak on the disappearance of influenza? What does that really entail in terms of numbers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The influenza vaccination campaign was very intense, but they were seeing complications. For example, if you were vaccinated for influenza, the following season you were more likely to contract any of the coronaviruses. There was a lot of disillusionment about the influenza virus. The figures had been inflated by the CDC calling it influenza when actually only 10% of the pneumonia cases had influenza as a cause.

They were publishing large numbers of pneumonia deaths ascribed to influenza infection until the second week of April 2020. That week, their influenza deaths went almost to zero. Simultaneously, there was a huge spike in deaths ascribed to COVID. As influenza disappeared from the world, COVID mortality replaced it. Genevieve Briand at Johns Hopkins University, a statistician, did a careful analysis of the cause of death. Even heart disease deaths decreased drastically at the same time influenza disappeared. Now, for over a year, the world has been historically deficient in so-called influenza, and approximately similar numbers of pneumonia cases and deaths are being blamed on COVID. That kind of mysterious substitution is obviously a fabricated change of names.

## Caller: Temperature Drop After Exercise

**Caller (Rob from Missoula):** My body temperatures are pretty normal, about 97.8 to 98.8. But if I go out for a walk or any kind of exercise, regardless of the warmth outside, it will drop 3 or 4 degrees and then come back up slowly over about half an hour. I was wondering what might be going on.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How are you taking your temperature?

**Caller:** I tried it axially and orally just to make sure I wasn't breathing cold air.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it would be good to check your pulse rate at the same time and see what your pulse is doing when your temperature is dropping so much.

**Caller:** I was wondering if it might have to do with glycogen storage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It takes fairly strong exercise to deplete your glycogen to the point that your blood sugar would be very low. But if your liver isn't storing glycogen because of hypothyroidism, for example, then exercise does quickly bring on stress-releasing things like serotonin, which chemically try to put you into hibernation and turn off your heat production.

## Caller: Vertigo in the Elderly

**Caller:** I am interjecting a question about my 79-year-old boyfriend. He woke up yesterday with vertigo—like the whole world is swirling around at 2:00 in the morning. What would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It could be some event in the brain or inner ear, but something that's always important to check is whether there's any bowel disturbance, diarrhea, or discomfort in the abdomen. That can release surges of endotoxin, histamine, and serotonin that cause inflammation in the inner ear and vertigo. I don't think it's good to assume that something like a stroke is involved until you've checked on the condition of the bowel.

**Caller:** He seemed okay the next day. He did get a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and so did I. I don't like the concept of RNA viruses or anti-despiralization of my DNA code.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, thank you. We have to wrap up now.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. For people that have listened to the show, Dr. David Martin wraps it up in about an hour and 15 minutes. He explains exactly what came to be with the drug companies and the patents. Follow the money. Dr. Peat has always said there's been no big uptick in deaths from influenza or COVID and that it's a media-driven conspiracy. Dr. David Martin puts the facts together in a very succinct way. He is not a conspiracist; he is a financial analyst of patents.

You can go to BrandNewTube and type in "A Manufactured Illusion." It was published July 9th. It is an interview with Reiner Fuellmich where he lays out the timeline from 1998 through to now.
