## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** This is the May 15, 2020 edition of the show. We are both licensed medical herbalists with a degree in herbal medicine. Our very esteemed colleague, friend, and mentor, Dr. Raymond Peat, has been joining us for the last 10 to 11 years. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Before I get into the meat of the show, for those who may have never heard your name or read your work, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My graduate school in biology was 1968 to 1972, majoring in physiology and biochemistry, doing a dissertation on reproductive aging and oxidative metabolism. Before that, I was in the humanities—a master's degree with a thesis on William Blake—and taught many humanities courses before specializing in biology.

## COVID-19, Ventilation, and ECMO

**Andrew Murray:** We missed our April show, but back in March, we discussed the beginning of the coronavirus situation. Since then, a friend of ours, a liver surgeon working in Los Angeles, mentioned he had never seen the type of lung damage he was witnessing. He brought up ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) as a possible procedure because patients on ventilators were dying.

I also saw a video by a New York emergency physician, Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who said patients were dying *from* ventilation. He noted that while the radiographic picture looked like pneumonia, it wasn't responding to standard pneumonia treatment. You have always said that blood oxygen saturation around 90% is not a problem and have advocated against forcible oxygenation. This doctor noted patients coming in with blood oxygen levels down to 40%, yet they weren't delirious or in shock. Because hospital policy mandated ventilators, these patients were dying. What is your perception of ventilation being the problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw one doctor recently on the internet stating that 92% saturation was the level at which they would intubate patients. That happens to be the percentage I like to keep myself at as much as possible; I think it's a sign of relaxation and using oxygen efficiently.

Regarding ECMO, it can be a solution if done vein-to-vein. But when they involve an artery, the amount of invasion required to connect a machine to arterial blood is so damaging that they have a very high mortality rate.

A doctor in Germany, Dr. Gattinoni, advocates using only a nasal cannula to give oxygen. He compared two hospitals in Germany. One was doing what everyone is recommending in the U.S. and Europe—intubation and forced respiration—and that hospital had a 60% mortality rate in intensive care. The hospital trying his method—just a nasal cannula—had 0% mortality.

One survey found that in 88% of the hospitals they checked, 88% of the patients were dying in the intensive care unit. Some hospitals had 100% mortality in intensive care when they ventilated. Until the 1940s, a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen was available for resuscitation, but unsupported theories of respiration knocked that out. It is very rare now to see the use of carbon dioxide or to even question the idea of pumping oxygen in.

**Andrew Murray:** The article I read stated that the membranes of the alveoli are some of the most fragile in the body, so forcing oxygen under pressure is irrational. It seems it takes death for thinking people to question standard medical care. Dr. Kyle-Sidell mentioned that using a nasal cannula and "proning"—getting patients to lie on their stomachs—brought oxygen levels from 40% up to 80-90%, which is acceptable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even putting them in a prone posture rather than supine makes a big difference. A few doctors have mentioned the oddity of this so-called pneumonia. There is a "ground glass" appearance and water in the lungs, but it is distributed in a widespread way, not in pockets like an infection would cause.

In sepsis and serious trauma, absorption of endotoxin will cause "shock lung" or wet lungs. The lung fills up with water just from stress and trauma. The virus can have very little to do with the so-called pneumonia. The virus is known to infect several organs, including the intestine. If it starts in the intestine, they might not find anything in the nose, but the intestine can be thoroughly infected, leading to sepsis and wet lung.

## Sepsis and ACE Inhibitors

**Andrew Murray:** A Chinese study published in *The Lancet* on March 11th stated that 59% of 191 COVID-19 patients developed sepsis, and sepsis was present in 100% of those who died. It was the most commonly observed complication.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The heart, lungs, and intestine are the main places the virus infects. But sepsis alone can cause both heart and lung symptoms. Multiple organ failure is the standard endpoint of sepsis itself, and these ventilated patients typically get ventilated all the way to multiple organ failure. Treating sepsis is the first thing, but avoiding *causing* sepsis is even more important.

The receptor, the ACE2 enzyme (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2), was discovered 20 years ago. Within three years, it was identified as a heart-protecting enzyme. If you knock out ACE2, the heart becomes enlarged and fibrotic. ACE2 protects the heart; it is ACE1 which causes damage to the heart and lungs.

It was known to be an anti-inflammatory enzyme 17 years ago. The Chinese and several groups around the world were trying out anti-inflammatory treatments, including angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), as treatment for SARS and getting good results. The Chinese most recently found good results from a serotonin receptor blocker, and an antihistamine. They also mentioned two herbs, knotweed and sophora root, both of which are anti-inflammatory.

**Andrew Murray:** You brought up Losartan previously.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There are clinical trials being done in the United States, specifically in Michigan, using Losartan to treat COVID-19 patients.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's very good to hear. In March, *The Lancet* published one of the most horribly ignorant and dangerous articles I've seen. The authors warned the world *against* using exactly those things which are most protective: the angiotensin blockers.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That was being circulated in doctors' offices. A colleague of mine said nurses and doctors were briefed not to prescribe ACE inhibitors. When I told her what you said about Losartan, she spoke to the doctor, got the literature, and they put patients back on Losartan.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In March, two people confirmed to have the coronavirus asked me for advice. I referred them to the Chinese studies. Two of them managed to get Losartan; they both said they felt better immediately and were entirely well the next day.

## Financial Incentives and Vitamin D

**Andrew Murray:** I also wanted to mention work looking at Vitamin D as a viable antiviral. They discussed how African Americans are particularly susceptible, potentially due to lower Vitamin D levels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It revs up the immune system to resist viral and bacterial infections, but a major part of its effect is as an anti-inflammatory. Since inflammation is what causes sickness and death, Vitamin D is one of our most important anti-inflammatory weapons. Aspirin is also not only anti-inflammatory but has well-established broad-spectrum antiviral activity.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Our surgeon friend confirmed that simple remedies like aspirin are really helping people because it is so anti-inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw the Kaiser Family Foundation discussing the funding from the CARES Act. If a patient is admitted with a coronavirus diagnosis, the hospital gets about $16,000. If they are put on a ventilator, the amount is $48,000. It's worth the hospital more than $30,000 just to kill the patient.

**Andrew Murray:** Without being cynical, this might explain why you don't hear about heart disease or pulmonary problems right now—everyone is getting admitted under the COVID diagnosis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, suddenly very few people are dying of the usual things.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, if the virus can be present in the intestine and not the nose, nasal swabs might be giving false negatives.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I noticed the CDC's chart of influenza cases and deaths fell off like a cliff around April 1st, with a sudden lurch upward in corona diagnoses. It looked exactly as if you had just redefined influenza as corona.

## Caller: Lab Origins and Gain of Function

**Caller (Kirsten):** In the March show, Dr. Peat talked about a lab working on vaccines that had to close last year. I was wondering if he could repeat where that was?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That particular one was Fort Detrick, but there was one at the University of North Carolina working with them. That was a *Nature* article, I believe from November 2015.

**Caller (Kirsten):** Was it shut down for sanitation issues?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but that same lab had been previously closed for a moratorium on a particular kind of virus research. One group of virologists argued this research was intrinsically useless and dangerous. In 2014, the government put a three-year moratorium on that kind of research. Within a few weeks, Tony Fauci took $3.7 million to fund the Wuhan lab to continue the research that was considered questionable or dangerous. They continued in Wuhan until the accident, or whatever it was, last September.

**Caller (Kirsten):** This is Dr. Tony Fauci from the White House?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. He apparently ignored the moratorium. I think that would be criminal to continue banned research outside the U.S. where they could get away with it.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this "gain of function"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Generally, it is necessary to create a chimera—a combination of two totally different viruses—to get a really good gain of function. This process was developed for military uses. I think it was Nixon who ordered the end of bio-warfare virology, but it continued under the guise of vaccine research. The justification was that if an enemy created a super-virulent virus, we needed to anticipate that and make a vaccine.

The virology community was violently divided. Fort Detrick had over a thousand leaks or accidents in a period of just a few years. Finally, last year, they were shut down. But the dangerous research had been resumed in 2017. So Wuhan had been the source of it for three years, then it came back.

## Caller: Stress and Susceptibility

**Caller (James):** I have a friend, 39 years old, who supposedly died of this super virus. I think he just got ventilated before the doctors realized it wasn't helpful. He had a lot of emotional stress from work problems. Could that make someone relatively young more susceptible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The angiotensin system is responsive to stress and emotions.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's the very thing that would be ramped up in the presence of stress.

## Caller: Losartan Mechanism

**Caller (Corly):** Regarding Losartan, I was under the impression that medication affects the ACE1 inhibitors, but the virus attacks the receptor sites of ACE2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** ACE2 is the enzyme that destroys angiotensin. Angiotensin acts on Angiotensin Receptor Number 1 (AT1). That is the thing that activates constriction of blood vessels, inflammation, and fibrosis of the heart. All the bad stuff is activated at AT1 by angiotensin.

The "receptor" for the virus is ACE2. Its function in the body is to destroy the toxic angiotensin and convert it into a beneficial form called Angiotensin 1-7, which is anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory. The virus sticking to that protein limits its ability to detoxify.

Losartan is an Angiotensin Receptor Inhibitor Number 1. Losartan blocks the bad effects of angiotensin and, at the same time, allows the body to increase the production of the ACE2 enzyme—the protective destroyer of angiotensin.

## Caller: UV Light and Ozone

**Caller (Portland):** Can UV light or ozone be used to disinfect the air? Could you cycle air through a filter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think both of those would be risky. The risk would be increasing inflammation. The idea medically is always to kill the invader, but the successful treatments so far have been ignoring the virus. Standard medical thinking is that viral replication causes the problems, but actually, it's the inflammation that leads to the replication of the virus. If you stop the inflammation, you don't have to worry about the virus.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's not critical to think about sterilizing the air?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is fine to sterilize the air, but you can't sterilize the inside of the body. Some people are advocating treating the blood with ozone, but that could intensify the inflammation.

## Caller: Lactoferrin and Vaccines

**Caller (Connecticut):** What are your thoughts on lactoferrin as an antimicrobial? And is there anything you can do to protect against adjuvants in vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On the second part: anti-inflammatories are protective against everything. However, once you've injected aluminum into the muscle, you are going to have lifelong effects. Aluminum in the muscle has unpredictable effects; particles are often sent up the nerve fiber to the brain where they cause continuing amplification of inflammation. I wouldn't encourage anyone to think they can protect themselves from an aluminum-containing injection.

Regarding lactoferrin, it is a natural protein of the milk system and the intrinsic immune system. If you are in good health, with good Vitamin D and Vitamin A status, you will make these things. It is probably safe to supplement.

## Caller: Water Fasting

**Caller (Joan):** I've used water fasting for 30 years to tame inflammation. I haven't heard any mention of this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has been used for autoimmune diseases very successfully. The inflammatory reactions they are seeing in COVID overlap strongly with autoimmune diseases.

## Censorship and Control

**Andrew Murray:** The war against "fake news" is being taken up by social media platforms. Content contradicting the World Health Organization is being blocked. In a true democracy, you have people shouting on the street corner, but when that is silenced, it isn't a free society.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have traced back the funding origins of Google and social media and found that the CIA was the crucial seed money. Even though they are technically private organizations, they are guided by and responsible to the CIA and Pentagon.

**Andrew Murray:** It seems part of a move toward a one-world order and a cashless society. There is discussion about paper money transmitting the virus as a reason to outlaw it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That started a few years ago in India. There were thousands of deaths because people couldn't get electronic money.

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time. Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com. He has written many articles based on science, not just mainstream medical narratives. Thank you for joining us.
