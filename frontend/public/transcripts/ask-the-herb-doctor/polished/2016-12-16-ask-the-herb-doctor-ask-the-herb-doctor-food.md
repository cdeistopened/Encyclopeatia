## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to tonight's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine. We consult with clients all over the states on wide-ranging subjects. Once again, we are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us to share his wisdom. I just got his latest newsletter. He produces prodigious amounts of written work. Dr. Peat, are you on the line with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Great. For tonight's show, we're going to open up parts of previous shows based on inflammation and Dr. Peat's current work looking at autoimmunity, linking that to estrogen and inflammation, and how the concept of cell energy is something he is constantly advocating. Thyroid hormone is one of the pillars, along with progesterone, pregnenolone, and vitamin D. Dr. Peat, for those hearing you for the first time, would you outline your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I did my PhD study at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. Before that, I had been a graduate student and teacher in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and English literature, among other things. I see that one of your questions from last month was about the trophoblast theory of cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Right.

## The Trophoblast Theory and Cancer

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just when I was starting my biology study in 1968, I had known a famous old cancer genetics researcher, Leonell Strong. He was studying the curability of mammary cancer in the strains of mice that he developed using different types of liver extract. In thinking about that, I realized there might be an overlap with the work he was doing and the old John Beard trophoblast theory of cancer, which was behind the Laetrile treatment.

**Andrew Murray:** That was from apricot seeds, okay.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Laetrile activates a process that its proponents saw just as a poison for the cancer cells. But since it involved activation by the enzyme beta-glucuronidase—which happens to be an enzyme that activates estrogen—I saw a link with Leonell Strong's work. In his work, the cancer-prone animals inherited a tendency to have high estrogen from their mothers' prenatal gestational conditions. When he used a liver extract, the animals he treated not only didn't get cancer themselves, but their offspring for several generations didn't get cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Was that because of the vitamin B6 in the liver helping them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He believed it was one of the nucleotide fractions that has analogs in mainline cancer chemotherapy; he believed it was stabilizing the DNA. My impression was that there were anti-estrogenic substances in the liver, and some of them were also the nucleotides that Strong was talking about.

Even though I think the trophoblast theory is wrong in its details, it's extremely rich in its overlap with the actual facts of how cancer develops. The estrogen factor that Strong was working on, and the role of enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase, link these ideas. The Laetrile theory was based on overlap with the trophoblast theory, and the main treatment people used going by the Beard trophoblast theory involved pancreatic enzymes or extracts of the pancreas.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned the product Laetrile, which some people might recognize as the seed kernel extract from apricots. Wasn't the rationale that it would break down the sugar linkage and release cyanide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was the Krebs idea, that it was poisoning the cell. His theory was very nice, except there was a theory for Laetrile that he defined as the glucuronide. The molecule that he published had glucuronic acid on it, which would be specifically released by cancer cells—or by any inflamed cell—but would be poisonous only to cancer cells because they lack the ability to detoxify cyanide.

**Andrew Murray:** Isn't beta-glucuronidase an enzyme that breaks down the sugar linkages?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and glucuronic acid happens to be how toxic substances are detoxified for excretion by the liver through the kidneys. Estrogen glucuronide is one of the main excreted forms.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I have a great liver mushroom pate recipe for people who want to make that for the holidays. The mushrooms have anti-estrogen compounds in them too, if you boil them down really well before you cook the liver with it.

**Andrew Murray:** We've mentioned the button mushroom extract in the past, which has been used as an aromatase inhibitor. That is interesting in the concept of treating cancers.

## Carbohydrates, Dextrinization, and Cooking

**Andrew Murray:** I had a couple of questions based on sugars. One was: Does dextrinization and protein coagulation change complex carbs into simple sugars? Do you know much about this dextrinization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a process that has been used for about 200 years. The first form of it was basically what they used to make Karo syrup or corn syrup—boiling cornstarch with sulfuric acid. It makes a pale, almost clear syrup. But the longer you cook it, and the harsher the acidic or basic conditions are, the browner it gets. They know that the brown stuff in molasses is mutagenic and carcinogenic, just like any charred carbohydrate, starch, or sugar.

When you sort out the corn starch from the germ, you're still getting enzymes and amino groups spread throughout the starch. Those amino groups participate in the classical browning reaction that makes these mutagenic carcinogens. So, the dextrinization produces some dextrose and simple sugars, but the gumminess depends on how far you carry the breakdown reaction. On average, dextrins are considered to have groups of glucose molecules that are around 5 to 15 molecules long.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So cane juice is very thin because there is basically zero starch in that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the sugar is very thin. It contains sucrose itself, so you don't need to process that.

**Andrew Murray:** Just to recap, anything really to do with temperature and starches involving caramelization can be termed as carcinogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At least as far as the combination with amino groups, amino acids, and proteins. Those are the best-known mutagens. Acrylamide turns up every time you heat a natural carbohydrate that contains traces of amino acids or proteins. In the absence of amino acids, instead of acrylamide, you probably get small amounts of acrolein, which is another very toxic carcinogenic material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about protein like meat and eggs? When they brown, is that also carcinogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are traces of sugar in those, so you do get some of the same compounds.

**Andrew Murray:** Another question was: Do amylase or amylopsin help change complex carbs into sugars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Amylopsin is just a pancreatic amylase.

## Caloric Needs and Protein

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of general nutrition, what would you rate as acceptable calories for a female doing relatively sedentary work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I hope 2,000 is a ballpark. You can be very sedentary and still burn close to 3,000. Some people can be moderately active and get along on 1,700. Lots of people now are hypothyroid enough that they can move around with ordinary daily activity and still gain weight on 700 or 800 calories. You really have to look at your metabolic rate.

**Andrew Murray:** How about protein intake for a female?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The military did a big study on people of military age, both men and women, and found that to do just ordinary work, both needed at least 100 grams of good protein every day. You see lots of people getting by on 25 or 30 grams, but I've known people always with pretty serious symptoms getting only 20 grams or less per day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's hard if you don't want to eat meat three times a day. You can't eat more than two eggs a day because they contain some PUFA. So then you're left with dairy. I think dairy is the primary source of protein that's healthy for people.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you advocate gelatin a lot, but that's not going to make up to 100 grams of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

## Sugars and Digestion

**Andrew Murray:** What do you recommend for sugars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It really depends on your digestion and intestinal health. When I was in Mexico, I saw nutritionists trying to justify a bean and rice-based diet. It turns out that potatoes are infinitely better than beans as a source of protein, but that requires your intestine to be in fairly good health. The complex carbohydrates of either can support bacterial growth if you have a sluggish digestion.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If people were going to eat potatoes as a source of protein, they better have a pretty strong intestinal wall, otherwise all that starch will irritate them. I know you advocate potato juice used to make a kind of scramble. That's actually starch-free, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's for people who have digestive problems but still need a very high-quality protein.

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of grams of sugar for somebody in a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies in the late 1800s found that diabetics were putting out about 12 ounces of sugar in their urine every day in extreme terminal diabetes. They reasoned that patients would die less quickly if they replaced that amount of sugar. They gave them a regular diet plus 10 or 12 ounces of plain white sugar and found that instead of dying more slowly, they got well.

It depends on what stress your system is under. Huge amounts of sugar like that can be curative if you're under stress. But if your digestive system is very healthy, you can get along with starch instead of sugar. You still need a few hundred grams of carbohydrate either as starch or sugar every day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had a client who had extensive surgery and needed up to a pound of sugar a day in various forms—marshmallows, sugar in milk—to lower the stress so he could sleep. He went from not sleeping at all to sleeping all through the night just from increasing his sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen similar things in people with cancer or extreme old age insomnia. When they drank a syrup-like concentrate of sugar in milk or ate a bowl of ice cream during the night, they could get back to sleep.

## Dr. Peat's Typical Diet

**Andrew Murray:** What kind of foods do you typically gravitate towards?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Two or three quarts of milk, up to a gallon per day, usually 1%. Usually one big egg fried in butter. Orange juice, as much as is available—if it's good, at least a pint, preferably more. Typically about once a week, some oysters or liver. Almost every day, some kind of gelatinous soup, like kale soup or chicken soup with all the fat skimmed off.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We eat milk powder pancakes every morning. How often do you eat those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every day when we have the powder supply.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Milk is a very good source of high-quality sugar, lactose. One glass has 12 grams of sugar. One glass of orange juice has 25. You can add extra sugar to your milk to make up your quota.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The lactose in milk is famous for helping to absorb calcium. Some studies indicate that fructose or sucrose can serve the same purpose and spare the calcium in your diet. So you can be slightly deficient in calcium and make it up by having enough sugar to keep the stress down so you don't waste your calcium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Regarding lactose intolerance: if you're not drinking milk, your body will stop producing the enzyme to break it down. If you just take a tablespoon a day and increase it, within a month you'll have a full spectrum of enzymes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Especially if your thyroid is good, you can change your enzymes more quickly—maybe in two weeks.

## Red Light Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** A listener asked if red LEDs would be sufficient for red light therapy, as opposed to the 250-watt heat lamps.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably at least some of the wavelengths are enough to reactivate the respiratory enzyme. That's one of the crucial effects of sunlight, incandescent light, and some LEDs. The respiratory enzyme contains a copper atom. In the darkness, it tends to be displaced from the enzyme, causing failure of the respiratory system. The red light has just the right amount of energy to move the copper back into its proper oxidizing position.

## Caller: Veganism

**Caller:** I want to know what you think about being a vegan. Is there any way you can eat that way and be healthy and get enough protein and vitamin B?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The closest you can come to it would be eating potatoes and mushrooms. Mushrooms are very similar to meat protein, and your intestine can make vitamin B12, which is sometimes deficient in a vegan diet. With the trace minerals of mushrooms and the high-quality proteins and vitamins of potatoes, you can do pretty well. But most vegans don't do very well.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think they're really deficient in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium. They break bones too easily once they get to be 60 or 70.

**Caller:** I heard there were no natural indigenous cultures that were vegan. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people have studied the Fulani people of Africa and found that they were pretty close to vegan, but very sick. Lots of heart disease.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Probably because of the calcium deficiency. Calcium is very important for your heart. You need about 2,000 mg a day, which is basically two quarts of milk.

## Caller: Vegan with Dairy Allergy

**Caller (Spiroc):** I was wondering about the correlation of a high dairy allergy. I'm also a vegan, so what will I do for calcium and protein besides the potato every day?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about eggshells?

**Caller (Spiroc):** That's from an animal. You can't get it from vegetables?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Leafy greens, if you cook them thoroughly and save the water, are a good source of calcium and magnesium.

**Andrew Murray:** How much do you think you would have to eat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About a pound, I think.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You'd have to boil a pound down a day and drink all that water. Also, putting baking soda in it helps neutralize oxalic acid, which blocks calcium absorption.

**Caller (Spiroc):** What about protein intake?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How many pounds of potatoes would you have to eat a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Five pounds.

**Caller (Spiroc):** Are a lot of nuts bad for you?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Nuts have a lot of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that are very estrogenic.

**Caller (Spiroc):** So better to have more seeds?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Seeds and nuts are both very high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. They're not a great source of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only nuts I know of that are fairly safe for the fats would be macadamias. They are pretty saturated fat.

## Caller: Fermented Vegetables

**Caller (Bob):** We're getting involved with fermented vegetables—cabbage and all kinds. It really straightens up the flora in your gut. What do you think about fermented vegetables?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of them taste very nice, like sauerkraut, but I don't think there is much nutritional value in them, and there's a risk of getting bad fungus contamination. In Asia, where fermented vegetables are very popular, they've seen a lot of stomach and throat cancer that they think comes from the fungal contamination.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about the lactic acid content?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lactic acid puts a burden on your liver to turn it back into glucose. It takes more energy than you get out of the glucose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you think it's more nutritious to boil the vegetables rather than ferment them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about the probiotics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The small intestine is best when it's cleanest. Very vigorous people with good digestion and high thyroid function have almost a sterile small intestine from their mouth to their appendix. You get a chance to absorb all the nutrients without competing with bacteria. In a healthy person, the bacteria grow just in the colon. You don't want to support bacterial growth higher up in your intestine.

## Caller: Vitamin D and Methylation

**Caller (Colorado):** How would I find out if my methylation is interfering with my vitamin D absorption? I tried a therapeutic dose of 12,000 IU for a couple of months. I brought the level up to 73, but my symptoms persisted.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would guess that any symptoms you have related to vitamin D might be from not having enough calcium and magnesium, or maybe having too much phosphate in your diet. It's important to have more calcium than phosphate on a molar basis. Americans often have five or six times too much phosphate relative to calcium.

**Caller (Colorado):** I drink about two or three quarts of milk a day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What are the symptoms you associate with the vitamin D?

**Caller (Colorado):** I get a headache in the middle of the night.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you eat any antiseptic fibrous food like raw carrots?

**Caller (Colorado):** Yes, every day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about your thyroid function?

**Caller (Colorado):** I can only keep my temperature up to about 98. I can't get higher than that.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you're below 98, your immune system is at like half power.

**Caller (Colorado):** I'm up to 1.75 grains of thyroid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Some people need 2 micrograms, some need 200. If you can't get your temperature up above 98, then you don't have enough thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes a mysterious headache can be traced to a single supplement or a single food causing an allergic irritation.

**Caller (Colorado):** I think I found that the microbial enzymes in cheeses might be the issue.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The two cheeses we know are made with animal rennet are Parmigiano Reggiano and Pecorino Romano. People with sensitivity to cheese often don't find problems with those two.

## Caller: Calcium and Heartburn

**Caller (Ontario):** When raising calcium, I get heartburn. What would be the cause? And secondly, what to do for oily skin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of people get stomach irritation from calcium supplements and magnesium supplements—anything manufactured or in an excessively pure form. Eggshell is almost pure calcium carbonate. Your stomach and intestine have trouble with pure chemistry. Milk is extremely complex and soothing to the digestive membranes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How much eggshell are you taking?

**Caller (Ontario):** About half a teaspoon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would skip it for a week and see what happens. If you're getting two quarts of milk plus cottage cheese, you're probably good.

**Caller (Ontario):** I'm just trying to really push that calcium-phosphate ratio. I'm not eating meat right now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding oily skin: in general, oily skin is very good. It ages very slowly. If you have oily skin when you're 25 or 30, you'll probably have young-looking skin when you're 60 because it's metabolically so active.

**Andrew Murray:** So it signifies good thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually, yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Are you taking vitamin D?

**Caller (Ontario):** Yes, and vitamins A, E, and K.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes vitamin A can be irritating to the intestine. I had to stop using it orally several years ago and use it only on my skin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That might be too much vitamin A for your thyroid function.
