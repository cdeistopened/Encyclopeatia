# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Endocrinology Part II

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the show, we run from 7:00 to 8:00 PM the third Friday of every month. From 7:30 to 8:00 PM, we invite callers to join with any questions related or unrelated to the subject.

This evening's show will be a continuation of endocrinology. Last month, Dr. Raymond Peat was discussing Parkinsonisms, symptoms, and causality. A lot of what we read is subject to bad science, no science at all, or just downright lies. I wanted to give an overview of endocrinology—the organs that secrete the hormones and the target organs that are either stimulated or inhibited by them—to bring out Dr. Peat's understanding of hormone physiology. That is his specialty, for which he has been working and studying for the last 45 years.

In a search for truth, there seems to be an endless variety of rabbit holes. Science's greatest ally is verifiable observation; hard facts speak volumes. How we perceive the world influences our very being in the world. Two ends of the spectrum are learned helplessness and its counterpart, environmental enrichment, both of which have been discussed on previous shows.

How we understand physiology shapes our approach to aberrations within it. The outcome is modulated by a faithful scientific approach through verifiable observation on the one hand, and the holistic realization that the web of life is fluid. Nowhere else does this multiverse exist within our very being more than in the nervous system, and particularly the endocrine system.

Dr. Peat, I had this conversation with you this afternoon. What is a hormone? I know you have a very different outlook on it.

## Defining Hormones vs. Genetic Determinism

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a question I brought up with my endocrinology students at the Naturopathic College in the 1970s. Against the background of classical endocrinology, it has a different meaning than when you look at it against the contemporary theory taught to medical students.

If you look at the standard definition—that a hormone is something secreted by cells somewhere in the body into the body fluids, moves in those fluids, and acts on cells somewhere else—then can't you say that lactic acid and carbon dioxide are just as much hormones as anything else? They are created by various cells, move in the body fluids, and definitely act on cells in other parts of the body.

However, what has developed over the last 50 years incorporates the idea of genes as the controlling agent of any cell. If a substance is going to act on a cell in a different part of the body, the theory assumes it must be activating its genes. The idea of a receptor as something that picks up a substance to activate the genes has come to the center of textbook medical endocrinology.

The way I see the subject is really an extension of the very beginnings. Around the middle of the 19th century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard became famous when he claimed that squashing testicles in a watery solution and injecting the solution would rejuvenate a man's virility. He described the changes he saw in himself. But in the 20th century, almost every textbook of endocrinology starts out by ridiculing that as a complete mistake—a placebo—because they say testosterone isn't water-soluble.

But he wasn't saying that he was injecting testosterone. He was making a squash solution of testicles. The testicle is full of hormones, many of which are fairly insoluble in water, but it's also full of lipids which solubilize and emulsify them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Hasn't that been a part of ancient medicine, the ingestion of ovaries and testicles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, you can eat them and get the same hormones. But if you squash them and make a watery extract, you are getting an emulsified whole range of not just testosterone, but many other steroids closely related to it. It is a very ideological thing that these textbooks and professors have to put down Brown-Séquard before they can get on with their business. He was saying that the gland itself is producing substances that are vitally important and that can simply bypass many medical problems and reverse degenerative processes.

For example, in Parkinson's disease, simply giving testosterone has a very powerful therapeutic effect, but it is outside of the mainline thinking regarding dopamine deficiency.

The whole field changed around the time of August Weismann. He is famous for supposedly disproving Lamarckism by cutting off the tails of mice and observing that the offspring still had tails. He was pretty much an idiot, but his idea was that an animal differentiating tissues from a fertilized ovum involved the progressive loss of genetic information. He believed the brain, skin, and eyes each had their own genetic composition. For the whole organism to function as a unit, these genetically discrete parts had to have some way to communicate.

That ideology was designed for religious and political purposes to explain that an organism is basically mortal—that you can't cure incurable diseases because they are predetermined. That genetic idea took over and displaced the potential-filled biology of people like Brown-Séquard.

**Andrew Murray:** The way you look at it is that the structural organization of neurons leads to a better genetic pattern or blueprint. It is like an environmental enrichment scenario.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Each cell is adapting and adjusting itself to the other parts. When you look at the fact that a skin cell contains all the genes needed to make a brain cell, the idea of cloning an organism from a single cell means that every cell is full of potential.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it is just the environment that it is exposed to that determines its function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The way the organism comes into being is by each cell confronting its environment. When it divides, the new cell becomes part of its environment. The whole development of the organism is a process of perceiving its environment and adapting to what it perceives.

Hormones, as we currently talk about them, are just one of thousands of components produced by cells acting on other cells. One of the meanings of this is that we are all in slightly imperfect environments. Our history is continuously a matter of overcoming environmental limitations.

**Andrew Murray:** That brings me to the point of *in utero* nutrition and how pivotal that is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ratio of the person's brain to body, their longevity, life expectancy, and the amount of energy they have at any stage of life is pretty much set by the intrauterine condition.

## Caller: Thyroid, Weight Gain, and Heat Intolerance

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line. Where are you from?

**Caller (Australia):** I'm from Australia. I have a question for Dr. Peat. I am hypothyroid and have Hashimoto's. My pulse in the morning is around 56 and at night it's around 75. I have low temperatures in the morning as well. I live in the subtropics, so it is very hot.

My main question is: I haven't had PUFA [polyunsaturated fatty acids] for about five years. I've been trying to increase sugar, having milk and orange juice, and reducing cruciferous vegetables. Despite this, I've ended up being 30 kilos (66 lbs) overweight. I'm desperate to find a way to lose that weight without a starvation routine. I take primarily only T3.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding the weight gain and the sluggish thyroid—she is using T3, not a T4 supplement.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The important thing is to keep your body temperature up. It should be in the range of 98°F to 99.5°F (approx. 37°C) during the daytime. A little higher is fine because it promotes the healthy oxidation of fat.

Keeping your liver well-nourished with protein and B vitamins is essential. The liver is able to throw off the polyunsaturated fats, recognizing them as toxic material. Your liver can get rid of quite a bit of stored fat, largely during the night. Keeping your body temperature up during the night with a good amount of protein, calcium, and trace nutrients is important.

If necessary, supplement T3, progesterone, and either pregnenolone or DHEA. DHEA is anabolic for the muscles, but it activates heat production. It causes you to "waste" heat, but it isn't really wasted because it keeps your nerve function up and inflammation down.

**Caller (Australia):** I do a lot of those things. In Brisbane, it is over 30°C every day and I am sweating all the time. How do you make your body increase its temperature?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How many grams of protein are you getting a day?

**Caller (Australia):** I have about 2 liters of milk and a liter of orange juice. Occasionally some lamb or steak.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is not always 100 grams of protein. If you are at all active, you need 100 grams of protein to keep your metabolic rate up. The calcium in 2 liters of milk is likely enough; calcium promotes heat production. Sodium works with calcium to produce heat. Progesterone helps to set your temperature so it stays up during the day and doesn't drop extremely during the night.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I want to discuss the calories. Two liters of milk is anywhere from 800 to 1200 calories, plus 400+ calories in the juice. If your morning pulse is in the 50s and never gets above 75, your metabolic rate probably isn't burning that amount of calories. For a 50-year-old woman, this might be the issue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is where the DHEA comes in. Adjusting your T3 and progesterone is important. Estrogen tends to lower your temperature, so you want to keep the ratio of progesterone to estrogen pretty high—100 to 1 is good.

**Andrew Murray:** You said you have been PUFA-free for five years. Have you gained these 30 kilos over those five years?

**Caller (Australia):** Pretty much.

**Andrew Murray:** What are your morning temperatures?

**Caller (Australia):** Around 35.8°C or 36°C (96.4°F - 96.8°F). It does rise, and I feel heat after I eat certain things. I take a squeeze of Progest-E every night.

**Andrew Murray:** And how much T3?

**Caller (Australia):** Between 20 and 40 micrograms a day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One thing that can cause you to produce nitric oxide—which lowers your temperature and works with estrogen to reverse the effects of thyroid—is intestinal inflammation produced by bacteria eating food that isn't fully digested. Avoiding hard-to-digest foods can reduce nitric oxide and estrogen. Sometimes just having a raw carrot every day or a good portion of cooked mushrooms can reduce the endotoxin and nitric oxide production enough to switch your progesterone/estrogen ratio and raise your temperature.

**Andrew Murray:** Did you have a history of estrogen dominance?

**Caller (Australia):** Yes, absolutely. I went through menopause at 43. Prior to that, my estrogen level was about a thousand times what it was supposed to be.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you ever noticed an antibiotic having a good effect?

**Caller (Australia):** Yes, but I'm afraid to take antibiotics due to yeast overgrowth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For yeast overgrowth, mushrooms and carrots are sometimes enough. But flowers of sulfur—just a pinch of it—will clear up a yeast infection pretty quickly, usually in two or three days.

In a fertility clinic about 30 years ago, they gave antibiotics to improve fertility. A lot of the women noticed drastic improvements in general health, stopping migraines and other estrogen-related symptoms. It turned out the antibiotics were lowering stress hormones and estrogen while raising progesterone. It eliminates the endotoxin to the extent that it stops producing nitric oxide and lets your cells begin oxidizing intensely.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Regarding weight loss, as you get older, your metabolism slows. I found it helpful for some clients to use eggshell powder for calcium so they don't have to drink the same quantity of milk. You can live for several months on milk and orange juice, but if you aren't menstruating and have a slow metabolism, you might not lose weight fast on that volume of liquid.

**Andrew Murray:** The pulse in the mid-50s is definitely suboptimal. Dr. Peat usually recommends a pulse between 75 and 85 as a good indicator of metabolic rate. People who are overweight have an uphill struggle using thyroid to generate metabolic rate because the weight itself creates resistance to the hormone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping your serum Vitamin D around the middle of the range (50 to 60 ng/mL) is helpful for keeping your temperature and metabolic rate up. Also, a little bit of coconut oil can increase heat production.

**Caller (Australia):** I use coconut oil. It sounds like it points to endotoxins in the gut.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The raw carrot slows digestion but helps lose weight because it binds some of the fat and carries it out of the body. It also carries out estrogen excreted in the bile.

**Andrew Murray:** Liver support would be a good direction. Liver stimulants or bitters, or milk thistle, would support hepatic function to remove waste.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Two drugs that help the liver maintain high activity are Cascara sagrada, which is anti-inflammatory and a liver tonic, and aspirin. Also, doing a little muscle-building exercise, such as dumbbell lifting for just two or three minutes at a time, helps to shift the hormone ratio.

## Caller: Poison Oak and Warts

**Caller (Garberville):** I have a question about poison oak. I got my first case ever. What botanical aid can I get?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We produce a product called Allergy Ease, sold at Chautauqua. It contains antihistamine herbs. If you start that as soon as you start itching, it helps. Otherwise, a clean diphenhydramine product (Benadryl) if the herbs aren't effective enough. Keeping your good sugars up—fruit sugars and honey—will really help keep histamine from being released.

**Caller (Garberville):** I have one other question. I have a plantar wart on the bottom of my foot. Besides salicylic acid, what do you recommend?

**Andrew Murray:** There is a plant excellent for warts called *Chelidonium majus*, the Greater Celandine. It is in the poppy family and has yellow flowers. If you break the stem, it exudes a bright orange-yellow sap. If you dab that on the plantar wart for about a week, the wart will turn black and the skin will peel off.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It isn't native here, though we have it in our garden. Another option is dandelion sap. It's not as effective as Greater Celandine, but if you pick the stem or flower of a dandelion, a white exudate comes out. You can dab that on the wart. Dr. Peat, what do you recommend for warts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That sounds as good as anything I know. I think salicylic acid is best.

## The Pituitary and Stress Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the endocrine system, I wanted to look at the hypothalamus. TRH (Thyrotropin-releasing hormone) stimulates TSH (Thyroid-stimulating hormone) release. It also stimulates prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Dr. Peat, since prolactin is released as well as TSH, how come it doesn't generate milk production in non-lactating females?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It very often does. For many years, I've noticed that when a woman complains of menorrhagia (prolonged excessive menstruation), they are often secreting milk even if they've never been pregnant. The hormone changes leading to excessive menstruation also cause prolactin excess, and probably growth hormone excess too.

It is not uncommon for a middle-aged woman to have chronic milk formation associated with the overactivity of the thyroid system because their thyroid gland itself isn't able to produce the active hormones to turn off the pituitary.

Almost everything the pituitary does has a constructive, adaptive effect to overcome stress. However, in itself, the substances produced in the pituitary are all harmful if they are continued. You want to have such a responsive, high metabolic system that the tissue can respond fully to a little bit of pituitary hormone and turn it off quickly.

Animals that have their pituitaries removed and are given a supplement of cortisol and thyroid will often live two or three times longer than animals with normal pituitary function. This shows that the pituitary, to the extent that it is overactive, is shortening your life and shrinking your potential.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this is why you recommend TSH and ACTH being as low as possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. All of the pituitary hormones should be kept minimal.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Interesting, because if your body is producing enough thyroid, cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, then your pituitary hormones will be minimal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And if you get sunburned or have inflammation, your skin can produce pituitary hormones as well as stress hormones. Any simple tissue, if stressed, will produce pituitary hormones.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are going to carry this on next month with Endocrinology Part III. We will get into the rest of these hormones—corticotropin-releasing hormone, dopamine, growth hormone, oxytocin—and how they exert their effects.
