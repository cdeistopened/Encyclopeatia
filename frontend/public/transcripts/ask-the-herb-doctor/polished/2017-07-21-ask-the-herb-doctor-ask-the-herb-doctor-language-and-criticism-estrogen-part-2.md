# Ask Your Herb Doctor: The Estrogen Industry & Progesterone

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. We have been doing this for 13 years now, and as always, we have interesting information that is not frequently talked about. A lot of the science behind it has been buried, and there is definitely a conspiracy that we are in the process of uncovering.

Callers are invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject: Dr. Carla Rothenberg's thesis on the estrogen industry. We are discussing how the benefits of progesterone were suppressed, while cancer-causing progestogens and estrogens were hidden in plain sight. There is certainly collusion between the pharmaceutical companies, government lobbyists, and big pharma, who make a lot of money from estrogen sales and hormone replacement therapies.

There is lots of evidence and research showing that progesterone is extremely safe and actually anti-cancer. However, estrogen and some of the estriols are now on the Prop 65 list. This month, I wanted to include the Prop 65 information. Many people in California have seen the increasing notifications on dietary supplements and food products warning about Prop 65 components.

Dr. Raymond Peat will be joining us, and we're very pleased to have his expert knowledge. He is a professor of progesterone, estrogen, and other hormones, having done his dissertation on reproductive biology. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. I wanted you to tell people about your professional and academic background because there are some people who may have tuned in for the first time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I decided to study biology full-time, I was a teacher of English literature, painting, and other subjects. By the time I was approaching 30, I decided to get serious and study biology. I had been interested in it for a long time but postponed studying it because I saw there were ulterior motives in the field. I didn't want to start fighting the system until I had figured out how graduate schools worked.

I intended to study brain biology at first. In 1968, I enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Oregon. Within a few weeks, I saw that my major brain biology professor was very doctrinaire and used phrases such as, "We threw out the bad evidence."

**Andrew Murray:** Cherry-picking, huh?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It seemed like an ideological indoctrination program. So, I looked around the different departments and found that the reproductive people were actually doing observational, analytical science. I shifted from the brain concentration to the reproductive system.

Very quickly, I saw things that were counter to the textbook doctrines—for example, the idea of estrogen being a fertility drug. My professor had shown years before that estrogen was an abortifacient. His professor before him had been one of the earliest people showing that estrogen created abortions and miscarriages; that was discovered in the 1930s.

As I started studying the metabolism of the uterus, I saw that estrogen impaired the metabolic efficiency of the uterus, making it impossible for the embryo to survive if the tissue was dominated by estrogen rather than progesterone. It was a matter of oxygen delivery to the tissue. By finding the right professor to oversee my dissertation, I got through the program while contradicting all of the medical textbook opinions.

## The Suppression of Progesterone Research

**Andrew Murray:** I'd be happy to pass people a PDF version of the thesis Dr. Rothenberg wrote refuting the estrogen industry's claims. She exposed how the data was skewed—a cherry-picking situation where the "bad" evidence wasn't promoted.

You have always promoted progesterone as a progestational compound. Conversely, you've described estrogen as carcinogenic, inflammatory, and promoting weak cell states and decreased cell energy. In Dr. Rothenberg's papers, she outlined many instances where science was not reproducible.

Dr. Peat, having done your graduate studies on these hormones, would you say a little bit about progesterone's anti-aging effects regarding cell stabilization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In studying the effects of estrogen and aging on the uterus, I saw that the changes that occurred in old animals could be produced immediately just by overdosing them on estrogen. My professor had previously found that a vitamin E deficiency would create the same conditions. Others had found that an excess of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) created very similar conditions.

Around 1935 to 1940, vitamin E was known as the "fertility vitamin." Some Italian researchers in the 40s called vitamin E the "progesterone protective vitamin." They saw that both progesterone and vitamin E were preserving fertility, while estrogen or polyunsaturated fats were seen to create very quick miscarriage. My professor showed that at any stage of pregnancy, if you adjusted the dose of estrogen, you could create a miscarriage or death of the fetus.

**Andrew Murray:** This is interesting for women who are pregnant or have had miscarriages. We've seen the evidence that for women in danger of miscarrying, progesterone is a savior until the placenta can supply the natural progesterone, which is a thousand-fold higher than background levels.

What you mentioned about estrogen causing abortion should make women think about estrogen replacement therapy. Hopefully, the hormone replacement therapy bandwagon has been getting a beating because of the cancer and bone-weakening effects of estrogen. What do you say about progesterone supplementation during early pregnancy if a woman has high estrogen, low progesterone, and spotting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s and 40s, both thyroid hormone and progesterone were recognized as fertility protective chemicals. Progesterone was widely prescribed; if a woman started to bleed during the early months of pregnancy, just a few doses of progesterone would prevent that and save the pregnancy.

Thyroid was considered the main fertility chemical for a long time. But in the 1940s, after the estrogen industry created the consortium and conspiracy that Carla Rothenberg wrote about, similar things happened to the thyroid industry. The same companies that made estrogen were selling progesterone. Since progesterone countered the effects of estrogen, they suppressed their own promotion of progesterone to sell something compatible with estrogen.

I think it was 1946 or 1947 that I saw a publication declare that progesterone, the natural substance, is destroyed by stomach acid. This mention in a medical journal had no supporting reference or explanation. It turns out that to make progesterone, you purify the substance by boiling it in concentrated acid. Progesterone is intensely resistant to breakdown by stomach acid, so it works fine taken orally. But they created the myth that you can't take it orally so they could sell a new chemical called a "progestin."

**Andrew Murray:** Sounds like progesterone, but it wasn't.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. In fact, it became a component used with estrogen in birth control pills because it prevents gestation. They are anti-progestational, but they are categorized with the approval of the FDA in the same category as progesterone. That has tainted the understanding of progesterone. A similar thing happened with thyroid; synthetic products displaced natural thyroid, and the principle that thyroid creates fertility by lowering estrogen and increasing progesterone was suppressed for 70 years.

**Andrew Murray:** It is unbelievable. History is so important because errors compound over generations until the truth is unrecognizable.

I tell women that estrogen is really only useful for implantation because of the inflammation it causes. How would you describe estrogen in one sentence?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's a good description. It stimulates cell division during a period of about 12 hours once a month. It surges, dominates, and is concentrated in the pituitary, breasts, and uterus. It prepares those for pregnancy by creating a wave of cell division. But the function of progesterone is to come in at 100 times the concentration to knock out the estrogen binding chemical and stop the division so cells can start maturing.

**Andrew Murray:** It is totally progesterone that sustains a pregnancy and gives pregnant women that glowing skin and hair. Let's take our first caller.

## Caller: Progesterone Dosage and Heart Health

**Caller (London, Ontario):** Thank you, Dr. Peat; your wisdom literally saved my life. I read your newsletter "Heart Hormones." You mention the simplicity of supplementing thyroid, progesterone, and sugar, avoiding excess phosphate, and avoiding polyunsaturated fats. This helped me with my heart issue.

I need clarification on progesterone dosage for a male. Is it a good idea to put it around the heart area?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've used progesterone myself on and off for about 45 years. I've found that at times, only 10 milligrams per day was enough to stop my whiskers from growing temporarily—acting as an anti-testosterone. Other times, I can take 5 or 10 milligrams and it seems to increase my testosterone. Usually, it is people over 55 who have the pro-androgen effect when they take 10 or 20 milligrams.

However, if a person has heart failure, migraine, or epilepsy, I've used as much as 100 or 150 milligrams in one dose. For a migraine, it stopped it within a minute. You get a very sudden effect strengthening the heart with a strong dose.

It depends on your own hormone balance. You can take 5 milligrams, wait 15 minutes, see if you feel the desired effect, and repeat it. For example, when I'm under stress, I sometimes have bulgy veins on my hands. A big glass of sweet orange juice or a dollop of progesterone will make the veins tone up.

**Caller:** I assume you're taking them orally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Caller:** I have high calcium and high triglycerides. Is that a concern?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are produced under stress. Keeping the intestine uninflamed is key. Avoid raw or undercooked vegetables and grains. Increasing fiber content—raw carrot, cooked bamboo shoots, or cooked mushrooms—can lower stress hormones by cleaning out your intestine and preventing the reabsorption of estrogen and cortisol.

**Caller:** I read about Ouabain (strophanthus). Is that good to use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is similar to digitalis. In the right dose, it can be protective. However, progesterone and DHEA are the body's natural hormone equivalents and they don't have the risk you run if you're taking unmonitored Ouabain or digitalis.

**Caller:** You mentioned a lack of salt. I have slight swelling in my feet. I can eat salt to taste, but if I go any higher, my blood pressure goes up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salt is just one of the things that lowers aldosterone, the system that controls blood pressure. Progesterone is the body's natural antagonist to aldosterone. Progesterone and thyroid make you retain sodium so you don't have to eat a lot of it. Vitamin D and calcium are the other powerful factors for keeping aldosterone down.

If something is driving your aldosterone abnormally high—such as a progesterone deficiency—then the combination of high aldosterone and high salt intake will increase your blood pressure. But when your thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium intake are good, that will hold down your aldosterone.

**Caller:** I have high calcium according to my tests.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A high calcium level in the serum is a pretty good indication in most people that you aren't eating enough calcium or getting enough vitamin D. A vitamin D deficiency will often cause your parathyroid hormone to rise, taking calcium out of your bones and increasing serum calcium. Taking a good supplement to get your serum vitamin D level up to 50 ng/mL and taking at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day will generally lower your serum calcium to normal by lowering the parathyroid hormone.

**Caller:** Okay, I was eating eggshells and cheese, but I need to add more vitamin D. Thank you.

## Vegetable Oils and Cancer History

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to discuss the studies used to put progesterone on the California Prop 65 list. The research hasn't been done properly.

Dr. Peat, you've spoken about the dangers of liquid oils. Spontaneous cancers have been shown to increase in proportion to the quantity of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), especially linoleic acid, in the diet. By the end of the 60s, the carcinogenicity of vegetable oils was known. One WHO publication observed that progesterone carcinogenicity studies using vegetable oil as a carrier couldn't be recognized as valid because of the inflammation caused by the oil itself.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was around 1970 when it was finally becoming too public that linoleic acid was carcinogenic to keep promoting it as "heart protective," because it caused heart disease as well as cancer. That was when the fish oil industry grew up as an alternative "essential fatty acid."

1970 was a turning point for the essential fat mythology and the estrogen/progesterone industries. Carla Rothenberg points out the main phases of the conspiracy:
1.  **1940s:** Professors at Harvard promoted DES use during pregnancy, creating an epidemic of cervical cancer in daughters and granddaughters.
2.  **Birth Control:** The industry created a new definition where progesterone was identified with the anti-progesterone used in contraception.
3.  **1960s:** The estrogen industries gave $1.3 million to Robert Wilson to write *Feminine Forever*, a book of lying claims that estrogen keeps you young.

Following the support for Robert Wilson's book, there was a huge increase in sales of estrogens like Premarin. Prescriptions quadrupled between 1970 and 1975. Consequently, the incidence of metastatic breast cancer in very young women (ages 25-39) began to increase steadily. By 2009, that age group experienced a threefold increase.

In the 1930s and 40s, animal experiments showed that estrogen is carcinogenic to the uterus, breast, and next most sensitively, the lung. If you look at the incidence of lung cancer, it was dropping in men by the 1970s, but as women started using more estrogen, female lung cancer took off. The curve is very similar for lung cancer and young women's metastatic breast cancer.

## Caller: Environmental Estrogens

**Caller (Steven):** I think it's good you are telling people the history of birth control pills. I hope you will go into the crypto-estrogenic effects of things like fire retardants.

**Andrew Murray:** We have definitely done programs on Bisphenol A (BPA) and environmental estrogen mimics that have hormone-disrupting effects.

**Caller:** Thank you for presenting this information.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** The truth is out there if you are willing to look at the research yourself. Dr. Peat is an altruistic researcher who realized the problems within academic institutions regarding chemical companies.

I want to briefly touch on Prop 65 again. There are 986 chemicals on the list as of January 2017. Strangely, it often only applies if the product is put in your mouth. You will see increasing litigation regarding this.

Some surprising items on the Prop 65 list include:
*   **Aspirin:** Despite being a known anti-cancer substance. It is inexpensive and not patentable.
*   **Ethanol:** In alcoholic beverages.
*   **Wood dust.**
*   **Marijuana smoke:** This is likely why the industry is promoting vaping and oil production—another way to own rights.
*   **Arsenic and Methylmercury:** For seafood lovers.

We are run by legislators and litigators. Dr. Raymond Peat's work is freely available on his website, [raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). We will be back in September. Thanks for listening.
