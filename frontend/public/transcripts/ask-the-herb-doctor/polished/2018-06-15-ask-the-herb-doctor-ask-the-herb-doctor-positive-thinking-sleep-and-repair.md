## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. Every third Friday of the month, from 7:30 until 8:00 PM, we hold a call-in show where people ask questions related to the topic of the month.

As has been the custom since about 2007, we are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat. He has been a mentor and an excellent guide regarding things I once thought were true when I was at university studying herbal medicine. Often, those studies just repeated the doctrines and dogmas of professors who were taught by mainstream science, with all its apparent and repeated mistakes. We're very pleased to have Dr. Peat on the phone with us. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for giving your time. For those tuning in for the first time, could you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My early education was in literature, painting, and general humanities, including philosophy. After about 10 years, in 1968, I went to graduate school in biology intending to study nerve biology. Finding that to be the most dogmatic of the biological studies, I found the most empirical people in the department were working on reproductive physiology. So, I did my PhD in reproductive endocrinology and physiology. I got my PhD in 1972, and I've been studying, writing, and consulting since then.

## Progesterone, Sugar, and Guidelines

**Andrew Murray:** I want to quickly wrap up last month's discussion on the effects of progesterone. We discussed how the studies claiming progesterone was not effective—specifically the "Protect" and "Synapse" studies—actually had flawed designs.

Recently, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released guidelines regarding premenstrual syndrome that were pretty stunning given the usual debate about sugar. They said that keeping blood sugar levels up with smaller, frequent meals might be helpful. I know you've been a big proponent of keeping blood sugar up with liquid milk, orange juice, or carbohydrate-containing food every two hours. They also mentioned that calcium and magnesium—found in yogurt and leafy vegetables—might alleviate mood swings and bloating. They are actually giving a thumbs up to sugar, magnesium, and calcium.

## The Mind as a Garden

**Andrew Murray:** Before we move onto the subject of sleep and repair, I wanted to explore the remodeling of reality through exercising the conscious mind—specifically through positive affirmations—and how this benefits the physical body.

Biblically, prophets spoke in agrarian concepts like sowing and reaping. The mind can be viewed as a garden. Negative thoughts like doubt and fear are weeds which spring up automatically, sometimes out-competing the garden of prosperity. Universal quantum and spiritual laws govern our lives. The soil is your mind, the seed is the thought, the water is your action, and the sun is your feelings. Whatever you plant in your mind and water will grow.

Quantum physics now explains the observer effect, demonstrated by the double-slit experiment, which shows that the act of observing interacts with the observed, affecting the outcome. It can be inferred that the mind and thoughts affect conscious reality and physical health. Dr. Peat, do you have any thoughts on the mind as a garden?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Between working in literature and going back to school to study biology, I ran an experimental college called Blake College. My theory was that there are deliberate attempts to plant bad seeds in our garden. My approach to education was that if you create the right environment, people can uproot those planted bad seeds and create a fresh, new way of looking at the world.

We found that people who thought they were inferior students became fully functioning in just four, five, or six months in that environment. They achieved more in that short time than the average American college graduate achieves in four years.

**Andrew Murray:** This was through a liberal philosophy of understanding and learning rather than rote memory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because lots of bad intentions are being implanted along with the educational indoctrination that most people are getting.

**Andrew Murray:** You experienced that indoctrination in your own studies, especially regarding genetic determinism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Malthusianism and genetic determinism were very consciously political ideas which were accepted into science because the funding came from people with that political orientation.

## Faith Healing and Diagnosis

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about faith healing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is exactly analogous to what we were doing at Blake College—healing people from the cultural disease that had been given to them. There is a book by Larry Dossey called *Healing Words*, and an older book published in Russian in 1930 called *Words as Physiological and Therapeutic Factors*. In both cases, they treat words or thoughts as healing physiological factors. It puts the idea of faith healing into scientific terms.

**Andrew Murray:** I often find the word "diagnosis" is almost the kiss of death for some people. When people come to me without a diagnosis, describing symptoms, they often make quick progress through changes. But those with a diagnosis often face a roadblock.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had the experience of my father being diagnosed as a diabetic. He had acquaintances who were dependent on injecting insulin, and he didn't like that idea. He wasted away to less than 100 pounds before finding old books describing the use of brewer's yeast. For a few weeks, he lived on pure brewer's yeast. He completely overcame the conversion of food to glucose in the urine, put on weight, and lived 45 more years.

That caused me to ask people how their diabetes was diagnosed. Over 40 or 50 years, I've only found two or three people who had a sane diagnosis. In the 1940s, it was known that excessive cortisol would create all the symptoms of diabetes—wasting away of muscles and tissues, turning them into glucose. But practically, doctors simply look for high blood sugar and prescribe insulin. I don't recall running into someone whose cortisol, prolactin, parathyroid hormone, and growth hormone were considered in the diagnosis.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you see diabetes as pancreatic islet cell destruction, or a different process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It becomes a side effect of whatever is stressing you. Malnutrition, emotional stress, or overwork can cause high cortisol, which damages the beta cells. Mobilizing fats from storage during stress—or a lack of sleep—creates a diabetic condition.

When you treat it improperly, you keep exposing the pancreas to toxic free fatty acids. It turns out that glucose, when predominant in the blood, causes regeneration and differentiation of new beta cells from stem cells. But when you are under stress and improperly treated, free fatty acids and cortisol kill the new cells.

## Sleep, Stress, and Energy

**Andrew Murray:** Moving to this month's topic: Sleep and Aging. Do you see sleep as necessary for brain repair, energy renewal, or tissue repair?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body can't repair itself unless it has a brain in good working order, but the brain itself is the most sensitive thing to stress. When the brain can't repair itself and impose the resting state on the organism, you get a chronic excess of free fatty acids and cortisol, which destroy the pancreas and other organs.

**Andrew Murray:** So stress hormones directly affect sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When blood sugar isn't able to produce the carbon dioxide it should, it is wasted and becomes lactic acid. This raises the pH of the cell interior, creating a catabolic, excited state. Brain cells ultimately die or are blocked.

In reaction to falling glucose oxidation, adrenaline rises. Adrenaline should bring up glucose and stop the stress reaction. But if you don't have enough stored glucose, you resort to cortisol. Cortisol provides glucose by breaking down muscle, thymus, and skin cells. If that continues, you get a chronic stress cycle: low blood sugar, increased adrenaline, increased cortisol, and breakdown.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding how scientists view the brain, there is the "cognitive scientist" view of the brain as a computer, versus the cybernetic view of it as an autonomous system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Norbert Wiener, who invented cybernetics, was probably the best information theorist regarding the brain. He saw it as a control mechanism integrated intimately with the metabolism of the body. Relative to Wiener's view, I think you could consider the average cognitive scientist as somewhat autistic or abstract—out of reality.

**Andrew Murray:** We've discussed the Achilles tendon reflex as an indicator of hypothyroidism. A slow return to the resting state shows the cell has been overstimulated. Is this inability to relax related to energy production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you compare the brain to a cramping calf muscle in the Achilles reflex, a cancer cell is an energy-deprived, over-excited cell. It has the exact situation of the fatigued brain or cramping muscle. Deficiency of sugar or oxygen will cause cramping in muscles, insomnia or seizure in the brain, and compulsive growth in a cancer cell.

**Andrew Murray:** So "excitotoxicity" would refer to cancer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some doctors have mentioned you could diagnose cancerous lymph nodes in the armpit just by touching them. Cancer cells are hardened the same way a cramped muscle is hardened. It should be relaxed and full of energy, but it is in a cramped working state.

## Caller: Skin Rash and Sleep Issues

**Caller (Brooklyn):** About a month ago, out of the blue, I developed a red, bumpy rash on my neck and arms. It feels like a little fibrosis. At night, it wakes me up between 1:00 and 2:00 AM. I went to a dermatologist who prescribed Triamcinolone acetonide cream, but I didn't fill it because of the side effects regarding Cushing's syndrome. It's been 30 days and it's becoming chronic. I'm on a Ray Peat-style diet, which has been positive otherwise. Do you have any commentary on the sleep issue and the rash?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing I do for a symptom like that is put a couple of pounds of sodium chloride (salt) and about a pound of baking soda in a bathtub to make a slightly hyperosmotic solution. Soak in it for half an hour. That usually takes care of minor skin problems. It has much of the soothing effect that glucocorticoids like Triamcinolone have, but without making you sick in the long run.

**Caller (Brooklyn):** Is that a pound of baking soda and a pound of sodium chloride?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something like that. It doesn't have to be exact, but it can be up to two or three times as concentrated as seawater.

**Caller (Brooklyn):** Is the dry CO2 bath worth doing too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The baking soda has that function because the sodium holds the bicarbonate in solution. Your body has a high affinity for carbon dioxide and will pull the bicarbonate in. A pure CO2 dry bath instantly starts raising your body's carbon dioxide with anti-inflammatory effects.

**Caller (Brooklyn):** Regarding the sleep—I wake up, have a carrot salad and milk, use a red lamp, and go back to sleep. But it's a lot of work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main thing causing age-related interrupted sleep is decreased thyroid function slowing digestive processes. As blood sugar falls in darkness, you experience a toxic reaction to whatever is in your intestine. Irritation, inflammation, absorption of endotoxin, and surges of serotonin from the intestine get into the bloodstream, finish off your stored glycogen, and wake you up with a stress reaction.

**Caller (Brooklyn):** What do you do to prevent this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have a carrot salad or cooked mushrooms—antiseptic fiber—in the early afternoon. Then, have a fairly low-protein, high-carbohydrate supper right before bed, like ice cream or salty chicken broth. The combination of salt and sugar helps relax the intestine for a longer period.

## Caller: Diabetes and Brewer's Yeast

**Caller (Arcata):** I have to inject insulin every day and am attracted to the idea of not doing that. Why does brewer's yeast work? Did your father eat nothing but brewer's yeast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the functions of brewer's yeast is the high niacin content. Niacin is very effective for lowering free fatty acids. Free fatty acids are the main things killing the beta cells. Niacin and sugar are two things that hold down the liberation of toxic free fatty acids. Anything you can do to interfere with those free fatty acids will help the pancreas heal.

## Water Consumption

**Andrew Murray:** I have a question here from Michael from Webway: "Can you talk a little about water? What is the best water and how much is important?" Dr. Peat, what is your opinion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are really thirsty, water is what you need. But if you are drinking milk and orange juice to get your calories, protein, and calcium, you usually don't need plain water. The amount of water you are taking in to get those nutrients is usually on the order of a gallon or so.

## Darkness, Cortisol, and Red Light

**Andrew Murray:** In your *Sleep and Aging* newsletter, you mentioned that the concentration of cortisol in the blood increases when the light is turned off. Darkness is a stimulus for cortisol production. You mentioned that pre-bedtime exposure to red light can mitigate this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A Chinese study found that red light not only improved the depth of sleep but also improved athletic performance the next day.

About 40 years ago, experiments showed that if a seed was exposed to UV light, it would show free radicals in an electron spin resonance machine for hours. But if they shined red light on it immediately after, it quenched the excited electrons instantly. Experiments with gamma rays on frogs showed the same thing; a lethal dose of gamma rays followed by red light prevented the frogs from dying.

**Andrew Murray:** How deep does red light penetrate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you put a flashlight under your hand in the dark, you see the red light coming right through. I once put a red light behind my thigh, and my whole thigh was illuminated bright red, except for the bone which left a shadow like an X-ray.

## Heart Failure and Insomnia

**Andrew Murray:** As people get older, they are often told they need less sleep. I think they need the same amount but get less relaxation. Is the heart failure seen in the elderly related to this inability to relax, similar to insomnia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's exactly the same thing. The heart doesn't beat strongly because it doesn't relax fully—the diastolic relaxation isn't there as energy production decreases. The brain's relaxation is impaired in the same way.

## Pregnenolone Steal

**Andrew Murray:** A listener asked about "pregnenolone steal," where people with worn-out adrenals supposedly have pregnenolone stolen to convert into cortisol. Is that possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Whenever you are making cortisol, you are making it from pregnenolone. You should have a huge excess of pregnenolone and progesterone and only make small amounts of the terminal hormones like cortisol and estrogen. The bulk of steroids should be stabilizing materials like pregnenolone. I don't even consider those to be hormones. Pregnenolone helps tissues give up excess water and allows the fascia to regain normal tone. It can make wrinkles in sagging neck skin disappear.

## Caller: Red Light Specifics

**Caller (Wilder Ridge):** I wanted to know about the red light. Is it a specific bulb?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sunlight or any incandescent light bulb has the full red spectrum. The middle of the sun's spectrum is yellow; the middle of an incandescent bulb is orange. You get the benefit from either. For convenience, you might not want a bright room when trying to relax. I use a 250-watt infrared reflector bulb. It looks like a white light but runs at a lower temperature, so it is heavier on the red part of the spectrum. You don't need the blue and green part for the therapeutic effect.

## Caller: Pregnenolone and Water in Aging

**Caller (New York):** How do you know if you need pregnenolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1980s, healthy people in their 30s felt nothing when taking it. But when someone was in their late 40s or 50s and feeling helpless or depressed, even a pinch (15 or 20 mg) would make their faces light up in 15 minutes. When you need it, it's a very vivid effect.

**Caller (New York):** Regarding water—babies are 80% water and older people are 55%. If you drop to a lower percentage as you age, shouldn't you drink more water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is about organized water. CO2, ATP, pregnenolone, and progesterone hold good water in the cells while squeezing out unwanted, disorganized water. Old people often take up cellular water that isn't organized. You can restore metabolic active water with progesterone, pregnenolone, thyroid, and carbon dioxide.

**Caller (New York):** Lastly, what is the ratio for Vitamin A, D, and K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there is a definite ratio. As thyroid function increases, you are able to use lots of Vitamin A to make pregnenolone and progesterone. If your thyroid is low, too much Vitamin A interferes and lowers thyroid function further.

**Andrew Murray:** And cholesterol is the main building block for these hormones, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Cholesterol rises with age because low thyroid and low Vitamin A interfere with the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone and progesterone. The body compensates by increasing cholesterol.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to wrap it up. For those who want to find out more, Dr. Peat's website is [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). There are fully referenced articles there, including on diabetes and brewer's yeast. Thank you, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.

**Andrew Murray:** We will see you next month.
