# Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. This is *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville. My name is Andrew Murray. My wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists; we trained in England, graduated with a master's degree in herbal medicine, and run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

Tonight, you are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject: memory, cognition, and nutrition. We have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. Dr. Peat, could you give us a synopsis of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the last 40 years, I've been studying independently. Before that, from 1968 to 1972, I was a graduate student in biology at the University of Oregon for a PhD in biology, specializing in physiology. In the late 50s, I worked on a master's degree at the University of Oregon, taking courses in philosophy and psychology. The reason I decided to study biology was that I didn't think people were working on consciousness in the right way. I thought I could come at it biologically.

## Nutrition and Consciousness: The Dostoevsky Connection

**Andrew Murray:** Tonight's topic is cognition, memory, and the nutrition that supports successful memory forming and retention. When looking at the pioneers of this subject in the last hundred years, there are many Russians involved. You previously mentioned Fyodor Dostoevsky and gave an anecdote about a change in his perception and cognition as a result of imprisonment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A biography written by Jim Rice, a professor at the University of Oregon, tells the story about how Dostoevsky's nervous problems improved while he was in prison in Siberia. One of the odd things was that he began eating chopped meat because that was available in the prison. In the winter, they didn't have vegetables, so they had to hunt. His consciousness improved, and the professor thought there might have been a nutritional aspect to this change.

**Andrew Murray:** Are you supporting the necessary protein requirement in the diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are seriously deficient in protein, it absolutely affects your consciousness. A professor friend of mine in Mexico said that when some of his students couldn't memorize things, he encouraged them to eat some protein. When I was teaching language classes in Mexico City, some of my students absolutely couldn't remember anything. I would start my classes by serving cookies I made out of eggs, sugar, and wheat germ alongside a cup of coffee. Everyone was able to learn their lessons just from that little extra boost of protein, carbohydrate, and coffee.

## The Mechanistic vs. Resonance View of the Brain

**Andrew Murray:** Let's explore the philosophy behind current thinking. How have you seen the development of our understanding of the conscious versus the unconscious?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dostoevsky wrote *The Dream of a Ridiculous Man*, in which the hero is suicidal because he sees the world as full of robots—people operating according to cause and effect, doing nothing other than what they are determined to do. At the time he was writing, Europe was being swept by the mechanistic idea. Thomas Huxley, a friend of Charles Darwin, advocated the idea that molecules in the brain are absolutely in control of our thoughts, and our mind is simply a shadow of this determined mechanism.

That idea has persisted. In my generation, the outstanding figure has been Noam Chomsky, with his idea that genes determine "transformational rules" that limit or determine the form language takes. Cognitive science and artificial intelligence are closely related to the Chomsky position, using the digital computer as a model for understanding human intelligence. This has led to a digitalization of consciousness theories.

**Andrew Murray:** You are saying that Chomsky's position was allied to the digital model?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The idea that brain cells communicate according to an "on/off" or "all-or-nothing" signaling was derived from the quantizing philosophy of the digital computer switch. Biology took this up, assuming that when a nerve fires, that is one bit of information.

However, P.K. Anokhin in Russia was critical of that idea. Many people noticed you can't explain hearing—the full range of volume, frequency, and tonal quality—if nerves are only on/off switches. Anokhin showed that it is likely impossible to explain brain function using the analogy of a computer using binary digits.

**Andrew Murray:** There certainly is much more to thinking and cognition than just straight on/off electrical impulses.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Anokhin's view, it would be more like a picture traveling down each nerve, transmitting complex information. The essential ideas here are resonance and coherence—the interrelatedness of things separated in space and time.

These ideas were part of biology back when Gestalt psychology was current in the 30s and 40s. They argued that the Gestalt was an image having a space-filling function in the brain, reflecting the spatial and temporal arrangement in the real world. For example, in the nose, a molecule vibrating would stimulate an analogous vibration so that the actual aroma would be reproduced along the nerve and in the brain. Or when light is absorbed by a Vitamin A molecule in the retina, it would excite a resonance of a similar luminous quality. In the Gestalt view, you would actually have something like a luminous event in the brain when you saw light in the world.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that resonance similar to the concept of extra-sensory perception being transmitted across space?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are experiments currently going on regarding this. Michael Persinger, a neurologist, has argued for a resonance between everyone's brain and the electromagnetic resonance frequencies of the earth environment.

**Andrew Murray:** I recall the concept of the "noosphere" proposed by Vladimir Vernadsky.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the priest Teilhard de Chardin followed Vernadsky's idea of the world becoming more and more conscious, supporting the growth of more conscious organisms.

## Music Therapy and Time Perception

**Caller (Jeff from Mendocino):** I have heard of cases where music is used for therapy for people who are comatose or have spinal injuries. It seems magical and medicinal. Since everything is vibrating, including string theory, how do you respond to the idea of music helping people come back?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's something much more subtle but more powerful than endorphins. I think the very structure of nerves is a kind of resonance and carries a function that is analogous to objective music outside the body. When you give the organism a chance to relax and respond to music, you're reinforcing a process that is basic to the life of the brain cells.

If you believed in the mechanistic interpretation of consciousness, you would see the present moment as an infinitesimally thin division between past and future. But the unreality of that is clear when you listen to music. A performer or director has to see where the particular moment is going and where it has been. The pace and qualities developing in each moment depend on what you perceive is coming and what has recently passed. The brain is like a musical composition that doesn't exist only in the present; the moment of consciousness spans time.

## Anxiety, Posture, and Glucose

**Andrew Murray:** That reminds me of Buddhist teachings on stilling the mind. You once mentioned a test where people performed measurably better when lying down versus standing up. How do you see stilling the mind as a mechanism for better brain function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's a matter of the breadth of time in your consciousness. When you're standing up, you're ready to react quickly to a short-term influence. When you're lying down, your reference of meaning goes out further in all directions. What you're going to do and what you've been doing come into the picture.

When you're under stress, glucose is the immediate source of energy. Glucose is the material that keeps that conscious process possible. If you are under stress and using glucose too fast, or don't have enough available, your nervous processes go into an emergency state where only the immediate present is relevant. Anxiety associated with hypoglycemia or stress will flatten the way your consciousness works.

**Andrew Murray:** Once again, we are touting glucose as positive and energetic, despite the media saying sugar is bad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person has been under stress and not eating well, besides protein, Vitamin B1 is sometimes the thing that can make the biggest difference. A mild deficiency can make you feel sluggish, depressed, and have poor short-term memory.

**Andrew Murray:** What kind of dose is physiologically sufficient?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've experienced it with as little as 10 milligrams, but for an emergency, 100 milligrams is okay.

## Olfactory Stimulation and Memory

**Caller (New Jersey):** I read a quote about how neurogenesis can take place in the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. Can one go around smelling things to start firing neurons or creating new neurons?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Luca Turin, a perfume specialist, has some very good videos on the internet regarding olfaction. Along with Heraclitus, who talked about the nose as being at the center of consciousness, the olfactory system is very closely connected with our highest conceptual work.

Becoming conscious of odors in your environment is closely connected with the higher parts of the brain. You can use odors to stimulate memory. Any type of experience helps stimulate the hippocampus. For example, taxi drivers in big cities who have learned all the streets have a bigger hippocampus.

The mechanists proposed an idea of memory like a computer, where you punch a hole in a card or put a signal on a tape—a definite thing you could go back and find. They suggested we make a specific protein or RNA molecule for memory. But if you think about the process you would have to go through to *find* the right memory molecule when you needed it, the apparatus used to find that molecule implies you already know where the memory is. So, you already have the memory, in effect. Otherwise, molecules would just be jumping at you randomly.

## Nutritional Factors for Cognition

**Andrew Murray:** Let's get back to nutrition. You mentioned B1 deficiency. Apart from sunflower seeds and bread, what are good sources of B1?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the animal foods: eggs, milk, cheese.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to question you about Vitamin A. You linked this with anxiety.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin A acts as an antenna for interacting with electromagnetic energy, but it also activates the enzymes that make steroids—especially brain steroids. If your Vitamin A is deficient, your ability to make pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA is limited. The brain is probably the most powerful steroid-forming organ when it's working right.

**Andrew Murray:** What about fish oils? I know there is a misplaced belief that they are good for you, but halibut liver oil has concentrated Vitamin A and little PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Halibut liver oil gives you a lot of Vitamin A, some Vitamin D, and traces of Vitamin E without too much of the PUFA. It's a good source. Liver itself—fish, chicken, or beef—is a great source. Also eggs, milk, and cheese. Vitamin B12 happens to be crucial for turning carotene into Vitamin A.

**Andrew Murray:** What consumes Vitamin A?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ultraviolet exposure destroys it very easily in your skin. Vitamin A reacts with the ultraviolet and spreads damage to any unsaturated fats in your skin. Vitamin E protects against that breakdown.

**Andrew Murray:** Are there other factors that increase the ability to retain information?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Serotonin. When you are under stress or eating irritating foods, your intestine gets inflamed and releases extra serotonin. Some of it gets to the brain and signals the stress system. Endotoxin triggers nitric oxide and serotonin. Various types of stress and depression tend to slow nerve function. If you feed rats beans containing soluble fibers that feed bacteria, creating irritation and increasing serotonin, the rats become anxious, aggressive, and fearful.

**Andrew Murray:** So anxiety is one of the main things to avoid for competent memory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And hyperventilation. When you are anxious, it is common to breathe harder and lose carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide seems to be a nerve stabilizer. As CO2 goes down, your platelets release more serotonin. Anything that increases your ability to retain carbon dioxide tends to help you think calmly and clearly.

**Andrew Murray:** And thyroid helps you retain CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone. Also, keeping your brain warm. Just running at a higher temperature, your brain produces more CO2 and generally retains magnesium more efficiently. I've known many people with memory problems who had a body temperature of 96 or 97 degrees. Getting their temperature up toward 98 or 99 degrees improved their memory tremendously.

**Andrew Murray:** What about sodium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress and aging tend to make it harder to retain sodium. Thyroid is an important factor in retaining sodium so it isn't lost in the urine. When your body senses a loss of sodium, the adrenals produce aldosterone to save the sodium. However, aldosterone tells the kidneys to lose magnesium. So, if you take enough sodium to keep your adrenals from making aldosterone, your kidneys will save magnesium. Eating extra salt is equivalent to having more magnesium in your diet.

**Andrew Murray:** So salt, protein, progesterone, and thyroid are the main things for keeping the brain functioning well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.
