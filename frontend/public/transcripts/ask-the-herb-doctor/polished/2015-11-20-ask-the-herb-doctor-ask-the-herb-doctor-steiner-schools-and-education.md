## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. Clients consult with us regarding their health issues, and we recommend personalized advice in nutrition, supplements, herbs, diet, and lifestyle.

For this month's show, Dr. Raymond Peat is going to join us. We're fortunate to have him on the show, and I know people who listen frequently have heard Dr. Peat speak on a very wide range of topics. Tonight is no exception. I want to bring out the topic of Steiner schools, Rudolf Steiner, anthroposophy, and biodynamic gardening. It all ties into itself as a complete system that Rudolf Steiner brought out in the early 1900s. Dr. Peat has his own very pertinent and personal background in education.

Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. For those who have just tuned in for the first time, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied humanities as an undergraduate and eventually went to graduate school in biology, although linguistics and painting had been most of my previous study. Since graduating with a PhD in biology, I've done a lot of counseling in nutrition and general health issues.

## The Blake College Experiment

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of your life's work and education, would you want to mention anything about a college that you were part of at one time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is very directly related to everything I did before and after. I had been a critical consumer of education right from the first grade. I knew how to read when I went to school, so I didn't take it very seriously when they went through their routines. My third, fourth, and fifth-grade experience was exceptional; it was in a one-room country school where there were eight grades in one room. That made it more interesting, and it was completely unregimented. I think that gave me the idea that maybe kids would do better in a freer learning environment.

In my college experience, I found that there were only two or three professors that knew anything that I wanted to learn. My first teaching experience confirmed my belief that the institution tended to be an impediment to learning. The trustees had their idea of what the students should do with their lives, and the students' and teachers' interests were antagonistic to the trustees. As a result, I got the idea of starting a school in Mexico where we could be somewhat beyond the reach of the trustees and government types who wanted to tell us what we couldn't study.

**Andrew Murray:** What year was this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 1961. I had been reading and studying William Blake's work, so I named the school Blake College. The idea was that we would incorporate it, but the students and teachers would be the only trustees. There would be no curriculum. Students could bring up topics they wanted to study, and instructors could offer courses students didn't have to attend—just complete independence.

We had the idea that since the students would use their bachelor's degree to go on for a master's or PhD, the requirement for getting a degree should be passing the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) that students normally take to qualify for graduate school.

**Andrew Murray:** That is an established standard in the US?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was a very standardized system at that time. We said that if a student could pass at the 87th percentile of American college graduates on that test, they could have their degree, because practically any graduate school in the country would be willing to have someone who scored in the upper 12%.

As it turned out, students generally chose to take that exam after being there only six, seven, or eight months, and their average was over the 90th percentile. No one flunked the tests. You could see the process happening. People would come thinking that they needed to be structured somehow, but what they learned was that they were full of knowledge. Their business was to structure reality for themselves—to make sense out of what they already knew and use that orientation to ask questions about what they really wanted to learn. You could see a very quick change in their sense of confidence about knowledge.

**Andrew Murray:** So within a few months, the students could take this exam and score in the 90th percentile? How much of that was due to them being the "right" kind of people who would choose that environment versus what they learned while they were there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of them had been flunk-outs at state universities. A couple of them had even scored poorly on standardized tests and thought they were idiots. When they had the opportunity not to be imposed upon and to be able to talk to other students and teachers, they realized how much they knew. You could see the change from someone who felt helpless coming around to seeing themselves as a responsible citizen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And did they get accepted into graduate schools?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the state schools said that simply having that high score wasn't enough, so some had to go to private graduate schools. But all of the good schools let them in on the basis of their scores without having had their previous bachelor's or master's.

## Student-Centered Education vs. The Curriculum

**Andrew Murray:** This ties in well with the Steiner school environment. Steiner schools have a very different approach to problem-solving. You mentioned there was no curriculum at Blake College?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically. We only paid a couple of professors; there just wasn't enough money. But there were well-known people—painters, philosophy professors, psychology professors, writers, and even a math professor—doing it just for fun. They would usually end up saying they were learning more from the students than they had to teach the students.

When you look at the ideology of public education over the last couple of hundred years, you see that a whole theory of what an organism is is related to the theory of education. What they're doing is based on an authoritarian social system that relies on a mechanical conception of what the person is. The progress of biological knowledge in the last 50 years has illuminated some of the problems with that theory. The brain is the body's energy organizing system. If you have education that conflicts with the body's own processes, you're going to impair the body's energy system, lead to a reduction of ability, and create a tendency toward a lack of adaptability in biological as well as mental health processes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Are you speaking about children being forced to sit for eight hours a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies in New York City where kids were given an IQ test every year. They saw these slum kids coming in with an average IQ, but each year their scores would get lower as they spent the year sitting in school being oppressed. With our students at Blake, just the opposite happened very quickly. They would come out of their oppression and realize that they were creative minds. That same process was discovered 50 years ago in rat studies. The rat that was given an entertaining, free environment became more intelligent and grew a bigger brain with a thicker cortex. Their offspring would have a bigger brain and be more intelligent.

**Andrew Murray:** Steiner used a humor classification of personalities—melancholic, sanguine, phlegmatic, and choleric—to guide education. What do you think about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We called it student-centered education. Following Carl Rogers' client-centered therapy, he used a non-directive approach of empathy. In our non-curriculum, the sense of empathy was the guiding principle. The teachers and students tried to understand each other and together created questions that none of them had thought about before. If you had them categorized according to humors, that would be a way of organizing that process. With our small group, it was a purely individual, adaptive, empathetic approach.

**Andrew Murray:** Steiner students were taught to observe and depict scientific concepts in their own words and drawings rather than encountering ideas through textbooks. These students were shown to have an above-average number of doctors, engineers, and scientists because they investigated the world objectively.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The typical professor has his understanding of how a student's brain works, and they think they have to impose their abstractions—such as the science textbook idea—on the student's brain. But the actuality of a student's brain and personality is analogous to any organism. A simple mammal, for example, understands physics very well. Birds, crows in particular, are very intelligent and can figure out physical processes and make predictions that many graduate students in physics wouldn't understand.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They can predict that if you left the meat out on that rock the day before, it might be there the next day at the same time.

## Reading and Natural Development

**Andrew Murray:** In Steiner education, from ages three to seven, there is no pressure to learn ABCs. The child is immersed in nature, gardening, and animals before they do anything structured with math and science.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think they don't read until they're ten on average.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In my experience, I saw people reading and talking about things they saw in the newspapers. I just spontaneously wanted to see what they were doing; it had nothing to do with a curriculum or being taught.

At the Summerhill School, started by A.S. Neill in England in the 1920s, he had no curriculum at all. Students could stay there for 12 years if they wanted and not study. But the ones who did stay and graduate were superior in their achievement to those who had gone through taking classes every day for 12 years. They demonstrated that the curriculum is completely unnecessary. If the student is aware that there is something to learn, they can learn it in a flash compared to what the schools expect of them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't you tell me you learned to read watching people read the newspaper because you wanted to read the comics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The funnies were the first things—*Alley Oop* and *Smokey Stover* were my favorites. But then my parents had a shoebox full of the "Little Blue Books," classics printed in a very small size. And regarding the newspapers, I wanted to hear what was going on with the war. So I learned the various types of things that were available.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How old were you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Four.

## Homeschooling and Institutional Control

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about the concepts of homeschooling? State schools obviously have their own agendas.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the state can set the curriculum to a great extent, even in homeschooling. The federal government approves the agencies that accredit high schools and universities. There are private accrediting agencies which are really responsible to no one; they are an abstract authority that citizens can't affect directly. The state bureaucracies are set up so that no school can grant degrees or transcripts if they don't conform to those accrediting agencies. So the power to grant a degree is pretty much a matter of mind control.

In my experience in grade school and high school, I just didn't pay too much attention to them. In high school, some of our teachers were openly fascists, Hitler worshipers, and racists. It was just a matter of getting through it without having to interact too much with them.

**Andrew Murray:** You often bring to life concepts that aren't found in mainstream medical journals. You mentioned that when you were studying, most of your professors didn't understand what you were trying to get across because it wasn't typical rote repetition.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The system—not only the explicit accrediting process but the official high-status publications and journals—all have ulterior motives. You have to look for people who are motivated by reality. Remember a few years ago someone in the White House said, "Your problem is that you belong to the reality-based community. We're creating a new reality; you're studying the old one." I think there is a possibility still in the reality-based community.

## Caller: Self-Education in Biology

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller from Colorado Springs.

**Caller:** Dr. Peat, I was wondering if you had any suggestions for a person that wants to self-educate in biology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having access to a really good university library is important. The journals are too expensive; even buying articles over the internet costs $30 or $40 per article. If you have a good science library nearby, you can find journals, recent books, and old books. If you have questions, just start looking them up in the library. Sometimes professors can be helpful if they don't know what your real purpose is.

**Caller:** Do you have any specific textbook suggestions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. There were good textbooks published many years ago, but in the last 10 or 20 years, even the textbooks that were good have been revised under the name of the good author by committees. These committees look for the professors who have the biggest classes. They say something nice in the textbook about the work of that professor, which means they sell an extra 500 books at $100 profit each. Textbooks have become a matter of profit for the publisher rather than information for the student.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't you recommend a physiology textbook from the 50s or 60s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are some good ones from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. I have a little *Handbook of Physiology* from about 1965 that has the basic information and doesn't have the misleading stuff on membrane pumps and channels.

**Andrew Murray:** What was the name of the index you mentioned at the university in Oregon? You said *Index Medicus* lagged behind?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was *Biological Abstracts*, which had references to international journals in all fields related to biology. When I would compare *Index Medicus*—which was the paper precursor to PubMed—I found that any interesting discovery of recent years found in *Biological Abstracts* took about 10 or 20 years to show up in *Index Medicus*. And then it would often be a put-down. They would scoff for a few years, and then 30 years after it was published in the science literature, the medical literature would finally accept it.

## Biodynamics and Biological Fields

**Andrew Murray:** I want to touch on medicinals and anthroposophy. You mentioned Iscador, which is an anthroposophical preparation of *Viscum album* (European mistletoe).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been following the issue for more than 50 years. I knew people in the biodynamic Steiner approach, and they told me interesting things about the influence of fields created by the moon cycles. Following up on that, I found there were fairly mainline researchers continuing ideas that Steiner had proposed regarding the interaction between moon cycles and botanical processes. From the 20s through the 40s, there were several people doing very good research showing that organisms are biologically coordinated through the earth and moon fields.

**Andrew Murray:** That's the basis for lunar planting.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For people who want background besides Steiner, Harold Saxton Burr wrote a book called *Fields of Life*. He was a Yale professor who did measurements showing these lunar cycles. A professor named Brown at Indiana University did a whole series of biological cycle studies. Solco Tromp was a Dutch biologist and ecologist who wrote a book called *Psychical Physics* about how the nervous system interacts with these fields.

## The Physiology of Stress

**Andrew Murray:** Steiner students had a statistically significant lower incidence of gastrointestinal distress compared to mainstream students. What do you think about the mind-body connection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The issue of learned helplessness, or inescapable stress, shows up first in the stomach as ulcers and in the intestine as bleeding, but it's really happening in the brain. If it continues, you can see with MRI studies that chronic stress thins the cortex of the brain.

The main parts of the brain that relate the digestive damage to the nerve damage involve the serotonin system and toxic excitatory amino acids. Glutamic excitation processes release nitric oxide. Nitric oxide reduces the energy-producing capacity of the brain and leads to atrophy. The intestine releases both serotonin and nitric oxide. The system goes back and forth between the brain and the intestine, affecting every other organ.

You can see these same processes even in fruit flies. If a fruit fly has a traumatic brain injury, it develops ulcers and a leaky intestine.

**Andrew Murray:** Really?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruit flies are just like us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That makes me think of lemon balm because it's calming on the nervous system but also soothing on the intestinal tract.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping the brain steroids up and the inhibitory GABA transmitters up preserves the brain and all of the organs. Keeping the brain energy up keeps the structure up.

## Caller: Digestive Health and Seeds

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller from Windsor, Ontario.

**Caller:** As far as intestinal problems go, I was wondering how Dr. Peat felt about Chia seeds? They seem to help with stomach problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're good for making funny fuzzy animals.

**Caller:** But not for eating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I don't really know any virtue they have as a food.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They are very mucilaginous.

**Caller:** But the Omega-3s in them aren't bad for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There isn't much. I think the risk is an allergic reaction to some of the proteins in them.

**Caller:** The other thing that's helped is Shirataki noodles. They are made from Konjac root.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yes. I read that they were having a problem with people choking.

**Caller:** They don't digest, but they really help with bowel movements.

**Andrew Murray:** Cascara does the same thing for bowel movements, and it's a lot safer.

**Caller:** I found anytime I ate the Chia seeds or the Konjac noodles, the bowel movements are perfect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat always recommends carrots, but he doesn't like seeds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know psyllium seeds work for many people, but I've known a few people who had a bad reaction to them.

**Caller:** I've tried psyllium and had cramps.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Then you're obviously having that allergic reaction.

## Cataracts and Lanosterol

**Andrew Murray:** We only have a few moments left, but I want to ask you about the latest findings on a product called lanosterol and its use in the treatment of cataracts without surgery.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was just a little surprised to see a big publication in *Nature*. A group at the University of California, San Diego, was actually reversing the majority of cataracts in rabbits and dogs, using both eyedrops and injections. They actually got established cataracts to clear up.

When I wrote a newsletter about cataracts a couple of years ago, I noticed that research in treating and curing cataracts had been suppressed because of the immense amount of money there is in removing the lens. Cataract surgery is a multi-billion dollar business. That money interest had just wiped out practically all curative research.

**Andrew Murray:** We'll keep our eyes open for lanosterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mushrooms happen to be a good source of that steroid. It is a precursor to cholesterol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So boil your mushrooms for 45 minutes to an hour and make a yummy winter soup.

**Andrew Murray:** And don't think of cholesterol as a bad thing, because it's not. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.
