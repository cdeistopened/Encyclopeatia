## Introduction: The Precautionary Principle

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists practicing here in Northern California. We see a wide range of people and are increasingly consulting with people by telephone across the country. We are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, Ph.D., who has spent the last 50 years in research and providing a wealth of newsletters. He is very altruistic and gives his time freely to answer questions.

Tonight's subject is the "Precautionary Principle." This term is not a new concept; it has its roots in antiquity and is the maxim supporting the heritage of herbal medicine: *First, do no harm*. The Hippocratic oath, by which all practitioners of medicine still swear allegiance, is the same. However, modern practices have swerved off the road and are far from the straight and narrow path leading to safe and effective medicines.

We know the Greek legend of Pandora and her box; once opened, it could never be put back, and the price to humanity was great. Why does nature not come up with the best way forward, and why do we seek to usurp it rather than learn from it? GMOs, for example, are very contentious. It defies logic to have Chernobyls and Fukushimas with waste lasting millennia.

The precautionary principle, as applied to medicines and foods, can be seen in Europe where it is codified into law, but purposely not here in the US. The United States has opposed the use of the term "principle" because this term has special connotations in legal language; a principle of law is a source of law. In the European Union, this has informed policy regarding product safety, additives, waste incineration, and GMOs.

Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. Getting into the precautionary principle—given that it is law in Europe and not here—where are you most intimately concerned with this for the good of change?

## Natural vs. Synthetic Molecules

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just after I got out of graduate school and was doing consulting, people were talking about whether natural remedies were any better than pharmaceutical chemical remedies. That started me thinking about what the difference really is.

A substance such as progesterone is a good illustration. Just yesterday someone told me the story of his wife being prescribed a new synthetic progestin. I looked up some articles on it, and they described it as being designed to resemble as closely as possible the natural molecule progesterone. A couple of other molecules in the last 10 years have claimed that they are closer than any of the other synthetic progestins to natural progesterone.

It is very interesting that progesterone has existed in animals since animals began. These other substances—in the case of this recent one—have existed in the universe for only 10 years. We pretty well know that natural progesterone is safe because it has been doing its thing in organisms forever. This new one has a cyanide group attached to it that never was attached to a natural steroid molecule. So, it is undoubtedly doing many things that natural progesterone doesn't do. How soon will we know what the ultimate side effects of this historically unique intervention will be? What will they be 100 years from now in the descendants of the people who are being treated with it now?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why did they put the cyanide on there? Is that to make it a patentable medicine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's part of it. They are making things as close to progesterone as they can, but they can't patent progesterone. The actual natural substance is cheap, and the drug companies aren't interested in promoting something with very little profit because everyone can compete.

When you use herbal remedies, even if there is one specific active agent you're looking for—like in foxglove—you're not only going to have supporting surrounding metabolites that are acting somewhat like drugs, but you know that the natural form of the molecule has existed in plant cells since the plant became what it is. The structure and biochemistry of plant and animal cells are very similar. We have the same basic types of enzymes and energy-producing reactions. We know that those molecules are compatible with at least many kinds of life. If you invent a molecule, it might seem very similar, but you really can't know until you have tried it for the whole lifetime of a particular organism.

## The Legacy of DES and Epigenetics

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the case of diethylstilbestrol (DES), it was introduced to treat menopause and to improve pregnancy. It was called the "female hormone." The argument was that if you were having trouble carrying a pregnancy, it was because something was defective in your femaleness, so they gave you more of the female hormone. There were already many things known about the harm of the molecule at that time, but it was given to millions of women.

Twenty or thirty years later, they were seeing that the children—both male and female—and even the grandchildren apparently have been injured by their mother's use of this synthetic estrogen. That shows that the development of sickness, such as cancer, might not show up until 40 years after the exposure. With a six-month animal study, you aren't going to have a clue as to whether it might cause cancer in the old age of the person who uses it, or even in their children.

In the last 15 or 20 years, the idea of epigenetic change has been accepted. What you do to one individual is now recognized to have effects several generations into the future. One of those common effects, which is now recognized as a type of epigenetic change or damage, is called genomic instability. The DNA might not be mutated in the first day or year of exposure, but the genome itself becomes destabilized even in subsequent generations, so that mutations are created later.

Estrogen and ionizing radiation have many overlapping similarities. You can get a synergy between a certain dose of radiation and a certain dose of estrogen which is more than additive. It's like adding extra radiation to an X-ray if you have an exposure to estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's like a potentiating effect.

## Corporate Fraud and Liability

**Andrew Murray:** The precautionary principle in the EU seeks to bring legal action against malfeasant activities by companies who bring a product to market and subsequently harm people because they didn't do enough testing or covered it up. The whole tenet of "first do no harm" goes hand in hand with being totally honest and scientific so that you're open to scrutiny.

We mentioned Chris Busby in England earlier. He is bringing up the "Euratom suicide clause." He notes that many more deaths have been attributed to radioactive waste—whether from Sellafield, Chernobyl, or Fukushima. He states that the relative risk was downplayed by the American government to maintain research, and the actual death toll is much higher, amounting to corporate manslaughter.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, if some of these drugs are causing genetic problems and cancers 40 years later, how can drug companies test these products safely? Would they have seen some problems within a reasonable amount of time in animal studies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. By the 1930s, years before the estrogens came on the pharmaceutical market, they were already identified as very potent carcinogens and promoters of brain defects, movement disorders, personality changes, inflammation, and cancer in every organ of the body. They were also identified as abortifacients. Estrogen was clearly identified before 1940 as a powerful birth control or early abortifacient agent. Despite that, it was sold for almost 20 years to prevent miscarriage—exactly the opposite of what it was known to do. Fraud was the driving force behind the whole estrogen replacement therapy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you think about new drugs? Do you think there are ways to safely test them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Often they currently have the knowledge and hide it or don't want to look for it. If someone suspects it might have a certain kind of effect, they will carefully avoid discussion of the mechanisms that could cause it to be harmful in their applications for approval.

The whole DNA revolution happened at the same time that biology was being shifted over to a study of the DNA molecule rather than the actual facts of inheritance. I see it as a coordinated effort, sponsored by the government, to support industry in its ability to evade responsibility. If you look at ordinary liability principles in law, it would make it impossible for many of these industries to function. The insurance needed for a nuclear plant or for vaccines would be prohibitive.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So because the insurance would be so great, they get off without having to get any insurance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even without putting this explicitly into the law as indemnification beforehand, the cleanup projects of the great chemical contaminants around the country are being done at public taxpayer expense rather than holding the profiting corporations responsible.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's a win-win for the offending corporations and a lose-lose for the taxpayers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The government is not only working for the corporations in their immediate liabilities, but if you go back to the late 1930s, the government has intervened in the very nature of how science is done. If you look at ancient science from Aristotle down to the 19th century, cause and effect were central ideas. Around the middle of the last century, with quantum physics ideas, people started questioning whether cause and effect is a real thing. That is very nice for the polluting corporation. There are people now—foundations and lawyers hired by corporations—going around the country denying the common sense idea of cause and effect, saying that if you claim a product is dangerous, you have to prove *absolutely* that you are being harmed by it.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is the "get out" clause that America has, putting the responsibility on the consumer.

## Caller: Hormones and Thyroid Dosing

**Jeremy (Caller from Atlanta):** My wife and I have been PUFA-free for about two years. We've been trying to overcome her estrogen dominance. She is 32. Her waking temp was 94.9, and removing PUFAs got it up to 97.1. We started Dr. Lee's progesterone therapy, doing about 100mg a day. It started her cycles, but she still had PMS. I found some women were doing 700mg or more, so we increased her dose to 900mg per day topically, broken into three doses. She has been doing that since October.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that topical? And are you cycling it two weeks on, two weeks off?

**Jeremy:** No, because she is still continuing a two-week cycle. The flow never begins; she spots for three or four days and then it stops. I was concerned because that seems like an incredibly high dose. We are also doing desiccated beef thyroid, 40mg tablets, one an hour for 12 hours a day.

**Andrew Murray:** 480mg of desiccated thyroid is quite a bit. Dr. Peat, what do you think about this two-week cycle and that amount of thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With topical progesterone, depending on the vehicle, sometimes only a very tiny fraction—5% or less—is actually getting into the body. It's important to have a blood test occasionally.

The liver is always regulating the hormones. When you use progesterone all month, the liver develops the ability to excrete it quickly over the first two weeks. So in the following weeks, you're excreting it almost as fast as you can put it in. The natural cycle has a rest of two weeks where the liver resets itself so that a small amount will have a full effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why we recommend taking an internal progesterone, like Progest-E, and cycling it from full moon to new moon, then stopping from new moon to full moon. Hopefully, you'll get into a cycle where you're ovulating at the full moon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding the thyroid, products are extremely variable. It's important to watch for changes in temperature, pulse rate, color of lips, warmth of fingers, quality of sleep, and digestion. Usually, low thyroid/high estrogen people have digestive problems. Estrogen tends to recycle when your thyroid is low; it is reabsorbed after being excreted into the intestine. Fiber in the diet—a raw carrot every day—is sometimes enough to get the estrogen down so that cycles are normalized.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you want a temperature and pulse chart, email us. After eating, the temperature should go up to at least 98.2 or 98.6.

**Jeremy:** She has been hitting 98 after eating, and her waking temp hit 97.5 this morning. We are doing the raw carrot every day. I was just worried about the high dosing.

**Andrew Murray:** There is a wide range of doses people use. Dr. Peat, what do you think about the 40mg of desiccated thyroid every hour?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known people who needed that much of even Armour Thyroid. That would make a five-grain tablet of Armour. Even veterinarians would routinely prescribe that much for a cocker spaniel. It isn't unheard of to need that much, but it's important to watch for the signs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, 40mg of a beef glandular could be very different than 40mg of Armour Thyroid.

**Jeremy:** We ramped it up until she began to get nauseous, then backed it down. Her pulse has been in the mid-80s.

**Andrew Murray:** Symptoms of overdosing would be sweating with minimal exercise, breathlessness, excessive appetite, or a pulse over 100.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If she starts taking Progest-E internally, she'd probably want to start with an eighth of a teaspoon once or twice a day. An eighth of a teaspoon has 50mg of progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the cycling is very important—two weeks off every month.

## Caller: Baldness and Herniated Discs

**Caller (San Francisco Bay Area):** Two questions: What can a man do to reverse male pattern baldness? And how can someone heal a lower back herniated disc?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Baldness is often associated with low thyroid function. You should look at the whole picture of your cholesterol, body temperature, and energy needs. Specifically for the scalp, caffeine is a good stimulant of hair follicles. You can dissolve purified caffeine in rubbing alcohol, for example. DHEA is another natural hormone that sometimes activates hair follicle function.

For connective tissue and discs, DHEA and thyroid are crucial. If thyroid function is low, all connective tissues tend to be waterlogged, soft, and lacking elasticity. Normalizing your serum level of DHEA—which might only take 5mg a day—can have very quick, dramatic effects on connective tissues, ligaments, tendons, and discs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You must be careful with DHEA because it can raise your estradiol levels. You might want blood checks to make sure your hormone ratios are good.

**Andrew Murray:** The important thing with DHEA is to make sure your thyroid function is adequate, otherwise that conversion to estradiol is more likely to occur.

## Innovation vs. Regulation

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the precautionary principle: In this country, the onus is on the consumer to suffer consequences and then sue. However, there is a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation in America. The argument is often that strict regulations, like in Europe, stifle innovation. How do we avoid mindlessly bureaucratic legislation while ensuring safety?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the government would just stop stifling the exchange of information, that would reduce the need for legislative power and enforcement. For example, when a drug comes on the market with FDA approval, the FDA should make public all the information the drug company had. Instead, they let the drug company keep secrets as "business secrets" that very often relate to the safety of the product. The FDA tends to conspire to keep information away from the public.

## Caller: Colonoscopy Concerns

**Caller (Pepperwood):** I have reached the age of 60 and everyone tells me I need a colonoscopy, even though I'm not having digestive problems. Is this important, or can I hold off?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My position is pretty extreme. If there is no radiation involved, it's just a matter of the mechanics and the toxic effects of any sedative or anesthetic. I would consider it a potentially justified medical procedure, whereas I would exclude almost always CAT scans and radiation exams.

However, no one really knows the natural history of a polyp because you would have to have a colonoscopy every month for years to watch the development. I suspect that many polyps, the same way that many skin melanomas do, simply fall off and go away without being noticed. In the few areas of the world where almost no one dies of intestinal cancer, colonoscopy is not done. There is a close correlation between doing colonoscopies and having colon cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Also, anybody over the age of 50 will pretty much be found to have some carcinoma somewhere in the body on autopsy, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It has been known since the 1940s. A study published in JAMA showed that all the features used to diagnose cancer in a pathological study can be found in an ordinary healing wound. All of those features—abnormal cell arrangement and structure—can be found in a healing wound.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if they mixed up the slides, they might misdiagnose a healing wound as cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It implies that if you cut it out and study it, you don't know whether it was in the process of healing or not. I think the rational approach is to do what you can that promotes healing rather than doing a biopsy. The areas where they don't get colon cancer are areas of Africa where they eat a high-fiber diet. Milk and fiber are very protective to the colon.

## Closing: The Bystander Effect

**Andrew Murray:** We have to wrap up, but I wanted you to reiterate the rationale behind pigments and skin melanosis—how that cell change can be mitigated with progesterone, given that estrogenic stimulation can be a trigger.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tanning process is probably related to the formation of moles and melanomas. It is a reaction to injury. When cells are being injured—for example, by a progesterone deficiency or stressed by substances like estrogen—the stress reaction creates a pigment as a defense because the pigment is a free radical scavenger.

A famous Israeli researcher, Gershom Zajicek, has reviewed the evidence on melanoma surgery. He says it's very common that when you remove one confirmed melanoma, often new ones will pop up almost immediately. He suggests that the presence of one is sending out signals that suppress the formation of new ones.

**Andrew Murray:** Because there is definitely a bystander effect with cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The bystander effect is a vastly under-investigated subject. It relates to radiation, estrogen, or any kind of injury spreading signals everywhere in the body.
