## Introduction: Economics, Knowledge, and the Biosphere

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. This month’s subject is a mixed topic involving economics, corporate greed, and idealism. We will be weaving in a couple of characters from the mid-1850s who had visionary thoughts about concepts such as the biosphere and noosphere.

We are at a point in time where, as a species, we are definitely becoming more aware of our surroundings. The Internet has made it extremely easy to find information. Sometimes it is erroneous, other times it is revelatory. Unlike in times past, when academia and education were reserved for those with power, influence, and hereditary money, anybody with a desire to know more can get on the Internet and fairly quickly come to an accurate opinion about many things.

However, information can be misleading. In talking with Dr. Peat and looking at research articles—including controlled double-blind studies—we find that even seemingly scientific studies can be misleading. You have to look at the data objectively. If there is money involved, follow the money; that will often reveal the truth.

This month is a medley of things, but with economics and greed at the heart of it. As a species, we are perhaps more relaxed now; there is less physical stress to survive because things are available in convenience stores. We don't have to hunt or grow food. We are becoming less physical and more cerebral. Amazon will deliver to your door.

I want listeners to really think about what I am going to say. It highlights how little most people understand about our economic reality. The largest excuse is, "I'm too busy to get involved." That is true enough; most folks work two or three jobs just to make ends meet. The cost of everything has skyrocketed. Our attention is captivated by working to survive, leaving us less time to organize and steer the government. We are blindsided by the economics of the day and debt.

Dr. Raymond Peat is on the line. He is an open-minded free thinker who has spent most of his life in academia researching subjects that show us a very different way to live.

From an economic perspective, let's look at greed coupled with runaway inflation and the resulting decline in spending power. This fuels the chemically altered world we live in. The struggle to support sustainable and organic foods creates a sense of loss to our environment, both psychologically and physically.

Let's look at the cost of living in real terms from 1950 to the present using three metrics: average family income, average car cost, and median house price.
*   **1950:** Average family income was $3,300. Average car cost was $1,500. Median house price was $7,300.
    *   A car cost roughly half your income.
    *   A house cost just over two times your income.
*   **2014:** Average family income was $51,000. Average car cost was $31,000. Median home price was $188,000.
    *   The home price-to-income ratio jumped to 3.7.

It is no wonder people cannot get on the housing ladder.

## Caller: The Gold Standard and Local Economies

**Caller (San Francisco):** I heard you talking about the standard of living from 1973. That corresponds to when Richard Nixon took us off the gold standard. Have you ever interviewed Frances Moore Lappé? She wrote *Food First: Beyond the Myth of Scarcity*. She describes that when Nixon took us off the gold standard, the rich of the world figured they better invest in tangible things as hedges against inflation. They started buying high-quality land.

For example, starvation in Bangladesh occurred because the super-rich bought agricultural land at the foothills of the Himalayas, driving millions of people off the land. This was specifically tied to removing the US dollar from the gold standard.

Also, regarding Amazon: in the past, kids made money as delivery boys for local stores. Amazon does this on a global scale, meaning kids can't make that side income. Worse, the payment is electronic, sucking money out of the local town immediately to corporate headquarters. It decimates the local economy.

**Andrew Murray:** I was going to get into the point of wages in real terms and the importance of supporting local economies. Local economies are not controlled by central government, and we have much more say in them.

Regarding education: In 1950, annual tuition at the University of Pennsylvania was $600. Current tuition is $40,000 a year. Student loans are fueling this, amounting to about a trillion dollars in debt. According to the Economic Policy Institute, entry-level wages for high school graduates have dropped from $16 an hour in 1973 (adjusted) to $12 an hour now.

Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hello.

**Andrew Murray:** Can you outline your academic background for those who haven't heard you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I did my undergraduate study from 1953 to 1956. I had a summer job where I made $500, and with a tuition scholarship, that paid for my nine months of schooling every year. I looked at prices recently, and it is at least 20 times more expensive now. I couldn't afford to go to school currently.

**Andrew Murray:** You have seen the economics change over the last 80 years. What do you think about the decline in real wages and the increase in costs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of popular culture has to do with keeping people from realizing things are getting worse. For example, you mentioned "average" income. Those figures are usually the *median* income. The actual per capita average income in the US is higher because the vast incomes of the upper 1% or 2% skew the average. Since the gold standard was thrown out, the government has had to keep the illusion going. They are increasingly hiding information; they stopped giving out figures for the money supply a few years ago. The stock market seems to be going up because the government is pumping money into it—basically corruption by printing money.

**Andrew Murray:** This is central banks printing money without penalty.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was the same with Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi; they were trying to get off the petrodollar. Venezuela is doing the same.

## The Biosphere, Carbon Dioxide, and Pollution

**Andrew Murray:** I read in your newsletter about Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin regarding the concepts of the noosphere and the biosphere. We are living in this biosphere and are subject to stresses made known to us through media and debt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vernadsky looked at the planet as a metabolic system. He saw the soil, atmosphere, and solar energy being converted to food and living substance. His concept saw carbon dioxide as a promoter of life, increasing the quality of living.

I see the current fear of carbon dioxide as partly a distraction from actual pollution. Deforestation is a major cause of the CO2 increase, but the deforestation itself is doing the damage, not the CO2. Real pollution is degrading the rivers and oceans—petroleum spills and chemical runoff from mass agriculture.

The propaganda machine—for example, *Politico*—recently published an article claiming rising CO2 would degrade the food supply by stimulating plant growth. The reasoning was completely unbiological and backward. Vernadsky was right: carbon dioxide is part of the soil-forming process. Plants secrete acids to dissolve minerals, but CO2 carried into the soil is part of making minerals available to plants. The mass media promotes myths to confuse the argument and make people worry about a false process.

**Andrew Murray:** It steers people away from looking at real pollution.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even health statistics, like longevity and disease incidence, are being falsified. In the 90s, the government declared it had won the war on cancer. I pointed out then that they were using phony statistics. Around the year 2000, the US Bureau of Statistics changed the rules and stopped giving out raw figures, providing only age-standardized figures to keep up the illusion.

## Caller: Cancer, Chemo, and Shingles

**Caller (Blocksburg):** I called years ago about a lump on my neck. Dr. Peat suggested eating carrots and avoiding CAT scans. It went on for years and ended up being a cancer tumor. I had it removed and went through chemo and radiation.

My question is: a year later, I was cutting a small amount of poison oak. Suddenly, a huge rash went over my shoulder and down around the area where the tumor was. My girlfriend thinks it might be shingles. Could that be related to the radiation and chemo?

**Andrew Murray:** Chemo and radiation lower your resistance, for sure. Shingles can be reactivated chickenpox, especially under stress. Was the cancer metastasizing?

**Caller:** It was a skin-type cancer. It took 12 to 15 years to develop into a massive lump. It wasn't spreading, but it was breaking out of the skin.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what is your take on the rash?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just in case it is actually poison oak: I had an experience in my teens where I was extremely sensitive to poison oak. The word went around camp that Vitamin C protected against it. I took a few tablets, and the poison oak disappeared and I never had it again.

**Caller:** I'm not usually sensitive to poison oak. This turned into huge, blackening bubbles all down one side of my body. It is getting better now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it is a virus like shingles, it is a good idea to have your Vitamin D level checked. Vitamin D is a very powerful antiviral and regulates your immune system. Your serum level should be around 50 nanograms per milliliter.

## Caller: Dental Materials

**Caller (New York):** Does Dr. Peat have advice on finding dentists who use the filling materials he recommends, like calcium oxide for root canals and cements for fillings?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For the root canal, calcium oxide is antiseptic and anesthetic. It is safer than gutta-percha or metal fillings. I think the composite fillings are now high enough in strength that they are good even for chewing teeth.

**Caller:** Do you have advice on finding dentists who use those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For about 50 years, I have had all my dentistry done in Mexico because they emphasize skill and care rather than speed and profit.

## Caller: Defining "Benign" Cancer

**Caller (Phillipsville):** I have a comment regarding the previous caller. You referred to his cancer as "benign" because it hadn't metastasized. That is an oxymoron. There is no such thing as benign cancer. If it is cancer, it is malignant. If it is not cancer, it is a benign tumor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of the language used medically in relation to cancer has been to promote the business of oncologists. Fifty or sixty years ago, cancers were things that were definitely identified as benign. The language was escalated so that something which formerly was not cancer was called "pre-cancer" and then "cancer."

An article in JAMA about 40 years ago looked at pathology methods. It demonstrated that a healing wound, if biopsied, will show all the properties used by pathologists to identify cancer—rapid growth, invasive appearance, etc. The article pointed out that you often can't tell the difference; the only way to know if something is malignant is to wait and see.

**Caller:** Why did you tell the previous caller not to go to a doctor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't remember saying that. I never tell people not to go to doctors, but I tell them to think and question what the doctor tells them to do.

## Caller: Sclerosing Mesenteritis

**Caller (Whitethorn):** First, for the caller looking for a dentist, Dr. James Mattson in Fort Bragg is the best I've ever seen. My question is about sclerosing mesenteritis. Are there herbs that might help dissolve internal scar tissue?

**Andrew Murray:** Dissolving organized scar tissue is difficult. Maybe progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've had experience with fibrotic lumps where Vitamin E helped. I had a vaccination scar that was bulgy; I put Vitamin E on it, and it disappeared in a week. However, a hard lump inside might take six months of anti-inflammatory treatment—Vitamin E, progesterone, and total nutrition improvement.

A lot of sclerosing problems involve abnormal calcification. Hans Selye pioneered the study of how to cause and regress calcified tissue. Vitamin D and high calcium intake help lower your parathyroid hormone, which is part of reversing calcification. Vitamin K is another factor that prevents soft tissue calcification.

## Caller: Graves' Disease and Thyroid

**Caller (Kansas City):** I was diagnosed with Graves' disease, which is supposed to be hyperthyroid, but I've never been hyperthyroid. I had the bulging eyes and swelling in the feet. I am on thyroid hormone, but I still have issues. My antibodies are elevated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a more thorough metabolic study would show something other than just antibodies. You want to check steroid hormones—progesterone, cortisol, Vitamin D—and the actual level of thyroid hormones: T3, T4, and Reverse T3.

**Caller:** I have a new doctor, and we checked all those. Everything is normal, though testosterone was slightly low. My Vitamin D is between 60 and 80.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you tracked your temperature and pulse rate?

**Caller:** My temperature is usually 96.6 to 97 in the morning and goes up to 99 by the end of the day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is not consistent with Graves' disease. I have only seen one person who I think really had hyperthyroid Graves' disease. Many people are diagnosed with it but are actually hypothyroid.

**Caller:** They tell me I have Hashimoto's *and* Graves now. I take T4 in the morning, four hours apart from food.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Did they explain why you should do that? Since it takes a couple of days for things to pass through the intestine, there is plenty of time for T4 to absorb. Your body doesn't want it to absorb all in an hour or two. If the liver perceives a huge, unphysiological surge of T4, it induces enzymes to destroy it. You will actually be hypothyroid 12 hours later.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** I am afraid I have to stop you both there as we are at the end of the show. Thank you, Dr. Peat, for your time.

For those wanting to know more about Dr. Peat, his website is **www.raypeat.com**. He has fully referenced scholarly articles on many subjects. As he mentioned, the government often wants to keep information quiet to keep people manageable.

Thanks for joining us. Until next month, happy fall to you all.
