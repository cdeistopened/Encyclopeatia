## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

We get a lot of positive feedback concerning Dr. Ray Peat on our shows, so he is joining us again tonight. We want to explore misconceptions in medicine and marketing related to serotonin and melatonin, with wider implications for medical drugs in general, as well as carrying on last month's topic on the Fukushima incident. Dr. Peat, please describe your academic professional background for those who perhaps have never listened to you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After I had studied and taught literature and linguistics, I decided that to understand consciousness and language, I should study the brain. But when I started graduate school specializing in nerve biology, I discovered that the brain scientists were just as dogmatic as the linguistic theorists. So I went into general physiology, specializing in reproductive endocrinology. That was one aspect that got me interested in the biological effects of radiation, although I had been interested in the fallout from the nuclear tests for many years. When I saw that the biology of estrogen was very similar to the biology of radiation damage, I tried to understand just what was going on in a cell that caused identical biochemical events to occur, either from a dose of X-rays or a dose of estrogen.

## Update on Fukushima

**Andrew Murray:** To wrap up last month's presentation on the Fukushima dilemma, the power plant is unfortunately still smoldering. It doesn't look like there's going to be any real hope of having it calmed down sufficiently until at least September. The cores themselves are too hot to deal with at this point.

In the initial stages, several websites were revealing information. One was an Austrian website, ZAMG, and another is the EPA RadNet air concentration measurement data. We could see the plume fallout spreading across the Pacific. Sarah, do we want to cover some of those results to date?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've only found one PDF file on the EPA's website that lists reported Uranium-234 in Anaheim and Riverside on March 15th, and then in Seattle and San Francisco on March 18th. I haven't seen an updated file of recent records. It seems that there is iodine being detected in the rainwater and the air all over the country.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I looked at the *Modern Survival Blog*, which covers preparedness. There was a retired nuclear scientist named Arnie Gundersen who stated from the very outset that rather than being a level 5 accident, it was already a 7. In terms of what is potentially happening here, what do you think is some of the best advice people could take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the basic thing is to eat old food—canned or dried food—and avoid fresh vegetables as far as you can. For example, aged cheese is going to be completely safe.

Regarding avoiding iodine damage to the thyroid gland, you can pretty well protect yourself by saturating yourself with iodine from kelp and eating canned oysters and other shellfish. If you paint tincture of iodine on your skin, you absorb quite a bit of it. You can saturate yourself with iodine to protect the thyroid gland during the time that radioactive iodine is still active, which stays harmful for roughly six weeks after its creation. If they are still making new radioactive iodine and emitting it, there's no telling how long that might continue.

**Andrew Murray:** What's your impression of potassium iodide as a supplement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has its own long-range, potentially harmful effects. Even one milligram a day in a chronic diet is known to be associated with thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and probably an increased rate of thyroid cancer. So you don't want to take any thyroid supplement beyond a normal dietary sufficiency, except in the presence of serious radioactive iodine exposure. Considering the risk from the radioactive iodine, I think a few milligrams of potassium iodide per day is a reasonable balance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So a half a teaspoon of kelp powder a couple of times a week, or a couple of milligrams of potassium iodide if you're in an area with radioactive iodine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few people have some strange hypersensitivity to iodine, so you want to test the first dose—a very small amount—because some people get an asthma attack or other violent symptoms.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wanted to mention the beta count on the RadNet data. It's showing that there have been up to 50 counts per minute.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 50 per second is where I would be seriously concerned. 50 per minute wouldn't be bad.

## Serotonin: The "Happy Hormone" Myth

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to the rest of the topic: serotonin, serotonin uptake inhibitors, and melatonin. People generally believe that serotonin is a "feel good" hormone. Dr. Peat, what do you have to say about serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has many responses to injury, and serotonin and estrogen are two of the most basic, primitive responses to any kind of generalized injury. For example, if you get sunburned, in the next few hours you can measure a large amount of serotonin in the urine. That same thing happens for any kind of injury, including ionizing radiation. Dental X-rays are enough to activate the production of serotonin.

It is one of the basic defense mechanisms. What it does is activate simple things like shifting away from oxidative metabolism to glycolytic, or even a kind of hibernating shutdown of systems. At an extreme overproduction of serotonin, you tend to go into a hibernating state. Animals, according to diet, weather, and stress, will produce more and more serotonin before they go into hibernation for the winter. Its basic purpose is to keep the machinery running while shutting down the expensive biological processes.

## Caller: Ocean Currents and Radiation

**Caller:** Does anybody know how long it takes for the ocean currents from Japan to come over to the West Coast? Also, is anybody monitoring the ocean contamination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the currents move something like 80 to 100 miles a day.

**Andrew Murray:** It is about 4,000 to 6,000 miles, so it will take some time.

## Serotonin and Radiation Damage

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and 60s, when the Soviets were worried about hydrogen bombs, they were doing research on ways to defend against very intense radiation doses. Serotonin was one of the things they were studying. They looked for safe analogs to use defensively because a big dose of radiation puts the organism in a state where it can tolerate it—reducing mortality for a given dose by maybe 50%.

Unfortunately, for the kind of dose that we're more likely to be exposed to, serotonin is really what's causing the bulk of the damage. For example, if you give cells in a culture dish the amount of X-ray exposure that you get with a set of dental X-rays, these cells will emit photons—light produced by the cellular damage and excitation—for over an hour after the exposure.

If you put unexposed cells in the water that those cells are in, even without being exposed to radiation, the second batch of cells will begin mutating hours later just from the emissions, such as serotonin, into the water. People have cultured these unexposed cells, exposed only to the chemical products produced by the injured cells, and for 30 generations mutations keep occurring. To form a human being, you only need about 30 multiplications of the original fertilized ovum. So that one small exposure has tremendous repercussions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if our cells are being exposed to a minute amount of radiation, causing them to express more serotonin, what can we do to keep ourselves in a vital state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They found about 40 years ago that high thyroid function, and the magnesium taken up into the cells under the influence of thyroid, was the best way to accelerate the repair process so that you didn't have the lingering mutations from DNA breaks.

There are processes that apply to even the lowest exposure. For example, a study in Seattle found that a full set of dental X-rays to a pregnant woman—even wearing a lead apron—would cause systemic influences resulting in underweight and underdeveloped babies, just as if she had taken an estrogenic substance. Animal studies found that those estrogenic effects could be antagonized by a good dose of progesterone or testosterone, and the usual nutritional things that help the body control estrogen. Estrogen and serotonin happen to be the things that we have the best handle on for protecting ourselves from the long-range effects.

## SSRIs vs. Serotonin Uptake Promoters

**Andrew Murray:** What is your opinion on the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To the extent that they really are acting largely on serotonin, I think it's good to look for alternatives. Much of that is just advertising—the idea that they're a "happy pill" for raising your "happy hormone." Actually, they act on many different processes, increasing adrenaline and dopamine, and activating or inactivating enzymes all through the body.

There are a few very effective antidepressants that are the opposite: they are serotonin uptake *promoters*. They work better.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What are the drug names for those serotonin reuptake promoters?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The best studied is Tianeptine. The brand name is Stabilon. Some people get it over the internet, but it isn't legal in the US. It promotes the uptake of serotonin, so it is less active. It turns out to have lots of beneficial effects on bodily health for arthritis, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions related to overexposure to serotonin.

There is a whole class of anti-serotonin drugs becoming popular for more uses. For example, some are used to prevent nausea or diarrhea from radiation exposure. Ondansetron is the most popular anti-nausea, anti-serotonin drug, but I think one of the best is called Lisuride. All of these are based on the same indole molecular structure that serotonin is, but they are tuned in a different way. For example, Bromocriptine is used to treat pituitary tumors because prolactin is promoted by stress, serotonin, or radiation.

## Melatonin

**Andrew Murray:** How about melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has enzymes activated by stress. For example, in the pineal gland, adrenaline is the signal. Adrenaline rises in the darkness, and it is the immediate activator of the enzyme which converts serotonin into melatonin.

But this same enzyme system can be found in an inflamed breast or a rheumatic knee joint. In these situations of inflammation, melatonin seems to be performing the same function that it does in the brain: a way of eliminating serotonin, which is the actual pro-inflammatory substance. Since serotonin stimulates cell division and inflammation, the presence of this enzyme in the breast is being considered one of the approaches for preventing or treating breast cancer—to accelerate the removal of serotonin.

## Caller: Melatonin Mechanism & High Fructose Corn Syrup

**Caller:** I'm understanding that serotonin is converted by adrenaline into melatonin. Is melatonin available as a supplement to help people relax?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably. Melatonin has a fairly direct anti-serotonin effect. Besides eliminating the serotonin by combining it chemically, I suspect that melatonin is actually a defense, acting as an antagonist against serotonin.

**Caller:** I have another question regarding diabetes. I think a lot of it is related to High Fructose Corn Syrup. I'm curious if the huge influx of SSRIs may also have contributed to the rise in diabetes and obesity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A study at UCLA analyzed the corn syrup sweetener used in soft drinks. They found that it contained the claimed amount of fructose and glucose, but when they hydrolyzed it, they found it contained polysaccharides—starch-like material—containing four to five times the amount of calories that the original sugar had.

**Caller:** If someone was eating those foods and taking an SSRI, that might compound the problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** These polysaccharides, which aren't easily digested by human enzymes, are likely to feed bacteria lower in the intestine. These bacteria produce fermentation products, including lactic acid, which are responsible for causing the intestine to increase its already great production of serotonin and cause it to be absorbed into the circulation. Anxiety, for example, is increased in animals in proportion to the fermentation of these starch-like molecules. So I suspect the starchy materials in the corn sweetener are pretty directly increasing exposure to serotonin.

## Caller: Bee Stings for Inflammation

**Caller:** I keep honeybees and get stung a lot. I've heard it's good to stop inflammation, yet I get inflamed when I get stung. What's going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard that it is the high cortisol production from the pain, as well as the histamine and serotonin from the venom itself, that helps. Serotonin has some very direct actions on the cortisol-producing system. It is maybe analogous to the way surgery can cure things in animal research—the trauma of just being cut can cure whatever they thought the surgery was curing. A very painful bee sting will activate your adrenals to the point that the cortisol can relieve a swollen knee, for example. It is counter-irritation.

## Caller: SSRIs and Receptors

**Caller:** The pharmaceutical industry claims that SSRIs increase the receptors for serotonin, accounting for long-term effects even after the drugs are stopped. Can you comment on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you block a transmitter, the body adaptively increases the so-called receptors. So increasing the exposure to something usually decreases the receptors for that substance in an adaptive process. Everything ends up more or less the way it started.

The whole idea of the receptor is just another invention of the industry to make things simple for television advertising. When you look carefully at the long-range arguments, people for 60 years have been pointing out that the state of the organism and the cell absolutely determines how a given substance is going to affect the cell. It isn't necessarily that you make more of the receptor protein, but that the energy charge of the cell governs what activation of that receptor is going to do. The only way to think of a receptor is that the organism—or the cell—is the receptor.

## Caller: Migraines, Thyroid, and Medications

**Caller:** I'm currently taking Lexapro, Imitrex for migraines, and Synthroid for a thyroid condition. Are the serotonin uptake inhibitors a problem for the thyroid situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are very closely connected. For a long time, it's been clear that hypothyroid people often have extremely high serotonin levels. The active thyroid hormone, T3, will decrease the production and retention of serotonin. Serotonin, being inflammation-promoting and affecting the constriction and leakiness of blood vessels, is a major factor in migraines, which are mostly associated with hypothyroidism.

**Caller:** I also take Cytomel.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cytomel is a good anti-thyroid, anti-serotonin thing. With the right amount of it, it's pretty effective against migraines. My own migraines were largely an interaction between intestinal inflammation—95% of our serotonin is made in the intestine—and low thyroid. Hypothyroidism plus a sensitive intestine will cause periodic flooding of the system with serotonin, which can be measured in migraine attacks.

**Caller:** Is there a problem combining Lexapro, Imitrex, Synthroid, and Cytomel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a blood test for serotonin that I think more people should be checking. It's much more meaningful than the urine tests. The long-range effects of excess serotonin exposure are very similar to the long-range effects of chronic radiation or chronic estrogen exposure. They can produce acute inflammation, but in the long run, you increase your tendency to have fibrosis of various tissues.

## Nutritional Advice & Conclusion

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We have a caller asking about weight gain and migraines with a thyroid condition. Dr. Peat talked about starches, like corn syrup, irritating the intestine and increasing serotonin. One way we can protect ourselves from radiation and the increased serotonin effects of inflammation is to replace our starches—grains, beans, and starchy vegetables—with soft, ripe, juicy fruits. Also, keep thyroid function high with lots of coconut oil, plenty of foods with calcium, local dairy, and plenty of good fruit sugars.

Dr. Peat, did you have any final comments?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think that covers it.
