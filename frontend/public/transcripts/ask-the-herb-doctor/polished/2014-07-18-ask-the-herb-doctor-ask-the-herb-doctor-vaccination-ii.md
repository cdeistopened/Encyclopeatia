## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's Part 2 subject of vaccinations. Safety and efficacy are in question. Once again, I'll be introducing Dr. Raymond Peat to the show. He has some new information regarding facts shown from about 2002 through to now—fairly recent revelations about parts of the vaccination process which are probably more questionable than ever.

I want to open the show by reading what I read last month regarding the "first do no harm" tenet of medicine. The United States legal standard applied to vaccines defines them as "unavoidably unsafe products that are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use." The reason why vaccines are unsafe, or harmful, is because they are made up of chemicals and other elements that are essentially poisonous to the body.

Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. For those who have never listened to this show, would you outline your academic and scientific background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and 60s, I was mostly a student and teacher in the humanities—English literature and painting, for example. Then I decided to go to graduate school in biology and biochemistry at the University of Oregon for a PhD because I had been interested in that for many years, but I considered that the academic approach was pretty futile and misleading.

Since graduating in 1972, I've continued studying, trying to find what I consider the "main line" of science in biology, which is very opposed in many ways to mainstream medical thinking and biology influenced by corporate financing. This main line of biological and chemical thinking I've been following is a more holistic, developmental, time-oriented way of looking at organisms than the reductionist, abstract, molecular approach that has become dominant. That particularly relates to how the immune system works. I did teach a short course in immunology to medical students in Mexico in 1979, but since then, things have radically changed.

## The Decline of Infectious Disease

**Andrew Murray:** I want to start with something that might stun people. My generation, born in the mid-60s, and subsequent generations probably have very little awareness of the fact that all infectious diseases were in free-fall decline *before* the introduction of vaccines. This doesn't enter the consciousness of most people; it is veiled by the fear and mysticism surrounding disease and its apparent cure.

Starting in the 1800s, massive overcrowding, open sewers, poor hygiene, and poor nutrition were largely responsible for the pandemics and epidemics that ravaged Europe. When socio-economic factors improved—general hygiene, nutrition, working hours, and housing—the figures changed.

There is a book by Dr. Suzanne Humphries entitled *Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and The Forgotten History*. Dr. Humphries is a nephrologist who left mainstream medicine after seeing kidney damage initiated by influenza vaccines. She looked at British records from 1750 to the present for about ten infectious diseases, including measles, smallpox, typhoid, whooping cough, diphtheria, polio, syphilis, and malaria. She found a dramatic decrease in the incidence of these diseases mostly around the early 1900s to the end of the Second World War.

Why do you think vaccines have become what they are now in people's minds—that we can't do without them—when in fact diseases were disappearing due to improved health and sanitary conditions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The medical attitude has been developed for more than 100 years. My parents and grandparents were born before the medical indoctrination got underway in the United States and Europe. There were people teaching doctors to vaccinate, but in my parents' generation, they were pretty immune to it. They were forced to be vaccinated in schools, but it was only a later generation—coinciding with the American Medical Association taking over medicine and abolishing natural approaches like naturopathy for about 60 or 70 years—that the drug treatment approach took over.

Several people have recently pointed out that vaccines are really just a cheap way of controlling some infections. It is recognized that good food and a clean environment will prevent infectious diseases, but it is considered too expensive.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you feel about the argument that it is an economic situation? If we had good, clean food—not contaminated with GMOs or laboratory-produced—and people weren't brainwashed into believing butter or sugar are bad for them, there would automatically be an increase in general health. But that isn't in the interest of industries producing products for our ill health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Last month I mentioned the World Health Organization study in Central America. It showed that giving a tiny bit of economic support, such as clean water and a nutritious porridge supplement for pregnant women and children, improved the health of the study village relative to one that had no intervention. The village that had the intervention with doctors, vaccines, and standard medicine saw health go *down* during the study period. That actually said medicine is bad for you.

Even the cleaning up of the environment led by the Rockefeller Foundation—trying to prevent hookworm infection and improving nutrition in schools—was done because it was realized that sick, undernourished, mentally undeveloped people didn't make good workers. So, cleaning up the environment and feeding people is good for the corporate economy too. But it happens that it's even cheaper to use vaccines, and more profitable. Even if the environment got clean enough and people were well fed, it would still be very profitable to sell the chemical and vaccination approach.

**Andrew Murray:** I have a friend who noted that the regular acellular pertussis vaccination has actually increased *Bordetella parapertussis* colonization in children. She suggests that many children with unknown fevers and unwellness, but without the typical cough, actually have *Bordetella parapertussis* colonization resulting from the vaccination itself. Have you heard anything about this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not at all.

## The Immune System: Innate vs. Adaptive

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss the vaccine theory. We are a stream of consciousness constantly evolving and affected by our environment. In terms of immunity, would you describe the basic immune system—the innate versus the adaptive—and then how vaccines and adjuvants like aluminum affect this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Currently, the medical community emphasizes the difference between the **innate immune system**, which they view as the first barrier to infection, and the **adaptive system**, which learns to be specifically immune to invading organisms.

The 1908 Nobel Prize was divided between two proponents of theories of immunity: Paul Ehrlich and Élie Metchnikoff.
*   **Metchnikoff** was an embryologist who emphasized the role of phagocytes in destroying or isolating invading material and reconstituting a healthy organism.
*   **Ehrlich** was interested in the staining properties of cells. He showed that chemicals which could stain organisms specifically could also react with equal specificity to pathogens. The idea of a "magic bullet" came from his approach—mercury, arsenic, and later sulfa drugs.

Ehrlich's context dominated thinking about adaptive immunity and how specificity could be evoked by vaccines. Meanwhile, the developmental innate resistance Metchnikoff talked about was ignored until Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger revived the idea in the 90s around the **Danger Theory**. This was analogous to when Metchnikoff stuck a splinter into a jellyfish and showed it was engulfed by phagocytes—wandering cells that could eat invading material and turn it to nutritious use.

This was a complete rethinking of the specific chemical orientation of adaptive immunity. Since the 1990s, the Danger Theory has been incorporated into the mainstream, but they limit it to thinking of the innate system as a barrier and an amplifier of inflammation, which simply shifts over to making the adaptive system run faster. They've accepted innate immunity but in a subordinate way.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you feel about the introduction of fragments of proteins or RNA to the adaptive system? This supposedly underpins vaccine science—that the body prepares memory T-cells to jump in as soon as they contact the organism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By trial and error, it has been known for generations that "junk" added to an antigen makes it produce more active antibodies. Following that accidental learning, it was found that alum—an aluminum compound—is a good kind of junk to make the peptide or protein adhere and be more effective at forming antibodies.

One theory was that the aluminum condensed the protein into a little ball the immune system could deal with. But in the last five or ten years, the tendency is to see aluminum as an activator of the innate inflammatory process. There is a growing awareness that the adjuvant is there for the purpose of creating a generalized inflammation.

This is where the long-range view of "doing no harm" is being neglected. The embryological approach sees that what happens early in development will have permanent, lifelong effects. If you introduce an inflammatory state early in life, you have to wait 20, 30, or 40 years to see the effects. That hasn't been done.

With the new emphasis on the innate immune system as an inflammation amplifier, it is recognized that throughout our skin and mucous membranes, there are **dendritic cells**. These are the major antigen-presenting cells. In normal exposure to germs, the dendritic cells capture the antigen and present them to thymus cells, which instruct the production of antibodies. But this only works if the antigen is broken down and attached to the organism's own surface compatibility factors.

**Andrew Murray:** The MHCs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It is the combination of the invading peptides with the organism's own normal cell surface that immunity is developed toward. In the extreme form of the Danger Theory, this is the essence of the immune system: it is there to restore and maintain the structure of the organism, not primarily to attack invaders.

## Caller Questions: Supplements and Digestion

**Caller:** What are your thoughts on L-glutamine? I've read about people using it to heal stomach ulcers and restore intestinal integrity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it should be limited to what is available in the proteins of the diet. When an amino acid is manufactured in a pure chemical form, it always has risky contaminants not present in the whole natural protein. Secondly, while people talk about the glucose dependency of cancer cells, glutamine is actually a favorite food for promoting cancer cell growth. An excess of any single amino acid can be harmful, including overloading you with ammonia. If you had a clean source, it would be beneficial in some cases, but I think it's risky.

**Caller:** What is the upper limit for glycine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few grams per day, divided into doses of half to one gram at a time, would be safe.

**Caller:** You've mentioned activated charcoal to clean up the intestine if carrots and bamboo shoots weren't doing the job. How would you use it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, ensure it is clean and hasn't been exposed to environmental contaminants, because it captures things from the air. If you have a clean source, you can add it to a drink or food.

**Caller:** Is a tablespoon at a time the dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, depending on what you're using it for.

## Caller Questions: Skin Issues

**Caller:** My question is about skin tags. What is the underlying cause, and is there anything topical to get rid of them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know the underlying cause, but they become very common as a person approaches middle age (40 or 45). That suggests a deficiency of the protective, stabilizing hormones. Since the skin is a major hormone-synthesizing organ, making sure you have enough cholesterol and thyroid in your diet to make protective steroids would be helpful. Some people have used topical DHEA or progesterone dissolved in oil, or micro-pulverized pregnenolone on the skin. Sometimes that will clear up a variety of growths, including skin tags.

**Caller:** How do you feel about turmeric or ginger to reduce inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people are allergic to those. Even though the research looks good, especially for turmeric, you want to be careful with herbal things because they have many other components which can trigger strong allergic reactions.

## Caller Questions: Memory, Focus, and ADHD

**Caller (Ed):** I'm hoping Dr. Peat can speak to poor memory, focus, low energy, and ADHD.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having an adequate amount of protein is an essential first step. For an average-sized person, around 100 grams of good protein per day optimizes mental functioning. A Pentagon study of pilots found a high-fat diet was best for attention and avoiding accidents.

Vitamin B1 is used to produce energy from glucose. If you are deficient, a supplement of 10mg or more can be spectacular for mental focus and clarity.

If it isn't a nutritional problem, it is often low temperature of the brain. If your brain is only 94 or 95 degrees Fahrenheit, it won't function well. Studies showed that heating the head raised memory, quickness, and clarity of reasoning.

**Caller (Ed):** How would one know if their brain is at an optimum temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eardrum thermometers are the closest immediate way to judge brain temperature.

**Caller (Ed):** Would wearing a beanie help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it can help. People with low body temperature often have insomnia due to the stress it causes; they sleep better with warm socks and a warm cap. Dietarily, things that keep your brain temperature up include protein, salt, sugar, and the steroids pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone.

**Caller (Ed):** Regarding protein, what would 100 grams equate to in food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Three quarts of milk would provide just about the right amount. Or 15 eggs. Or a combination of a quart and a half of milk, a few eggs, and some cheese. You can't depend on the protein in nuts and beans because their digestibility and quality aren't equal to animal proteins.

## Caller Questions: Galangal

**Caller:** Is galanga and galangal the same thing? It looks like ginger. I heard it's used for skin cancers. Do you know anything about growing it or its medicinal uses?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes, galangal is a member of the ginger family. It's an Ayurvedic herb. It requires a tropical environment, so you wouldn't have success growing it in Crescent City without a hot house. I've never used it medicinally, though I've used lots of ginger.

## Caller Questions: Arginine, Vitamin D, and Sugar

**Caller:** I've heard L-arginine is good for you. Can you tell me what it does?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the precursor to two important substances: creatine phosphate (energy reserve) and nitric oxide. Very often, if you supplement arginine, you boost nitric oxide, which turns *off* your ability to produce energy. I think it's fairly predictably a risk.

**Caller:** Is 5,000 units of Vitamin D3 a day a proper dose? The bottle says every other day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is currently believed to be correct for the average person in the north. I've never heard of it being too much. Many people take it daily. The officially recommended few hundred units is definitely inadequate.

**Andrew Murray:** Reference limits have increased recently. Most people are low and don't reach therapeutically recognized levels. 5,000 units would not seem excessive.

**Caller:** You say sugar is good for you, but do you mean fruit? I heard too much sugar overacts insulin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Generally, getting your sugar from fruit is best because of the minerals and nutrients. Occasionally, if the rest of your diet is good, refined sugar can be helpful. Honey provides basically the same as refined sugar with a few extra helpful chemicals. I recommend refined sugar only for specific therapeutic uses.

## Innate Immunity as a Repair System

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I want to return to the innate immune system. The medical world sees it as a source of inflammation, a barrier, and a switch for the adaptive system. However, I think the inflammatory function is, to some extent, a *malfunction* of the innate immune system.

When irritation or damage is not repaired quickly enough, you see noticeable inflammation. I think the innate system is really a repair system. The signals it sends out are calling in repair cells. Its ideal function shouldn't reach the stage of inflammation and shouldn't activate the adaptive system strongly.

Thinking of the organism in a long-range, lifelong pattern, you don't want to overburden and misdirect the system by causing repeated inflammation. An example of why I think it is not primarily a system of producing inflammation is that **pregnenolone** has been discovered to turn *off* the immune cells activated by injury or pathogens. The cells should produce their reaction, call in repair processes, and then switch over to producing pregnenolone to stabilize cells and stop the inflammation.

## Caller Questions: Ketosis

**Caller:** I was curious about the ketosis concept—eating mostly fat and no grains or sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it activates the stress system if you have to produce the ketones yourself. If you have precursors in your diet that are partly formed ketones, those are great and equivalent to sugar. But if you have to turn on the process of making them, it means you aren't getting enough glucose or fruit.

**Caller:** Everywhere I look says the opposite.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You turn on cortisol production when you don't have enough sugar. Cortisol has chronic, harmful developmental effects. You need sugar from fruit, honey, or milk.
