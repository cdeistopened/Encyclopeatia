## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herbal extracts.

This month we are very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat back to the show. We will be examining some common misconceptions surrounding thyroid treatment and the apparently normal thyroid test in clients with obvious manifestations of thyroid imbalance. We have seen remarkable progress made with clients whose symptoms improve dramatically with diet and lifestyle changes that promote thyroid health, revealing a prior lowered thyroid function even in the absence of diagnostic tests that show obvious problems. Welcome again, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat has over 40 years of experience in lecturing, teaching, writing, editing, and nutritional counseling. He has a PhD in biology, but his work was all in physiology and biochemistry. We wanted to talk about thyroid disease because it seems to be a chronic epidemic. Dr. Peat, what would you describe low thyroid disease, or hypothyroidism, to be?

## Defining Hypothyroidism and Metabolism

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a slowing of the oxidative metabolism, which means your biological efficiency falls drastically. We rely almost entirely on oxidative metabolism. In emergencies, we can use glycolytic, non-oxidative metabolism, but then we have to make up for it by re-oxidizing the lactic acid that was produced during the oxygen deprivation or energy stress. Everything that is human, mammalian, or even a complex organism depends on the thyroid because all cellular activity requires oxidative metabolism to be efficient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the thyroid is controlling the oxygen to all the cells in our system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. One of the effects is that our carbon dioxide production is kept at a fairly high rate in relation to oxygen consumption, and that keeps our tendency to produce lactic acid very low. If a person is low thyroid, even at rest, they can seem metabolically as if they are doing stressful activity. They can chronically have elevated lactic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why people experience chronic fatigue? Are their muscles fatigued even though they aren't doing exercises that seem to use their muscles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because when you don't use oxygen efficiently, you have to make lactic acid to keep the cells alive. The lactic acid then has to be re-oxidized in your liver to turn it eventually to carbon dioxide. Just sitting passively for a hypothyroid person can be the same as running at high speed for a healthy person.

## Diagnosing Hypothyroidism: The Achilles Reflex vs. Blood Tests

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 60 years ago, it was well known that a hypothyroid person has trouble relaxing their muscles and nerves. There were publications showing that you can invariably diagnose hypothyroidism with a simple thump of the ankle tendon to the gastrocnemius muscle (the calf muscle). When you are kneeling and you thump that, you can see that the relaxation is delayed. That was established as a good diagnostic method in the 1930s and 40s. However, the labs and pharmaceutical companies couldn't sell anything. You can use a table knife or a wooden hammer handle to thump the tendon, and it takes about two minutes. It is a very uneconomical business for doctors in the pharmaceutical industry to diagnose the condition so simply.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why the blood test came about? The TSH, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For the first 20 years or so, doctors were told not to use the Achilles relaxation test, the basal metabolic oxygen consumption test, or any of the proven absolute confirmations of hypothyroidism because they had what they called the "scientific blood test" to prove it. That was called the Protein Bound Iodine (PBI) test. That convinced doctors all over the country that, where previously 40% of the population had shown evidence of being hypothyroid, the new blood test showed that only 5% were. For 20 years this test was used, convincing the medical world that very few people are seriously hypothyroid. Then, in the 1960s, it turned out that protein bound iodine has essentially nothing to do with thyroid hormone functioning.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about the TSH used today? Do you think that is relevant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the PBI test was thrown out, they looked for other tests—which conveniently proved to be even more expensive—and finally settled on the TSH test. They can measure it very precisely, but it isn't clear what it means in many cases because things other than the absence or excess of thyroid hormone can raise or lower it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So someone can have varying levels of TSH, which doctors say is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, but it doesn't really relate specifically to thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's true. It also has bad side effects; it promotes inflammation in itself. Low thyroid people not only lack metabolic energy, but they tend to have very high TSH levels, and the TSH is causing chronic tissue damage.

## Dietary Causes: Cabbage Family and Polyunsaturated Fats

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you think is causing low thyroid function in so many people in the U.S. today?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 70 years ago, it sometimes included an iodine deficiency, but with the iodination of table salt, other factors became far more important. Many times it is a protein deficiency or an excess of eating certain foods that inhibit the thyroid, such as raw cabbage, or an excess of any of the cabbage family foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That would include kale, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, mustard, and watercress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, even if they are cooked, if you eat a huge amount of them, that can be enough to make you hypothyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this to do with the sulfur groups?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a combination of a carbon that contains an oxygen or nitrogen and a sulfur group. These are known medical chemicals used specifically to inhibit the thyroid to treat hyperthyroidism.

**Andrew Murray:** In previous interviews, you have brought out polyunsaturated oils as being antagonists to thyroid function and downright thyroid destructive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They antagonize the thyroid function at several levels. For example, they inhibit the proteolytic enzymes in the gland itself which are needed to form and secrete the hormone. They bind to the protein in the bloodstream that transports thyroid, preventing transport to the tissues. Finally, the polyunsaturated fats block several of the active sites in the cell where thyroid should bind to enliven the cell.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they affect thyroid health at the production location, the transportation through the bloodstream, and at the tissue level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They also act on several other parts of the system, including indirectly on the TSH.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** These polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in vegetable oils like corn, soy, sesame, safflower, canola (rapeseed), and fish, hemp, and flaxseed oils.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is also one which isn't a fatty acid, but is a highly unsaturated molecule: carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. It not only blocks the cellular sites that use vitamin A, but as a polyunsaturated molecule, it blocks the thyroid function everywhere that the vegetable oils do.

**Andrew Murray:** So this would be ingesting lots of cooked carrots, pumpkin, or anything with high levels of carotene?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some studies confused people because they knew vitamin A was protective against cancer, but they saw that some types of cancer increased with supplementation of carotene. Carotene blocks the receptor so your body can't use the vitamin A. Vitamin A and thyroid work so closely together biologically that the protein transporting them is a single protein called transthyretin (retinol-thyroid transport). In the 1930s, one way of confirming a person had died from hypothyroidism was that the steroid-forming tissues turned red because of accumulated carotene. You can't use vitamin A if you don't have thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this the reason behind people having yellow calluses on their soles or palms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that is one of the old ways to diagnose hypothyroidism.

## Symptoms: Skin, Energy, and Blood Pressure

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I want to mention some symptoms and signs that accompany the disease.

**Andrew Murray:** The list is exhaustive: less stamina, long recovery periods after activity, inability to fight infection, cold hands and feet, high or rising cholesterol, dry hair, hair loss, and dry cracking skin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Contrary to dry skin, you can also have acne on the face, shoulders, chest, and back. Dr. Peat, why would both dry skin and acne be symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Partly it is the close connection between vitamin A and thyroid. The skin needs vitamin A to differentiate properly. Mucous membranes require vitamin A too; in an extreme deficiency, the surface of the eye becomes scaly like snakeskin. The lack of both thyroid and vitamin A can cause skin problems including plugging the pores—allowing infection to set in because the thyroid doesn't allow immune cells to function properly—and thinning of the skin because it isn't growing fast enough.

Estrogen is contrary to vitamin A's effect. Progesterone and vitamin A are closely connected. When you have enough vitamin A and thyroid, your skin can produce progesterone and other steroids. When they are lacking, estrogen takes effect and tends to prematurely harden, or keratinize, the skin cells. The juicy cell collapses and becomes a bit of leathery scale material. That is accelerated by estrogen and retarded by thyroid, vitamin A, and progesterone.

**Andrew Murray:** Other symptoms include exhaustion, lack of motivation, broken fingernails, tinnitus, joint pain, fluid retention, and blood pressure problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many doctors are confused about blood pressure. Hypothyroidism typically increases the viscosity of the blood and raises blood pressure. A slightly hypothyroid person might have low blood pressure, but a high percentage of people with hypertension are simply hypothyroid. Correcting it with a supplement of thyroid will lower the blood pressure.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is contrary to what we were taught in medical school. We were taught high blood pressure is a sign of high thyroid function.

**Andrew Murray:** You would think thyroid is a stimulating hormone, but actually, it improves sleep, calms you down, and lowers resting pulse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen two people who chronically had a pulse around 180 beats per minute. One had it for 20 years. Within a couple of weeks of taking thyroid, both had it down to a normal 90 or 100 beats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you consider a healthy, normal thyroid pulse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies of different ages. High school kids who were healthy and had the best grades had a resting pulse averaging 85 beats per minute. When old people on heart pacemakers were given mental exams with the pacemaker set at the usual 70 beats, they had the usual old person's memory. When they cranked the pacemaker up to 85, every mental function improved.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is interesting because we are taught that a racing pulse diagnoses hyperthyroidism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is an old doctrine from the beginning of the 20th century called the "Rate of Living Theory"—that the faster your heart beat, the sooner you would die. The experiment that "proved" it involved putting cantaloupe seeds in a saucer of water. The ones that sprouted soonest and grew fastest died soonest. But they didn't put any soil in the dish, so they simply used up all their food. It is an embarrassment for science.

## Caller: Long-Term Hypothyroidism and Recovery

**Caller 1:** If a person was quite low in thyroid for more than 20 years, what kind of damage could that cause? Also, once taking supplementation, when could you expect to be better? I've been getting supplements for 20 years and am still incapacitated. I don't have a thyroid; it was removed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually doctors prescribe thyroxine (T4). That isn't the thyroid hormone; it has to be turned into the active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), in the liver. When a doctor prescribes thyroxine, there is no chance you will be overdosed because as you increase it, it can sometimes suppress function. One patient with myxedema coma had been given increasing doses of Synthroid (T4) up to 500 micrograms and went into a coma. In the hospital, they gave her an injection of the active hormone T3, and she came out of the coma in a few hours.

You can have an amazing recovery from many things in a matter of minutes. For example, a doctor with agonizing breast pain took a 10 microgram tablet of Cytomel (T3). In 10 minutes, the pain stopped.

**Caller 1:** I have taken both. Is the damage from 20 years without a thyroid irreparable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some types of damage, such as osteoporosis, take time. When your thyroid is low, your pituitary tends to swell and overproduce prolactin. Prolactin causes breast pain and is a major factor in bone loss. It can take a long time of correcting your diet along with thyroid to restore bones, but I have seen people increase bone density by 20% in less than a year. Even lifelong things can be corrected quickly. I grew an inch and a half in my 40s when I started taking thyroid.

## Caller: Thyroid Storm, Adrenals, and Stress

**Caller 2:** I had thyrotoxicosis and went into a thyroid storm. I was treated with Iodine-131 and have been taking Synthroid for 30 years. Can you explain the connection between the adrenal, the pituitary, and the thyroid? How bad is stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your thyroid is low, you don't have efficiency with oxidative metabolism, so you turn sugar into lactic acid. Your liver spends energy converting lactic acid back to sugar, so low blood sugar is a constant problem.

To compensate, your adrenal medulla secretes adrenaline to force your liver to release stored sugar. When that isn't enough, the adrenal cortex secretes cortisol to break down protein (muscle tissue) to make sugar. Falling blood sugar and rising adrenaline signal the brain to increase stress hormones like ACTH and prolactin. ACTH drives cortisol up, and cortisol causes acute tissue damage, loss of muscle mass, and bone loss.

**Andrew Murray:** And weight gain, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. As your ability to burn fat decreases with falling thyroid, cortisol eats up the skeletal muscles that burn fat. The unburned fat gets laid down in the trunk, neck, and face.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when doctors diagnose "adrenal fatigue," they really need to look at thyroid function, vitamin A, and cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Many people diagnosed with Addison's disease simply had thyroid so low they couldn't produce steroids. You need cholesterol and thyroid to make steroids like progesterone, pregnenolone, and cortisol.

## Temperature as a Diagnostic Tool

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How is temperature affected by low thyroid? What should a waking morning temperature be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oral temperature should be around 98 degrees.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And after eating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It should quickly pop up to 98.6 or 98.8. As they get muscle activity going during the day, it can rise to 99 degrees in the afternoon.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Most clients I see have much lower temperatures. If they have low thyroid symptoms in conjunction with low temperatures, is that a diagnosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you look at the whole picture—Achilles reflex, symptoms, calorie burning, sleep quality, and the ability to relax instantly after exertion—all of those go with the good temperature curve.

## Caller: Hashimoto's and Naltrexone

**Caller 3 (Kevin):** I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease. Can Dr. Peat speak about that and the use of Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hashimoto's was originally defined as infiltration of white blood cells into the inflamed thyroid gland. Since they don't like to cut out a piece of the gland to confirm that, they look for antibodies in the blood. However, anti-thyroid antibodies overlap with many other problems, including arthritis, so they aren't strictly diagnostic. They do indicate inflammation. Since the thyroid is the basic anti-inflammatory hormone, often the thyroid is the main problem. Studies show that supplementing with thyroxine can decrease antibodies.

Regarding Naltrexone: When you are hypothyroid and produce lactic acid, you accumulate endorphins. Endorphins limit physiological functions in a protective way, like hibernation. Naltrexone clears those out. Sometimes in two or three days, a person can come out of depression or a lethargic state.

**Caller 3:** Is there any problem with long-term use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but I usually see good results in just two or three days. I think the basic treatment is a good diet and thyroid supplement. Naltrexone is good to try to break up a pattern.

## Caller: Fish Oil and Cod Liver Oil

**Caller 4 (Mike):** Earlier you listed vegetables and oils that affect the thyroid. Would cod liver oil be placed in with those oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fish oils are long molecules compared to seed oils. They don't inhibit our enzymes for metabolizing fats as seriously as seed oils (like canola or corn) do. However, they are very unstable to oxidative breakdown. By the time they get in the blood, they are often oxidized.

Studies show fish oils have an anti-inflammatory effect, but only their oxidative breakdown products—which include toxins like acrolein—are the active anti-inflammatory substances. They suppress immunity. Temporarily it alleviates symptoms, but in the long run, it poisons the immune system. There are articles showing fish oils contribute to atherosclerosis, increase metastatic cancer risk, and are toxic to the brain.

## Caller: Synthetic vs. Natural Thyroid

**Caller 5 (Jenny):** I've been on Armour Thyroid. My doctors want to switch me to a synthetic. Are there disadvantages? Also, do synthetics contain milk products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The company that makes Armour also makes a synthetic called Thyrolar, based on the original Armour product. The FDA has required formula changes in natural thyroid, so quality varies. Thyrolar is a synthetic chemical that has been steady for 40 or 50 years and is equivalent to traditional Armour. You can check the manufacturer (Forest Pharmaceuticals) regarding milk content. Other similar products available from Mexico are Novothyral and Cynoplus.

## Caller: Staph Infections

**Caller 6:** I have been diagnosed with staph infections—multiple lesions resembling boils all over my body. My husband caught it too. How do I treat this?

**Andrew Murray:** One product is an allicin-rich garlic extract, used successfully for internal staph. However, Dr. Peat might note the sulfur content.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen chronic infections clear up with just thyroid or thyroid and nutrition. It is good to cover the bases. Tetracycline, for example, has a structure parallel to vitamin K and the active ingredient of aloe and cascara. Those molecules have a beneficial effect on the immune system as well as being slightly suppressive to bacteria.

I had a friend whose doctors wanted to amputate his legs because of gangrene and bone infection. I made him take thyroid. Within two weeks, the sores closed. When his doctor made him stop the thyroid, the infection returned. He cycled through this three times—feet rotting without thyroid, clearing up with thyroid.
