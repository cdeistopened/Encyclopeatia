## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Hi and good evening to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

Tonight, we are discussing the use of urea in the treatment of various pathologies. We're also going to get into a recapitulation regarding isoflavones, soy products, and things that are touted as being healthful but lack scientific backing—such as fish oil. Joining us is Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat, would you discuss your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Academically, I studied various things for an MA in humanities. From 1968 to 1972, I got a PhD in biology specializing in reproductive physiology and the biochemistry related to it. I've been talking to lots of people about biological ideas for about 50 years, so my education comes in a lot of non-academic ways.

## Urea and Cancer Treatment

**Andrew Murray:** We discussed the treatment of cancer with urea recently, specifically referencing Dr. Evangelos Danopoulos, a Greek medical doctor. He published peer-reviewed papers in journals like *The Lancet* and *Clinical Oncology* in the late 70s and early 80s. What are your interpretations of the mechanism by which urea affects this anti-cancer activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think one of the essential things is that it inhibits nitric oxide formation. Nitric oxide formation is probably the main means by which stress of any kind can turn off oxidative energy production. Anything that will turn off nitric oxide excess will restore energy production.

Restoring energy production has structural ramifications. The constant consumption of oxygen maintains and renews the microscopic structure of a cell. About 50 years ago, people argued that the membrane is semi-permeable and has pumps run by cell energy. In fact, there are no demonstrated pumps, and the pumps they postulated would take many times more energy than a cell could ever produce.

The cell is doing something very different from maintaining osmotic balance; it is maintaining the structure in an atomically fine sense—right down to the electronic relations of atoms to each other. Urea participates in this directly as well as helping to prevent the loss of the oxidative production of energy.

**Andrew Murray:** How does the concentration of urea play a role?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The normal amount in the blood is just a few milligrams per hundred cc's of blood. But you can increase that to 1,000 milligrams—almost 1% of the blood—without disturbing things physiologically. Danopoulos found that when he got the blood level up to at least 85mg percent—more than 10 times the normal amount—the cancers would start disappearing.

Even before that concentration, it shuts down the production and action of nitric oxide. It fits right into the way water is structured and increases the ability of the cell's natural hormones to structure the water and protein system the way the cell wants to. Urea supports what the cell wants to do.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this similar to the concept of "structured water"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is exactly what the oxidative system is doing to the electrons. It is preventing an excess of electrons. Toxins, carcinogens, and radiation do the opposite: they put too many loose electrons into the wrong places.

The chemical system of the proteins contains a lot of sulfhydryl compounds, like glutathione. This is a sulfur compound maintained by energy-rich fuel molecules. It maintains a certain degree of oxidation in balance with sulfhydryl groups attached to the proteins. The proteins are like a reservoir of electrons at the right energy level. Oxygen metabolism, besides providing ATP, prevents an overflow of loose electrons getting into the structure of the proteins. Too many electrons will de-differentiate the cell, moving it towards non-oxidative energy production and the formation of lactic acid.

## Wound Healing and Scarring

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Danopoulos worked with liver cancers, but also ocular cancers—melanomas and basal cell carcinomas.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** His articles on that have photographs that show very vividly the elimination of the cancer and restoration of normal tissue. One of the interesting things about urea is that at these very high concentrations, it is so stabilizing to normal tissue that it prevents the formation of deforming scars.

In a 1935 publication, someone described its use in treating wounds of all kinds. Packing crystals right into the wound or ulcer would clear up the infection and stimulate healing, but it would heal without visible scarring.

**Andrew Murray:** I read that it promoted rapid granulation tissue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a story about an African spiny mouse that can regenerate its tissue very quickly. Punching a hole in the skin, it could close the wound by almost two-thirds in the first day. In three or four days, the wound would be healed without a scar.

**Andrew Murray:** Young children heal rapidly compared to older people. That has to be down to an electronic energy state, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The oxidative metabolism slows down from early embryonic development down to old age.

**Andrew Murray:** How can people stave off that electronic degradation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the uterus, the developing embryo heals without scarring. I think two factors are involved: the high carbon dioxide level and the higher urea-related compounds in the amniotic fluid. In the adult, pure carbon dioxide gas can be blown into an ulcer to stimulate healing and reduce pain.

As soon as an organism is born, it starts interacting with the outside environment. In the uterus, it was getting energy filtered through the placenta and making its own fats out of glucose and fructose. The organism using carbohydrate for energy produces saturated fats or omega-9 unsaturated fats. When we come into the world, we are exposed to fats produced by organisms living at a lower temperature. The colder a plant is exposed to, the more unsaturated its fats are. Those interrupt our oxidative metabolism to the extent that we become saturated with them.

## Dosage and Mushrooms

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding dosage, Danopoulos used 15 grams of urea in a quart of water to be drunk daily. For skin tumors, he used injections of 15% to 50% urea solution. He quoted blood urea levels of 75-85mg percent. What does that equate to in intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That requires taking quite a bit more than 15 grams per day. Some studies used up to 120 grams per day divided into doses of about 15 grams. In the 1950s, it was the main treatment for reducing brain edema. Urea isn't osmotically active because it goes right into the cells; it soothes the cell's excitation, changes its electronic balance, and lets the cell give up the water it doesn't need—very much the way progesterone and thyroid work.

**Andrew Murray:** Another study mentioned that common white and brown mushrooms inhibit aromatase. They found 10 grams of cooked mushrooms a day reduced breast cancer by 64%. With the addition of green tea, it was an 89% reduction.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You would think there would be more news about that.

## Caller: Urine Therapy and Evolution

**Caller (David):** Indigenous people used urine for medicinal purposes. Did they intuitively know about the urea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known quite a few people who did it regularly and seemed extremely healthy. The Chinese used it, and one interpretation was that it concentrated metabolites of progesterone and pregnenolone. They used these to extend the lives of the wealthy.

**Caller (David):** If we work backward on physiology, it appears humanity evolved in equatorial, high-altitude areas. This implies we should be eating more saturated fats found in warm climates. If someone studied this, would they find that moving away from the equator causes problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is my orientation on origins: high altitude, warm climate, lots of fruit. All foods would be more saturated in a more equatorial environment.

**Caller (David):** Are scientists oblivious to this? They aren't warning us about polyunsaturated fats or lack of sunlight.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I ran across publications in food journals 40 or 50 years ago showing that fats vary with the climate and have a definite function. Some function to protect plants against animal predators by poisoning them. It was recognized 40 years ago that seed oils are a biological defense.

## Caller: Fish Oil vs. Saturated Fat

**Caller:** I've taken fish oil, but I'm hearing it has negative effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The majority of the oils we store are unsaturated, but our cells prefer to oxidize saturated fats. With aging, our tissues load up on unsaturated fats. In N-3 fats (omega-3), the double bonds are farther from the acidic end, making them more unstable in the presence of oxygen.

When we are stressed, our bloodstream gets a high concentration of N-6 fatty acids, which produce toxic prostaglandins that cause inflammation. If you take fish oil, these oxidize quickly and interfere with the formation of prostaglandins. You get temporary relief from inflammation because you are suppressing the immune system. In the long run, that does damage because it is so highly oxidizable. In some experiments, N-3 fats increased the metastatic spread of cancer cells.

**Caller:** What would you recommend for healthy brain function instead?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Saturated fats are protective, stabilizing cell membranes and being cardiovascularly protective. Coconut oil, palm oil, butter, and animal fat.

**Andrew Murray:** Note that animal fat needs to be organic, or you risk pesticide and hormone residues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It also depends on what the animals were fed. Chickens are highly polyunsaturated. Pork for the last 50 years has been full of polyunsaturated fats. Even lard is often treated as a saturated fat in studies, but it can have 35% PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), making it risky.

## Caller: Breast Health and Fibroids

**Caller:** Can you address urea in reference to breast health and fibroids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know of specific treatments for those with urea. However, the amino acid arginine can either form nitric oxide or urea. Irritants and toxins tend to shift it away from forming urea toward nitric oxide. Avoiding polyunsaturated fats helps you maintain the proper amount of urea formation.

**Andrew Murray:** Estrogen is likely one of the main contributory factors for fibroids.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. Low thyroid causes the ratio of estrogen to progesterone to be very high. Endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and breast fibrocystic disease all go with high estrogen, low progesterone, and low thyroid function.

## Caller: Insomnia and High Blood Pressure

**Caller:** I have insomnia. I take three blood pressure pills. I heard tart cherry juice helps.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Checking for thyroid function is important. Blood sugar is always a problem at night. Daylight maintains efficient oxidative metabolism; just 15 minutes of darkness is enough to lower the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration.

Having a carbohydrate meal late in the afternoon or before bed—like a glass of orange juice or milk with honey—helps. Sometimes the dose of sugar puts you to sleep for only an hour or two, so it's good to have another glass ready for when you wake up. Salty snacks at bedtime, like milk with salty tortilla chips or pork rinds, help stabilize blood sugar and energy production.

**Caller:** Is that safe with high blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin K is a very important nutrient for regulating blood sugar, blood calcium, and blood pressure. I've known people who lowered their systolic pressure by 100 points in a week or two using Vitamin K. If you are already at normal blood pressure, be cautious. 5 or 10 milligrams is a pretty safe dose.

Vitamin D is also essential. If you aren't getting sunlight, get a blood test. You want the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol test. Both Vitamin K and D prevent excitatory excess.

## Caller: Urea Popularity, MSM, and Nuts

**Caller:** If urea is so good for cancer, why is it not a more popular treatment?

**Andrew Murray:** It's likely because it's simple and cheap. It doesn't make money like the pharmaceutical industry requires.

**Caller:** What about MSM and Glucosamine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Be very cautious. Glucosamine is suspected of being a factor in creating diabetes if taken too long. MSM can be toxic in itself. Cells definitely don't need it.

**Caller:** Is fish oil good for the heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the studies have ended up negative. Short term, it may lower blood pressure, but it ends up with toxic immune-suppressive effects.

**Andrew Murray:** They are also specifically thyrotoxic (toxic to the thyroid).

**Caller:** What about sesame tahini or nuts?

**Andrew Murray:** It is a liquid oil, so it is polyunsaturated. To consume oil from nuts is consuming a large amount of product you wouldn't normally get exposed to. They oxidize very quickly.

**Caller:** Is CoQ10 good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is good. It works with Vitamin K to stabilize energy production.

## Caller: Weight Loss and Stored Fat

**Caller:** You've said it takes four years to change the saturated fat ratio of your cells. If you are overweight, does it take longer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you lose stored fat, it travels through your bloodstream. You want a steady supply of Vitamin E coming in—maybe 50 milligrams a day—to protect your blood vessels as the fat is removed.

Fruit and orange juice have safe antioxidants that protect you. Keeping your temperature steady at 98.6°F during the day keeps you burning energy productively rather than destructively. If you keep your liver energetic with a good diet (80 to 100 grams of protein) and keep your thyroid function up, your liver will be able to dispose of that unsaturated fat as a toxin without having to oxidize it.

**Andrew Murray:** So: gentle exercise, keep warm, ensure thyroid function is good, consume saturated fats (coconut oil), and drink orange juice.
