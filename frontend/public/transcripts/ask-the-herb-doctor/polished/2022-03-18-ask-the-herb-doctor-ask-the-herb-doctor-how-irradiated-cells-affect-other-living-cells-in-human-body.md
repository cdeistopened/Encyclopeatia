## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. It is March 18, 2022. You're listening to KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. Callers are invited to join us later with questions related to this month's continuing topic of MTOR and a further discussion of holistic versus mechanistic approaches to the treatment of disease. Without further ado, let's introduce Dr. Raymond Peat, who is joining us once again. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you as always for giving your time. I am constantly reminded of people who have never heard of alternatives to the standard model, whether it's treatment or chemicals. I cannot take it for granted that some people just don't know that alternatives exist. For those listening now and in the future archives, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology in graduate school, I was studying linguistics, literature, psychology, and teaching in those areas. I decided I needed more technical science background to understand how the brain works in the humanities and language. In 1968, I went to graduate school at the University of Oregon in biology. I finished my dissertation in 1972 in the area of reproductive physiological aging, specifically the changes of oxidative metabolism during aging and its effect on reproduction. I've been applying those insights to all sorts of problems in the 50 years since then.

## Holistic vs. Mechanistic Approaches to Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to carry on last month's topic regarding the research around MTOR—the mechanistic target of rapamycin—and its use in cancer. The bulk of the show will remain based on alternative approaches to cancer. We like to give the scientific background for the relevance of certain substances, whether natural or synthetic.

Dr. Peat, could you outline how alternatives have been usurped by the modern approach to disease? The machinery driving research is often corrupted by financial interests, and we haven't made significant increases in our knowledge of the treatment of cancer. Could you outline the history of thinkers like Szent-Györgyi and others who were steeped in biology rather than mechanistic approaches?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mechanistic materialist view reduces everything to a cause-and-effect relation between two simple bits of matter. That makes everything seem absolutely clear to the people who have defined science that way. When you focus on the interaction of just a few particles, you can understand those very clearly, but you miss the whole context.

People like Warburg and Szent-Györgyi looked at the whole picture of biology. Warburg saw things happening in yeast and cancer—specifically the production of lactate or lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen—and had the insight that this is very important about the nature of life.

Szent-Györgyi was following up on insights by others, such as W.F. Koch, and worked out the classical view of how oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism work. But he kept in mind the whole organism: what is going on at every level of water, energy supply, and interactions. He didn't focus on the reductionistic material interactions that ordinary science does.

As a result, Warburg's work was ridiculed and ignored for more than 50 years. It was only around the beginning of this century that his work from the 1920s started to be appreciated, though generally misunderstood. Szent-Györgyi's work on cancer involved things that biologists and doctors had never thought of—the idea of what electrons in water are doing, and how motion is the essential feature of life, powered by the organized flow of electrons. He applied that to cancer as well as muscle function and circulation.

Mainline science people are blind to this because it doesn't fit into reductionistic or mechanistic materialism.

**Andrew Murray:** The concept of a living organism interacting with its environment and being affected directly by it is largely ignored. In your quarterly newsletter, you mentioned the "cancer field" not as a theory, but as a reality.

We know about the bystander effect: if a cell is irradiated outside the body and introduced back into the body, it can have a damaging effect. This isn't because it's releasing high-energy electrons, but because the stress signals the cell gives out affect other cells. It is almost like a quantum physical event.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People were demonstrating the phenomenon 60 years ago. They knew that if you X-rayed an animal, you didn't have to X-ray the brain and pituitary to cause generalized hormonal changes. For example, if you irradiated a female's foot, the whole organism shifted its hormonal balance towards reproductive heat. That is an example of the whole body as a cancer field. The signal from the radiation is a holistic stress on the organism that spreads something that promotes cancer.

Mainstream biologists still insist that radiation causes spot damage to the DNA—a mutation in one gene—and that mechanistic damage somehow works its way out to become cancer. But that isn't a realistic picture. The radiation does something excitatory and pro-inflammatory to the organism separate from anything it might do to the DNA. That general stress reaction turns on signals that transmit estrogen-like signals all through the body. People have found that you can treat radiation poisoning and estrogen poisoning in the same way.

## Radiation and Dental X-Rays

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can I interrupt for a moment? Dr. Peat, is this why you strongly recommend against any form of radiation, but specifically dental X-rays? Because X-rays damage fast-dividing cells, and a dental X-ray affects your brain, eyes, thyroid, and tongue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid cancer, tonsil cancer, eye cancer, and brain cancer have all increased along with the intensity of dental X-rays. A study in Seattle put a lead shield over the abdomen of pregnant women and found that a full set of dental X-rays—even with the thyroid and pelvis shielded—caused the babies to be born underweight and underdeveloped, the same way any stress or excess estrogen would do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the stress of that dental X-ray spread all the way down to the uterus and the developing baby.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, everything in the body.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to discuss the term "cancer field." You wrote that the tumor itself has a radiating pattern of damage. Essentially, there is a gradient of damage from the central tumor out to distant tissues that are pre-cancerous, propagated by a pathway similar to the bystander effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any intense stress, like oxygen or glucose deficiency, will reduce efficient oxygen metabolism and cause stress signals. When one area responds intensely to stress, you get a local version of the bystander effect.

A cell that is approaching or has turned into cancer will chronically produce an excess of lactic acid, even when it gets oxygen. There will be a gradient of lactic acid surrounding that cell that irritates nearby cells, which then begin producing lactic acid. That spreads through solid tissue. This diffusion causes a visible gradient of deterioration, including DNA damage and mutations.

Factors diffusing out of an injured cell include carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and inflammatory cytokines. These are normal healing factors—like activating local estrogen production to repair tissue—but when prolonged, they spread the damage.

## The MTOR, PI3K, and AKT Pathways

**Andrew Murray:** I read an article discussing the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, and MTOR pathway as a three-branched signaling pathway. It stated that approximately 70% of ovarian and breast cancers and 90% of lung adenocarcinomas show aberrant activation of this pathway.

Last month we discussed MTOR. You mentioned MTOR 1 and MTOR 2. Could you outline those again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** MTOR 1 is an activating, phosphorylating enzyme. When you are normally fed and growing, it mediates between eating more and growing more. If you overeat, you tend to overproduce this growth factor, which leads to degenerative diseases. Excess calorie intake and intracellular calcium activate MTOR.

MTOR 2 does similar things but is fairly insensitive to usual signals like overeating. It depends mostly on growth hormone. Many kinds of stress will turn on an excess of growth hormone. Women have high levels of growth hormone compared to men as a result of estrogen's stress-inducing effect.

**Andrew Murray:** And these growth hormones are proliferative agents that would promote cancer growth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** It seems that these three arms—PI3K, AKT, and MTOR—are targets for shutting down the energy pathway. I have trouble reconciling this, given that thyroid hormone and progesterone are anti-inflammatory and energy-conservative. Is shutting down the energy production side beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Overeating and MTOR tend to favor the oxidation of fats over glucose. When that happens, you are slowing down the constructive part of energy metabolism and shifting towards these risky, simple growth pathways.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about using flavonoids—biologically active molecules found in fruits and vegetables—to shut down these pathways? I saw references to resveratrol, blueberries, and Chinese herbs like *Platycodon grandiflorus* and *Magnolia grandiflora* being used as AKT and MTOR inhibitors. How do these antioxidants fit into a holistic anti-cancer approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They do directly quench free radicals and are protective that way. But I think their more basic effect is that they intensify the cell's normal cytochrome oxidase-based oxidation. By speeding up the energy-producing oxidation through the electron transport chain, that process prevents the random oxidation that creates free radical damage.

It is more fundamental to intensify respiratory energy than to use the "antioxidant" function. Cancer is better than anything at creating antioxidant effects to defend itself. Chemotherapy and radiation try to kill cancer via free radical damage, but cancer has an antioxidant system that uses high production of electrons (from lactic acid) to quench them. However, it fails to activate normal energy-producing oxidation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you were going to be exposed to X-rays, what foods or supplements would you use to protect yourself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things such as thyroid, magnesium, and progesterone, which promote the production of carbon dioxide rather than lactic acid. And then all of these other protective things: flavonoids, caffeine, aspirin, and so on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, cancer involves a lot of inflammation, and these compounds act as anti-inflammatories and increase normal cellular respiration.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that is the secret of thyroid function. It is anti-inflammatory by directing oxygen towards consuming electrons that would otherwise cause inflammation.

## Energy Metabolism and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding second-generation MTOR inhibitors, described as "ATP competitive inhibitors," do you think molecules that compete with ATP—the energy currency of the cell—have value?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That doesn't sound like it will end well. The essential thing you need is to stabilize the cells.

**Andrew Murray:** You always mention sugar being very important—not starving someone of sugar, even for cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starving cancer emits signals that tell the body to convert its own tissues—muscles, skin, nerves—to amino acids which can be turned into glucose. When you starve a cancer cell, it tells the body to break itself down to provide the food it wants.

**Andrew Murray:** They also discussed blocking the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF), which drives angiogenesis (creation of new vessels).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That tends to go with activating carbonic anhydrase, which is the cell's way of disposing of acidic carbon dioxide. But when that is too active, it causes the cell to become alkaline, leading to the production of lactic acid. Central to cancer metabolism is creating alkalinity inside the cell.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw a list of natural MTOR inhibitors: Turmeric, Resveratrol, EGCG (green tea), Caffeine, Ginger (specifically for colon cancer), and Metformin. Do you have anything good to say about Metformin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drawback is that it acts to inhibit part of the electron transport chain, so it impairs the mitochondria while also doing the beneficial thing of turning off MTOR. It's good to be cautious about Metformin, but its effects are generally protective through inhibiting MTOR.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think these substances have value for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, specifically regarding amyloid beta?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Inflammation is involved in all degenerative processes. Anti-inflammatory, anti-MTOR things are turning out to be protective against obesity, Alzheimer's, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus—anything you can think of turns out to involve inflammation at its root.

## Caller Questions: Supplements vs. Whole Foods

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take a caller. You're on the air.

**Margaret (Caller):** Hello. I use turmeric daily. There is a tendency in our society to find something like turmeric and put it in capsules to take in high doses. Is it really beneficial to take extracts, or is it better to use it in your ordinary diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you can overeat on the so-called protective things. Same with Vitamin C; instead of being an antioxidant, it becomes a pro-oxidant when it begins producing excess electrons itself.

**Andrew Murray:** I think some of this comes from studying populations in countries that use it in their cuisine, like the Indian subcontinent. They have low incidences of colorectal cancer.

**Margaret (Caller):** But they use it as a matter of course in their daily lives. We tend to load ourselves up with it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yes, eating your medicine instead of taking capsules is good. Also, traditional cultures often make teas. This extracts the medicinal constituents without the extra fiber and potential heavy metals found in the root that don't get extracted into the tea.

**Andrew Murray:** That is a very good point. Having looked at botanicals through mass spectrometry, I know the plant root can contain high levels of heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), but the extracts contain virtually none. The extraction process is very clean compared to the raw root.

**Margaret (Caller):** Thank you very much.

## Caller Questions: Sugar Types and Safety

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Margie (Caller):** Hi, I'm from Pepperwood. I would like a clarification. When Dr. Peat says "sugar," does that mean just fructose, honey, or natural sugars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is also good coming from starch or other complex carbohydrates. But the problem is some of those, like sweet potatoes, are mixtures containing woody material and fats—indigestible things. You can't say that any starch is equivalent to glucose, sucrose, or honey. It depends on whether it is digestible.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can I go back to the sugar and cancer issue? Every cell needs glucose. If you don't eat sugar, your body turns on a harmful metabolism to make sugar involving lactic acid and cortisol, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and high cortisol is necessary to mobilize and break down protein to make amino acids and glucose, which also promotes cancer. It weakens your immunity.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you would recommend honey or cane sugar over fructose because of the processing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Pure fructose on the market often has allergenic effects for many people because of its manufacturing. You have to be cautious about powdered fructose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you don't recommend people just eat white sugar by the tablespoon without balancing it with a healthy saturated fat or protein to prevent a spike?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can be used in a pure form, for example, as a mild analgesic for babies. Also, in areas lacking penicillin, big wounds have been packed with pure white sugar. It has a germicidal effect as well as a protective effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Honey is used for wounds as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, so it has specific therapeutic effects besides its nutritional effects. One thing I want to mention before we finish is that Vitamin D is a very important inhibitor of MTOR because it works on many other levels. It reduces the processes that would amplify inflammation, such as blocking prostaglandin formation.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, we appreciate you joining us again. Thank you so much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
