## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, my wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

This month's subject is diabetes and Dr. Peat's latest research on diabetes. We are very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat to the show. Dr. Peat, can you hear us okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, perfect.

**Andrew Murray:** Even though you are a permanent fixture on the show, for those who have perhaps never listened to you, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been interested in biology for a long time but was doing other things—teaching English, linguistics, and such. In 1968, I decided to go back to graduate school to get a PhD at the University of Oregon. I graduated there in 1972, having specialized mostly in the physiology of reproduction and biochemistry. Since then, I've been following up on the same subjects related to oxidative metabolism, progesterone, estrogen, and thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** You have a very alternative view, but in terms of the research, it's actually not that alternative. It's just that the research doesn't surface anywhere near as quickly as we'd like compared to what doctors are taught regarding the cause of metabolic disorders.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A big part of the problem is that medical journals are totally separate from science journals. Years ago, before the internet, *Index Medicus* was a list of medical journal articles similar to PubMed now. I occasionally compared things that I would find in *Biological Abstracts* or *Chemical Abstracts*. When I looked things up later in *Index Medicus*, I found that there was usually a delay of 20 or 30 years after the discovery of something absolutely essential, such as the role of coenzyme Q10 in metabolism.

## The Definition and History of Diabetes

**Andrew Murray:** Onto this month's topic: diabetes and fat. Before we get into the actual causes, would you outline the standard definition and cause of diabetes from the perspective of current medical understanding?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The medical understanding has changed very little in the last 200 years. It was called the "sugar disease." In ancient times, it was named because of the excess urination; the urine contained a lot of glucose, and people craved sugar. Then they discovered the blood was loaded with glucose, so the medical concept became that it was the sugar disease. The standard cure was to make them unable to eat sugar—imprison them if necessary—and they would just die anyway. But they kept them from satisfying their sugar hunger.

Then insulin was discovered. For the people who were wasting away with what later was called Type 1 diabetes, insulin would allow them to build muscle and put on fat instead of breaking tissues down. But the "sugar disease" concept stayed with the medical profession, even though insulin deficiency came to be the idea of its cause.

As they looked for more ways to sell insulin, they noticed that lots of people who weren't wasting away and dying at a young age also had very high blood sugar. Some had sugar in their urine, yet when they tested their blood, they found it had a normal amount of insulin. They were good candidates for treatment, so it came to be called Type 2 diabetes, even though the original concept was that diabetes was a wasting disease. Now, fat people became 95% of the patients for treatment of their high blood glucose. So, it definitely isn't a problem of insulin deficiency for the great majority of people diagnosed with diabetes.

## Fat, Inflammation, and the True Cause of Diabetes

**Andrew Murray:** How does the current medical model of diabetes differ from the research perspective on the cause?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the late 19th century, two doctors doubted the theory that it was from eating too much sugar because patients died even faster when they made them not eat any sugar. They began feeding patients—first one patient with each doctor—letting them eat all the sugar they wanted, which was something like three-quarters of a pound a day of pure sugar added. They very quickly recovered from the wasting disease and were able to go back to work after a few weeks of this super-high sugar diet.

Gradually, their followers saw that fructose was part of the sucrose molecule, which got into cells and was metabolized without needing insulin. For 50 or 60 years, many diabetics were able to eat a normal amount of sweetener in the form of fructose. However, that never became the dominant treatment.

Experiments looking for the cause of Type 1 diabetes in young kids turned out to show it was sort of an autoimmune problem—inflammation killing off the beta cells. In vitro and in animal experiments, you can stimulate the growth of stem cells in the pancreas with glucose. So, it isn't glucose that's responsible for killing those cells; it's an inflammation reaction. The inflammation causes the breakdown of fatty acids, which cause free radical injury to the tissue.

Because of that observation involving prostaglandins and unsaturated fatty acids, a few experimenters put lab animals on a totally fat-free diet, giving them only saturated fats or no fat at all—just carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and minerals. They then tried to give them diabetes by all the standard methods of poisoning the beta cells of the pancreas. These fat-free animals didn't develop experimental diabetes the way all other animals do.

Experimentally, it's been pretty well demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids breaking down produce inflammation, which activates many of the processes seen in diabetes. The degenerative processes in the retina and nerves, for example, are where the damage starts, very often before the blood sugar increases at all. If you are getting retinal degeneration or numb and tingly hands and feet while having normal blood sugar, it's clearly not the sugar responsible for the degenerative changes.

**Andrew Murray:** So you're pointing the finger of blame at free fatty acid liberation and the oxidative damage that occurs from that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The unsaturated fatty acids happen to create a vicious circle because they create stress. The stress activates the stress hormones, which provide fat from the tissues as emergency fuel. This liberates more of the unstable polyunsaturated fats, creating more free radical damage, creating more stress, liberating more fats, and so on. Purely saturated fats, when liberated, tend to turn off those stress hormones.

**Andrew Murray:** That is another good reason to avoid liquid oils, fish oils, and all the other oils that are very unsaturated.

## Metformin and Lactic Acidosis

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to mention medications. I know quite a few people use Metformin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Phenformin was the first form of that used widely in the 50s and 60s, but it was killing a very high proportion of people. They were dying much earlier than they would have with no treatment at all. It was causing lactic acidosis by causing the mitochondria to be unable to oxidize glucose, which was exactly the problem of diabetes.

That got a bad reputation and was replaced by Metformin, which was reputed to not cause lactic acidosis. But even on PubMed, if you look up Metformin and lactic acid, you'll see more than 100 articles warning about the production of lactic acidosis with this standard treatment. It works partly by poisoning the mitochondria so that the cells are forced to produce lactic acid. It lowers blood sugar by wasting the glucose, turning it into lactic acid.

## Nerve Damage and the Randle Cycle

**Andrew Murray:** We understand that there are a lot of protective effects that sugar confers to the organism from a cellular energy standpoint. What other beneficial effects does sugar have when you look at it from a diabetic perspective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I looked up what current journals say are the mechanisms that cause nerve damage in diabetes. They have a standard four or five chemical or functional changes of nerve cells that they say are caused by excess glucose. They occur in the presence of excess glucose in the diabetic, but they also occur before or without the presence of glucose. Deficiency of glucose is one of the things that can induce these same defensive reactions that are blamed on sugar.

When you look at the symptoms associated with diabetes, you see that hormone changes typically go with it. Stress induces aromatase, which increases estrogen production. Stress increases growth hormone, which provides fuel in an emergency by increasing free fatty acids in the circulation. Growth hormone is very closely connected with estrogen. So, females have higher estrogen, growth hormone, and free fatty acids in circulation. It happens that females have much more often problems with the degenerative nerve symptoms of diabetes.

The effect of free fatty acids on stress, and sugar's protection against those stress reactions, is one of the basic things to look at in avoiding hypoglycemic stress long before the problem reaches the stage of producing hyperglycemia.

In hyperglycemia, what you have is the body's adjustment to the inability of cells to get enough energy because they can't oxidize glucose because the fats are blocking it. That's been known since the 1960s, called the Randle cycle, in which free fatty acids block the use of glucose. The body tries to overcome that poisonous effect of the free fatty acids by increasing glucose production. It gets around the block just by stuffing more glucose into the blood. To a great extent, the rising blood sugar shouldn't be fought in itself. The cause that interferes with the use of glucose should be concentrated on.

## Thyroid and Diabetes

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When cells can't get enough glucose, it not only turns on the stress hormones, it turns off the production of thyroid hormone. If the cell isn't able to take up and use glucose, the liver becomes unable to activate the pre-thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4), turning it into the active T3.

Supplementing active T3 thyroid hormone will cure lots of the so-called effects of diabetes. I had an old friend whose toes were basically rotting because of what was diagnosed as diabetes—degenerative nerve and circulation problems. Two weeks after he started using Armour Thyroid, his feet recovered completely. His toes had been black with ulcerated sores going right into the bones, but they completely healed up on thyroid. We went through three cycles where his doctor said the Armour Thyroid was going to increase his blood sugar and make his diabetes worse. He would tell him to stop it, and his feet would start rotting again.

**Andrew Murray:** So it wasn't just a coincidence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We did it three times.

## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We have a listener from Leggett who has a friend with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning and possible brain damage. They are interested in nutritional ideas to address that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) is one of the things that helps restore the cells that are damaged by carbon monoxide. Good vitamin nutrition is helpful. Thyroid hormone is the main thing we need to produce carbon dioxide, which is protective.

The diabetic or hypothyroid person is not producing enough energy from oxygen and glucose. They very easily turn some of the glucose into lactic acid. Lactic acid displaces carbon dioxide from the blood, and that has a stress-producing effect throughout the body. By simply breathing less rapidly, or breathing in a bag occasionally to rebreathe and save your carbon dioxide, you can increase the CO2 in tissues. This activates the Krebs cycle, stabilizes cells, and shuts down the production of lactic acid. It has a direct connection to the things that go wrong in diabetes as well as hypothyroidism.

## Starch Particles and Persorption

**David (Caller):** Hello, Dr. Peat. I've heard you refer to starch molecules as crystal-like structures that actually block capillaries if they get into the bloodstream. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. Is this well known in the scientific community?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it was something discovered a hundred years ago. In the 1970s, a German immunologist named Gerhard Volkheimer wrote some papers on it. It's called **persorption**. There is an article of his on the internet called "Persorption" that has illustrations of the junk that can get squeezed right through the lining of the intestine. It isn't being squeezed between cells necessarily; it can go right into the cytoplasm on one side and out the other.

Particles as big as 100 microns—potato starch particles, for example—can pass through. If you eat a slurry of raw corn starch or potato starch on an empty stomach, a few minutes later you can draw blood and find these particles. Some are the size of a red blood cell, but others are 10 times the diameter. Red blood cells are flexible, but starch particles will plug up an arteriole and shut down circulation to a whole block of capillaries fed by that arteriole.

Volkheimer would feed mice a high content of free starch in their diet. He found that they aged prematurely. When he sliced them up, he found that all of their organs contained little nests of dead, deteriorating cells downstream from the plug of one of these starch molecules.

**David (Caller):** Does the body see this as an irritant and try to expel it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body can produce enzymes pretty much anywhere that can break down starch, but they can stay in place long enough for the tissue to die.

**David (Caller):** So when we eat a potato with coconut oil or butter, does that allow it to slide through the intestine rather than going into the bloodstream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's very well cooked, it makes the starch particle easier to break down in the intestine. The fat delays the absorption, so it has time to break down more before it's absorbed.

**David (Caller):** You mentioned silicates used to make machinery run smoothly for vitamins and supplements. Would those be "junk" elements that lodge in vessels too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. And the chemically modified cellulose molecules that are in practically everything—some of those are toxic in themselves. The silica particles not only get into the tissue, but they have a toxic, allergenic, or immunological effect. Gerhard Volkheimer was especially concerned about their role in degenerative and immune diseases.

It seems to be an activation of inflammation reactions. The **inflammasome** particle responds to a certain shape of particle. So if it has a given shape, it doesn't matter too much whether it's asbestos, carbon, silicon, or wood. Volkheimer showed that not only do they plug up blood vessels about 15 minutes after they can be detected in the blood, but they can be found in the liver, in the bile, and in the cerebrospinal fluid right into the brain.

**David (Caller):** Could that contribute to psoriasis and skin disorders by reaching surface capillaries?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's theorized to contribute to things like scleroderma. Silicone from breast implants has been connected to generalized scleroderma, but even the silica particles used as food additives are suspected of activating inflammatory skin hardening diseases.

## Pregnancy, Stress, and Acne

**Caller (Garberville):** You mentioned that for pregnant women, the best thing you can do is keep them unstressed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and one of the essential things of stress is falling blood sugar.

**Caller (Garberville):** So if Mama craves chocolate, peanut butter, ice cream, or pickles, it's probably a good thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Glucose is essential for the baby's brain development. Many older gynecologists knew that diabetic women often had the brightest babies. Even hugely fat women who had diabetes often produced extremely healthy and intelligent babies specifically because of the increased blood sugar.

**Caller (Garberville):** Regarding hypoglycemia and acne: When I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia and had really bad acne. Could that be tied back to the amount of unsaturated fat I consumed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A man named Damke Wicks showed about 30 or 40 years ago that lowering blood sugar activates the inflammatory process, and doubling the blood sugar will stop allergies to almost everything. So every episode of hypoglycemia is stressing your immune system as well as activating the stress hormones that compensate by turning protein into sugar.

**Caller (Garberville):** Do you expect that was related to my intense craving for sugar, like donuts and cola?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the natural thing. Like in pregnancy or premenstrually, when your blood sugar falls, you crave sugar. If your thyroid is temporarily depressed by stress, eating a pound of sugar over a period of three days will sometimes replenish the glycogen stores in all of your tissues, including the liver, where the liver uses it to activate the thyroid hormone.

**Caller (Garberville):** I'm almost 35 and still have the acne. Does the stress come from the unsaturated fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's probably the most common reason, but many kinds of stress can bring it on. There is a great book by Broda Barnes called *Hypoglycemia: It's Your Liver, Not Your Mind*. He pointed out that the liver provides three-quarters of our active thyroid hormone, and to do that it needs glucose. Without the active thyroid hormone, you tend to get hypoglycemia.

## Ovarian Cysts

**Caller (Vancouver, WA):** I have cysts growing on my ovaries. They are at 6.9 centimeters and I'm 79 years old. My question is, do I have them removed now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you should have your blood hormones measured. The cysts could be producing a lot of estrogen. Have you had ultrasounds?

**Caller (Vancouver, WA):** Yes, every six months. They are enlarging slowly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The blood test might show what's needed to break them. Sometimes just one dose of progesterone is all that's needed for the cyst to break in the way it should during a normal menstrual cycle.

**Caller (Vancouver, WA):** Is there a risk with surgery at my age?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. If you're underweight especially and over 70, any surgery increases all kinds of risks of dying in the six months following the surgery.

**Andrew Murray:** Progesterone is a very safe compound, certainly far safer than surgery. There is a product called Progest-E, which is a natural progesterone.

**Caller (Vancouver, WA):** Listening to Dr. Oz, he said if you get to eight centimeters you have to have them taken out.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known quite a few younger women with big cysts that were causing pain. With just one or two doses of progesterone, the cyst simply broke and they had no more problem.

## Niacinamide and Vitamin A

**Caller (Kansas City):** I have a question about niacinamide. In one of your articles, you said it can cause tumor cells to either mature or disintegrate, but it prolongs the replicative life of cultured cells. Could you explain that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's needed to produce energy efficiently, and it lowers stress. The increased energy and reduced stress simply stop the processes that tend to promote cancer. Its main effect is protective. For nerve cells, for example, almost anything that injures a nerve cell is protected against by niacinamide.

**Caller (Kansas City):** Regarding vaginal dryness, you mentioned using a suppository with Vitamin A and E in cocoa butter. What is a safe high dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To make a suppository, if you are using pure cocoa butter, you can get probably 1,000 milligrams of Vitamin E and maybe 20,000 International Units (IU) of Vitamin A to dissolve in one suppository.

**Caller (Kansas City):** How much Vitamin A is safe to take internally? I have Hashimoto's and liver issues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the status of your thyroid. Thyroid hormone and Vitamin A are carried on the same protein in the blood. If you take too much Vitamin A, it can act as an antagonist to thyroid. It acts like polyunsaturated fat in competing against the thyroid hormone. But 10,000 units a day is good if your thyroid is okay. People with very high thyroid activity sometimes need 50,000 IU because the increased thyroid raises the requirement.

**Caller (Kansas City):** I am taking thyroid hormones for Hashimoto's. Would 10,000 be too much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Unless you're sure that your metabolic rate is up, it's good to limit it to about 10,000 units a day.

## Dietary Advice for Diabetics

**Mike (Caller):** What would you recommend that somebody with diabetes—who is given all this propaganda about avoiding sugar—eat to get a start and see benefits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruit is the best way to get your sugar. Orange juice is the most reliable way to get sugar with every meal. Milk is very important for several reasons: as a source of protein, and the high calcium has an anti-stress effect. So emphasize milk, cheese, protein, eggs, and fruits, while avoiding the starchy fruits like bananas.

If you actually have a problem with high blood sugar, supplementing brewer's yeast and aspirin are things that can help to actually lower the blood sugar. And a thyroid supplement sometimes will help.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are going to have to hold it there. Dr. Peat can be found online at www.raypeat.com. There are plenty of scholarly articles there, specifically on metabolic disorders, thyroid disorders, hormones, and aging.

Thank you so much again, Dr. Peat. And thank you to our callers from New York, Washington, Kansas, and Missouri. Until next month.
