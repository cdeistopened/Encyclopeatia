## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the shows before, we run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 PM till 8:00 PM. We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine. We'll run the call-in lines live from 7:30 to 8:00. We are keen to have people asking questions about the relevant subjects we're going to bring out this evening, but if you do have any other questions, feel free. Let's get straight into introducing Dr. Peat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. We are very honored to have you on the show, giving your time freely as you have done countless times. For those who have never heard of you before—though I think they are decreasing in numbers as the internet spreads the truth about what you've been exposing for the last 40 years regarding mainstream medicine and dogma—would you let people know your educational and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From 1968 to 1972, I studied at the University of Oregon in Biology, specializing in physiology, especially reproductive aging physiology. Before that, it was linguistics and literature mostly. Since then, I've been studying the implications of the research I did for my PhD.

## Water Quality: Chlorine and Disinfection Byproducts

**Andrew Murray:** I know your specialty is thyroid and reproductive hormones. For tonight's topics, I wanted to carry on with nitrosamines, not just in food, but as a component of water. I want to discuss water quality, specifically regarding recent mandates by the EPA and how that ties into policies formed in allegiance with the United Nations.

I want to mention a gentleman named Richard Radcliffe, a chemist and water resource engineer who studied water for 15 years. He states that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of disinfection byproducts that form when chlorine is added to water. He says they can only identify about 50% of them and that most are likely to be carcinogenic.

For us, manufacturing medicinal herbs, we use spring water. We don't use municipal water. If I did, I would use bottled or spring water because the idea of having chlorine in the water and creating medicine from it is abhorrent. What is your view of chlorine in the water interacting with organic components to create byproducts, and how does that relate to human health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some city water departments have discovered that it's doable to use ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide, or ozone—various oxidizing methods that don't leave any residue. In fact, they tend to oxidize and detoxify any of the chemical contaminants that are in the water.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I heard from the Redway Water Department in our local area that they are thinking of using ultraviolet light to start disinfecting the water. Michael, did you have something to say?

**Michael (Engineer):** I'm actually on the Redway board. We do have a spring coming on which is very clean water to begin with, and we're planning on using an ultraviolet light to disinfect that. However, the state still makes us chlorinate it after that. Ultraviolet light does not kill some things, like Giardia. It's a tough technology to work with. I personally am very interested in it because our health is impacted by what comes out of the sewage waste treatment. For instance, any chromium you have becomes hexavalent chromium instead of divalent chromium.

**Andrew Murray:** We use UV as a post-treatment; everything gets filtered first.

**Michael (Engineer):** A good filtration helps a lot, but for city water, they really make you chlorinate stuff. Any commercial water you buy has likely been treated with chlorine and hyper-filtered. It's much more cost-efficient to buy the very best filter you can and use that on the municipal water.

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to you, Dr. Peat, on the chlorination issue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have to use city water, I think it's good to at least let it stand in an open container for 12 hours or so, or heat it to drive off as much of the chlorine and organic chlorides as possible.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you have any experience in the scientific literature about the effects of chlorine reacting with organic compounds to form toxic byproducts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No particular research, but chlorine is a very powerful oxidizer. It reacts with any carbon compound that happens to be dissolved in the water.

## Chloramines and Nitrosamines

**Andrew Murray:** Chlorine seems to be going out of fashion because it is volatile. Now they are using chloramines—a compound of ammonia and chlorine—because it is more persistent. It doesn't just evaporate, and it is extremely hard to filter out. I understand the toxic byproducts from chloramination are stated to be a thousand times more toxic. Have you heard of chloramination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just vaguely, but it relates to the research that started around 1970 on the nitrosamines. The chloramine largely breaks down to form the nitrosamines, specifically NDMA (N-Nitrosodimethylamine).

I think there is pressure from the food and agricultural industry to propagandize that nitrosamines aren't carcinogenic—which they were established to be 40-some years ago—because it's profitable to fertilize heavily with nitrogen fertilizer and preserve foods with nitrates and nitrites. There is a lot of propagandistic science publication going on saying that nitrites, nitrates, and even nitrosamines are not only non-carcinogenic but beneficial to health.

**Andrew Murray:** These are the very things they've been saying are carcinogenic in treated meat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a big thing around 1970 when they saw that babies fed pureed spinach sometimes turned blue because of the interference with hemoglobin, making it unable to carry oxygen. The nitrates do that even when we make them internally from proteins under stress. But because of the food industry's concern about selling their products, there has been a reaction claiming it was only a few farms with nitrate-contaminated water causing the "blue baby" problems. They tried to distract attention from the universally recognized tumor-promoting potential of nitrates, nitrites, and nitrosamines.

**Andrew Murray:** I also understand that chloramine is extremely toxic to kidney dialysis patients and fish.

**Michael (Engineer):** They are super toxic. The triclosan hand sanitizers are all that same chemistry. I inquired at my water district long before I was on the board about whether we used chlorine or chloramine. Our chemical supplier said, "I wouldn't even sell that poison," referring to chloramine.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding the potential toxins from byproducts reacting with chlorine and chloramines, it is a consequence of modern living. How do you feel about city water? You live in Eugene; do you do anything particular to your water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We always filter it. We never drink it straight out of the faucet, even though it comes from the McKenzie River, which is one of the least polluted rivers. Because of the chlorine issue, we never drink plain water. If you make coffee with city water, that's one of the practical ways of filtering it. Heavy metals are very efficiently bound to the coffee grounds if you use the drip method. You put in dirty water and get clean coffee out the other end.

## Caller: Medical Marijuana

**Caller (Whale Gulch):** I want to ask the doctor his opinion of medical marijuana and the possibility of its use for immunity to the world.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was about nine years old, a doctor prescribed marijuana and gave me a big paper bag—about half a cubic foot—of marijuana leaves to make a tea. I took it every day until the bag was used up, but I wasn't especially impressed by it. My problem was just migraines occasionally.

**Caller (Whale Gulch):** You have to be very careful. It's a very powerful herb. You want to take minute quantities to get the maximum gentle feeling.

## Iodoacids and Outgassing Chlorine

**Andrew Murray:** I saw a nationwide study by the EPA reporting that chloraminated drinking water had the highest levels of an unregulated chemical family known as iodoacids. Some researchers consider these potentially the most toxic group of water treatment contaminants found to date.

**Caller (Crescent City):** I've noticed when I take a bottle of water on a hike and open it, I get a blast of chlorine gas. I've started filling a cup of water and letting it sit around to outgas. Chlorine is a gas, so it's easy to get rid of. However, there are also molecules of organic matter that have already reacted with the chlorine that probably won't outgas.

**Andrew Murray:** The chlorine is the main culprit reacting with other organic compounds to create toxic byproducts. While you can release the chlorine gas into the atmosphere, the product itself produces toxic byproducts from the organic matter, and chloramine is even more potent at doing that.

**Caller (Crescent City):** An experiment somebody could do is let the water sit out for different periods, then bottle it, let it sit, and open it to see if you can smell the chlorine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chloroform and other chlorinated hydrocarbons are volatile too, so they will gas out.

## Water Filtration Recommendations

**Caller (Fort Bragg):** I was wondering about the best filtration system. Years ago, I marketed water filters, and we had a high-quality pressed carbon block filter that was supposed to be good for taking out chlorine and trihalomethanes. Also, the best location for a filter is the shower because the body is the largest organ.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carbon does absorb and even destroy some of the compounds, but it isn't a complete safety method.

**Andrew Murray:** We use Royal Doulton filters. They are ceramic filters developed in England that go down to about two angstroms—sub-micron. They have a micro-crystalline ceramic shell, a silver membrane, and an activated carbon block core with ion exchange resin. It takes out virtually everything but leaves the minerals and taste unchanged. It is endorsed by the World Health Organization for use in third-world countries. It requires at least 30 PSI, so it's good for a drinking water faucet.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They do have a whole house system too.

**Michael (Engineer):** I have a filter on my shower because I used to get a strong chlorine smell. It cost about 20 bucks at the health food store, screws in between the nozzle and pipe, and significantly reduces the smell.

## Global Warming and CO2

**Andrew Murray:** I want to open up the subject of global warming. I have seen convincing scientific evidence to refute it, and I want to discuss the financial background behind EPA mandates regarding carbon dioxide. Dr. Peat, I know you are an advocate of carbon dioxide in living systems.

I would point listeners to Lord Christopher Monckton, who has dedicated himself to exposing the lies about global warming. He presented at the Paris Climate Talks and delivered a speech to Congress in 2013 exposing falsehoods in Al Gore's documentary.

Dr. Peat, what is your opinion on CO2? Do you think we could do with less CO2, and what does the history of CO2 levels mean for plants and humans?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was the Carboniferous age when there was tremendous luxury and growth of vegetation because of high atmospheric carbon dioxide. One of the things that got me interested in the issue was a study in 1969 correlating the ratio of a baby's head size and chest circumference to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This showed evidence that brains were getting bigger as carbon dioxide increased.

Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere helps the body retain its proper amount of CO2, which inhibits wasteful lactic acid metabolism and stabilizes the nerves. I think the general trend of warming over the last hundred years is being driven by the sun's normal cycles. Several astronomers have shown evidence that the solar constant has been increasing in recent decades enough to fully account for planetary warming.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw evidence that throughout history, there is actually very little evidence to support global warming, but rather cooling. In the last 17 years, the Earth has actually cooled. I've seen Antarctic ice sheets increasing and polar bear species increasing. What worries me is the mandate for carbon taxes, which will disadvantage third-world countries that need energy production.

## Caller: Carbon Offsets and Travel

**Caller:** I have two things. First, regarding carbon sequestration: companies can buy carbon credits from trees to continue polluting. Second, airline travel causes massive pollution.

**Andrew Murray:** The very people who attended the Paris climate conference came in private aircraft. The people telling you to pay carbon taxes are the ones collecting them.

## Caller: Multipure Filters and Climate Change

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** Do you know anything about the Multipure water filter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think it's a carbon block filter.

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** On global warming, I don't see how you can say the overall temperature hasn't been going up when glaciers are withdrawing and ice is melting. It seems the overall temperature is getting warmer, though that might be beneficial. However, we have had a lot to do with it through wars, bombs, and electromagnetism.

**Andrew Murray:** The EPA has mandated a ban for 80% of wood-burning stoves in seven US states.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, are you aware of wood burning restrictions in Eugene?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, Eugene has it. For about 40 years, Eugene was polluted every summer to the point that the death rate from asthma peaked during the weeks they were burning grass fields. The timber industry was the main source of wood-burning pollution. Since they cut the forests down, there isn't that much wood available for heating. I don't think wood stoves are as much of an issue as the absence of forests. Forests are a major climate stabilizing factor by absorbing and releasing water and reflecting infrared.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I remember you telling me about a rainforest in South America that was cut down, causing the area to become a desert.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I saw that happening in Southern Mexico. After Oaxaca was deforested, the climate changed so much they could only get one corn crop per year rather than two or three. The trees were bringing in moisture and stabilizing the temperature. Without the forest, the land temperature increases sharply in summer, causing updrafts that create intense thunderstorms rather than cool, steady evaporation.

## Caller: Hashimoto's and Cholesterol

**Caller (Madison, Wisconsin):** My girlfriend has really low cholesterol (138) and Hashimoto's. I was curious if gelatin might raise the cholesterol, and how dysbiosis affects this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hashimoto's usually means low thyroid function, which is more common in women because estrogen inhibits the thyroid. Low thyroid then lets estrogen rise. Sometimes intestinal irritation can affect the liver so much that it doesn't make enough cholesterol.

**Caller (Madison, Wisconsin):** How is that influenced by dysbiosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The endotoxin poisons the liver and lets estrogen and other toxic metabolites increase. The liver needs available glucose to produce adequate cholesterol. Eating fruits, especially orange juice, will often bring a person's cholesterol up to normal.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If she replaces starchy carbohydrates with orange juice and has a cup of grated raw carrot at night to help with dysbiosis, that should help.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that's the right approach.

**Caller (Madison, Wisconsin):** She is a picky eater and doesn't get very hungry. Would gelatin help with her appetite or cholesterol?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Gelatin is anti-inflammatory for the intestine. In that way, it could help her liver be less irritated and thereby make more cholesterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly what Sarah said.

## Caller: Alternative Energy

**Caller (Brycelyn):** Shouldn't the US have converted to alternative powers like geothermal and solar rather than giving money to corrupted corporations? Also, we could burn trash using clean scrubbers.

**Andrew Murray:** I agree. Solar is fantastic in California.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Composting is a viable source of heat and methane production directly from the compost.

**Andrew Murray:** I have read that municipal landfills are starting to use methane as a viable byproduct.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And Straus Creamery makes electricity from the methane from their cows.

## Caller: Ocean Acidification and CO2 Levels

**Caller (Andy Caffrey, Garberville):** Organisms only evolve tolerances to circumstances their species evolved through. In intertidal marine biology, creatures in tide pools are eurythermal and euryhaline (wide tolerance), while ocean creatures are stenohaline. For the last 2.1 million years, CO2 has been between 170 and 290 ppm. We are now at 400 ppm. How can ecosystems tolerate this? Also, West Antarctica's collapse is unstoppable, leading to sea level rise. How can anyone say global warming is good?

**Andrew Murray:** You need to look at the alternative validated science from Lord Monckton. I can't give you the scientific answers, but I can point you to the person who can.

## Caller: The McDougall Diet

**Caller (Calgary, Alberta):** I'm wondering why people following the McDougall program, who eat tons of starch and vegetables, are able to reverse heart disease and lose weight?

**Andrew Murray:** What is your objective analysis of a starchy, carbohydrate-rich diet curing heart disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've talked to some of his patients, and I'm sure they aren't getting enough protein.
