## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who graduated in England with a degree in herbal medicine. We consult with people about a wide range of conditions to give nutritional advice. Dr. Raymond Peat is our special guest, and we generally cover a wide range of different subjects.

This month, I wanted to have a break from the endocrine topics we've been covering and discuss Dr. Peat's newsletter, specifically the one entitled "Language and Criticism." That will tie in nicely to an exposé by Carla Rothenberg, a Harvard graduate who discussed the mechanism by which the estrogen industry was protected. She details how estrogen was given good press and used in HRT and contraception, making billions of dollars for companies like Wyeth, Lilly, and Squibb.

We will also discuss how progesterone—which is the beneficial, anti-inflammatory hormone—was suppressed. Through misrepresentation and bad science, the anti-cancer benefits of progesterone were skewed in favor of estrogen. The estrogen industry's multi-billion dollar production of contraception and HRT fueled massive profits and a propagandistic "population reduction religion." Because of this skewed information, progesterone was added to the California Prop 65 list of known carcinogens. Big Pharma interests and lobbying maintained the disinformation, and academia followed compliance in doctrine and education.

## Language, Criticism, and Authoritarianism in Science

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat's newsletter outlined that a war against true science was being waged by an authoritarian industry, with regulators, lobbyists, government, and big interests maintaining a status quo of domination. It’s not a conspiracy theory; it is a fact that vested interests like pharmaceutical companies generate billions in revenue with drugs. We often find out later that reports were skewed in favor of the drug manufacturers, and evidence of negative effects was buried.

Dr. Peat, your newsletter compares the libertarian side of academia—the humanities, philosophy, the arts—versus the reductionist, scientific side. You mentioned that the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, as well as the CIA, actively identified individuals who could exert effects over organizations to steer culture.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The gene theory is really the best basis for an authoritarian theory of society. Konrad Lorenz developed the idea of genetically based behavior for Hitler and the Nazi party as the ideology for race supremacism and the elimination of "inferior" people. Exactly that ideology was taken up by American biologists as soon as the war was over.

Noam Chomsky's idea of generative grammar is structurally identical to Konrad Lorenz's genetically based theory of behavior. Chomsky's research has been financed since the 1950s by the Pentagon for use in war-making, but it is really the same ideology that Lorenz developed for social control and genocide.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned that the humanities were seen as a major obstacle to this authoritarian civilization.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I gave the example of C.P. Snow's famous article and lecture in the 1950s on the "Two Cultures." The ideology was that science was the basis of the true culture, and the humanities—art, philosophy, literature, religion—were obstacles to the progress of civilization.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because they were humane.

**Andrew Murray:** You said grammar was structured around this ideology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It started in the 1930s. Chomsky wasn't the originator of the idea; it came out of early computer thinking. They believed you needed a language that wasn't complex and fluid if you were going to put all knowledge into computers. Things had to be absolutely self-contained. They developed a theory of reality in which reality was made up of self-contained units where their position in space and time didn't affect them, essentially because they wanted the language to have a one-to-one relationship to reality.

Computers could only handle absolutely discrete units of information. So, the ideology of reality was set so that it worked in computers. That fit with the idea that each of our units of meaning is determined genetically by a discrete molecular structure. Behavior would be reduced to these discrete units. Grammar was simply one of the types of behavior that could be genetically determined. Chomsky was just one of the people completing this theory that genes control behavior, grammar is one of our behaviors, and so language can be reduced to these units.

## MK Ultra and Controlled Narratives

**Andrew Murray:** This reminds me of the MK Ultra program, which came out of the CIA's desire to control minds through language and trauma. It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but truth is often stranger than fiction. It’s not until people start looking over their shoulder that they see things are not the way they are told.

When I first came to this country in 2001, I met someone who talked about chemtrails. I thought she was crazy. But slowly, evidence came out regarding weather modification, GMO integration, and nanoparticles. It is hiding in plain sight. Between the World Health Organization and the European Union, there is a desire to control the narrative. Drugs and drug research are just another arm of that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Part of the control system is convincing people that medicine is really good for them, covering up the actual facts of vaccination and the total cancer picture. I think it's been fraudulent since the turn of the century.

Twenty-five years ago, when Donna Shalala declared that the cancer war was being won, I looked at the statistics and saw she was using fraudulent statistics to declare victory in 1994. I predicted then that they wouldn't be able to keep using those statistics because the Baby Boomers would be reaching cancer age in the year 2000. In that year, the National Statistics Bureau shifted; they no longer give raw data on cancer mortality, but only age-adjusted figures. It's almost impossible to put together a picture of what's really happening. However, in situations like young women with breast cancer, there is a very great increase in both incidence and mortality. They are doing their best to cover up the figures for cancer, asthma, degenerative diseases, and the effects of vaccination.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's "follow the money." If they aren't going to fund a study, we won't hear the truth. For example, radiologists see birth defects in women using fertility treatments, but fertility specialists say it's not a fact because it hasn't been studied. Why? Because there is no money to pay for studies on natural hormones like thyroid and progesterone that cannot be patented.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you’ve mentioned that when you were pursuing your PhD, libraries started pulling printed reference material and moving to digital formats, making older science-based research unavailable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I used to use *Biological Abstracts* and *Chemical Abstracts*, which went back to 1910. It filled a huge room. Suddenly, that whole room of abstracts disappeared about 10 or 15 years ago. I asked the librarian where they were, and they had been moved to a storage basement. I asked if I could request particular volumes, and they said no, they aren't indexed.

## Estrogen vs. Progesterone

**Andrew Murray:** We are going to open the lines for callers. But first, regarding the estrogen industry: Estrogen is a natural hormone, so why is it considered bad while progesterone is good? And isn't progesterone in birth control pills?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body makes a variety of hormones which are essential for acute reactions to stress—histamine, for example. Antihistamines are beneficial even though they are synthetic drugs turning off a natural substance; they can save lives. Estrogen, angiotensin, serotonin, and nitric oxide are other intrinsic natural hormones important for acute reactions to stress. But like histamine, when they are continued too long or at too high a concentration, they become deadly.

Estrogen was clearly identified as a cause of cancer over 100 years ago, around 1905.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I thought they knew in the 1800s that chimney sweeps were developing testicular cancer from the high estrogenic content of the coal soot.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The identity of estrogen as the carcinogen wasn't clearly chemically identified until about 1935. A series of papers came out warning against the use of estrogen for treatment because the chemical work made clear that the soot carcinogenesis known from the 18th century was essentially estrogenic—creating inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer.

In the 1930s, progesterone was identified as the protective agent against the carcinogenic effects of estrogen. For 20 years, from 1935 to 1955, that work continued, but it was submerged. The drug companies intervened to create their own storms. First, they claimed estrogen was a "female hormone" that would support pregnancy and retard aging.

Later, they realized progesterone was expensive to make and couldn't be patented. So, each company developed a synthetic product that had *some* of progesterone's actions. Progesterone was named for the ability to sustain gestation—*pro-gestational*. But the synthetic chemicals were given that name even though they blocked or destroyed gestation, creating immediate miscarriage. The FDA allowed these to be called "progestins." Worse, the FDA requires that natural progesterone be labeled with the warnings applicable to these toxic synthetics.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the progestins in birth control pills are not bioidentical progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct. They are anti-progesterone, actually.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We are also exposed to environmental estrogens—in food, leaching out of plastic bottles, and in the water supply.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most widespread synthetic estrogenic substances used in plastics. It's been known for about 120 years. The man who developed Diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the 1930s warned it shouldn't be used in humans, but drug companies immediately used it as a "female hormone" to prevent miscarriage, even though it was known to cause miscarriage and cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Are we exposed to natural bioidentical progesterone in our environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk naturally contains some progesterone, thyroid, and estrogen. But if the mother provided a large amount of estrogen, the milk would cause feminization of boy babies. It is obvious that natural milk contains predominantly progesterone.

## Caller: Headaches and CSF Leaks

**Caller:** I wake up every night with a headache. I traced it back to an injury in the nasal cavity, and I understand I'm leaking cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). It oozes water. I’ve handled my allergies, take thyroid, and follow the diet religiously. I’m 61.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a few weeks ago, I was talking to a girl who had similar symptoms associated with a high estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. Pregnenolone, DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens are protective. Estrogen makes the blood vessels leaky, and various types of inflammation can set off that leakiness. It isn't necessarily an injury. Vitamin D deficiency is one of the things that can increase the leakiness of the membranes. Has yours been tested?

**Caller:** Yes, it was very high at one time, in the 80s or 90s, so I brought it down to the 50s.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you watch your calcium-to-phosphate ratio?

**Caller:** Yes, one meat meal a day with gelatin. I drink two quarts of milk and orange juice.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Have you had your estradiol-to-progesterone ratio tested?

**Caller:** I don't want to do any puncturing or blood draws.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you tried supplementing pregnenolone or progesterone?

**Caller:** Yes. The issue stems from a ballooning endocranial adjustment to my nose. I wake up at 2 or 3 AM. I drink coffee and sit in a bathtub for 40 minutes to drain it out.

**Andrew Murray:** That is definitely the time of day where you are most subjected to cortisol in terms of low blood sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What about antihistamines? Or aspirin?

**Caller:** I take aspirin, three tablets a day. I don't take antihistamines.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about cyproheptadine, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that is the safest antihistamine because it also takes down serotonin excess.

**Caller:** I tried that, but I got restless legs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You might try a tenth of the normal dose. After you've used typical doses of 1 or 2 milligrams, you can become more sensitive and get a good reaction from a tenth of a milligram. One other substance that has some anti-histamine, anti-leakiness effects is emodin, found in cascara or rhubarb root.

**Caller:** I do take cascara. I also use pregnenolone, about two scoops.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I first tried pregnenolone, I took about 3,000 milligrams a day for a year and felt great with no side effects. Studies on rats with massive doses showed no harmful side effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I noticed personally that I didn't feel an effect at 100mg, but at 350mg, I noticed a very positive effect.

## Caller: Bioidentical Hormones and Cycling

**Caller:** I'm 76. I've been on bioidentical estrogen and progesterone for 20 years. I use E2 and E3 topical cream, really low dose, and 50mg of progesterone. It keeps the hot flashes away. What do you think of bioidentical estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s and 40s, Alexander Lipschutz tested the effects of very small doses of estrogen on animals. He saw that if that small dose was continuous, it would be carcinogenic to every tissue. However, if you interrupted it regularly—the way the body does with menstruation and the luteal phase where you have progesterone in huge amounts for two weeks—that interrupts the carcinogenic effect. Even a big surge of estrogen isn't carcinogenic as long as you're protecting it with a good dose of progesterone. It doesn't matter that the dose is small; it's the discontinuity that is protective.

**Caller:** If I interrupt it, won't I get hot flashes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, estrogen turns on nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator and causes leakiness of the blood vessels.

**Caller:** I use E2 and E3.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They all have the same effects but at different doses. Estriol (E3) is about 10 times weaker than estradiol (E2). But it is still harmful if you don't interrupt it.

**Caller:** How long do I interrupt it for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something approaching the body's two weeks is probably ideal, but I think a week with a progesterone supplement is probably safe enough.

**Caller:** So you don't see much difference between synthetic and bioidentical?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estradiol is the powerful natural one. Ethinyl estradiol (synthetic) has an added group that makes it stay in the body 17 times longer. E2 is the strongest natural one.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why don't you try cutting out the E2 and just using the E3 for two weeks out of the month, while using the progesterone the whole cycle? You might find you don't have hot flashes at all.

## Caller: Plastics and Food

**Peter (Caller):** My question is related to estrogen research. I understand substances like BPA in plastics are estrogenic. Are there certain types of foods, maybe more acidic or basic, that are more likely to leach these substances into the food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know of any effects of the pH of the food. But it's important to keep your protein and B-vitamins up. Deficiency in those will allow the liver to let estrogen build up in your body. Protein and Vitamin B1 are the main anti-estrogen nutrients.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** A colleague from Oxford University found that if plastic water bottles are room temperature, they leak fewer plasticizers. If they are cold or frozen, they become brittle and leach much more plastic compounds into the water.

**Andrew Murray:** With the advent of this information, there is much more effort to produce HDPE and other safer plastics.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But not in "to-go" foods. If it's in the refrigerator, it's going to be leaching more plastics.
