## Introduction: Antioxidants and Myths

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome. Every third Friday of the month we produce a program called *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show to share his wisdom. This month's subject is antioxidants: some of the myths about them, what they really do, how they are helpful, and how the history of antioxidants has been skewed. Our current understanding has been misled by manufacturers and other parties.

We are coming into the fall, and as the daylight hours decrease, most people are under a certain amount of stress. I think we all know antioxidants as anti-stress or at least free radical quenching agents, but we are going to explore them in more depth. Dr. Peat, for those who haven't heard of you, would you please outline your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have taught at several universities, various courses related to biology and biochemistry. For example, in Mexico, I taught immunology and intermediate metabolism. My research was in reproductive aging at the University of Oregon. My dissertation advisor, Arnold Soderwall, happened to be a major figure in Vitamin E research. He found that hamsters remained fertile much longer if he gave them increasingly large doses of Vitamin E. Although I didn't work with Vitamin E myself, that was the background for my research with estrogen, progesterone, and oxidative metabolism.

## The Body's Antioxidant System

**Andrew Murray:** I think most people have a medical understanding of what we commonly know as antioxidants. I know you're going to describe some of the ill effects that some antioxidants can have because they can work both ways. Would you outline the effects of antioxidants and the body's system of antioxidants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People often talk about the body's innate antioxidant system. They usually refer to the glutathione in cells and the enzymes that reduce glutathione when it has been oxidized. Superoxide dismutase and catalase are considered to be at the center of our own antioxidant system, with uric acid as a circulating major protection against free radicals.

**Andrew Murray:** Can I hold you there for a second? Uric acid is something that I was always led to believe was a cause of gout. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is involved. Being an antioxidant, it's also involved in protecting against inflammation, because inflammation involves things that are thought of as oxidative damage. Molecules get oxidized and changed. Even though uric acid is probably defensive against inflammation, it tends to eventually get crystallized in the process of defending against the inflammation. You often find crystals of uric acid in an inflamed joint, but people can have crystals of uric acid in the tissue with no symptoms at all. Symptoms like gout can occur without the crystals. Crystals of phosphate are probably more common in gout than uric acid crystals, but without analyzing them, people consider them to be uric acid.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's more the inflammation that someone would have anyway, whether in soft tissue or joint, that uric acid would come onto the scene to be an antioxidant for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Apparently. It is considered quantitatively our main antioxidant defense inside cells. Glutathione is considered the main one because it's the reductant that can block a lot of oxidative molecules.

## Superoxide Dismutase and Ionized Air

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned superoxide dismutase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Recently, some studies of roundworms and aging have found that superoxide dismutase actually might shorten their longevity. A lot of things are being reconsidered regarding superoxide. For example, in the ionized air effect, in which negative air ions have anti-inflammatory effects, it turns out that superoxide—which many people think of as one of the worst oxidants—happens to be produced when we breathe negatively ionized air. It's produced in the lung, and the lung is the main place where serotonin is detoxified and destroyed. Serotonin is destroyed in the lungs under the influence of superoxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why they say if you walk along the seashore and there are breaking waves, the release of negative ions is supposed to help your lungs, especially for asthmatics? Is that because it's lowering the serotonin in their lungs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is a series of papers done in Poland that call it the "serotonin irritation syndrome." They concluded, after about a 20-year series of studies, that the ions are helping to destroy serotonin in the lungs. The superoxide dismutase that destroys superoxide has been thought of as a defense against this free radical, but we don't necessarily just want to increase that antioxidant because sometimes it's involved with making inflammation worse if we get rid of too much superoxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when you hear research coming out about a new antioxidant being discovered, we have to look into it a little bit more because it could be counterproductive to have too much of some of these wonderful antioxidants.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Advertisements often say a chemical is 100 times better as an antioxidant than Vitamin E, but that doesn't mean it's going to be safe in the body. Vitamin E fits into this system of superoxide, glutathione, Vitamin C, and uric acid in a very tightly organized system. If you put in something that's 100 times more active against oxidants or free radicals *in vitro*, you really don't have any idea what it's going to do in the body.

## Polyphenols, Tannins, and Estrogens

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main plant substances that are now being called antioxidants are mostly polyphenolic compounds. There is almost a 100% overlap between the polyphenolics as antioxidants and the polyphenolics as estrogens. I was thinking about that overlap and how 30 or 40 years ago, these same chemicals were classed together as tannins. 50 or 60 years ago, someone discovered that tannins help to seal the skin of a burned person to prevent seepage—called an eschar. After doing that for maybe 20 or 30 years, they started seeing that it was a carcinogen. In the 70s, tannins were identified as very effective carcinogens.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about the topical use of tannins? That was big in herbal medicine school.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what turned up in the 70s—people who had been treated topically for burns were getting skin cancer in the area treated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you list some examples of these polyphenols or tannins that are associated with increasing estrogen and carcinogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's almost an endless series, but the famous ones are ellagic acid and gallic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** So the background from which they've come has changed considerably. Now the industry is calling them yet another compound that can be marketed to people to help them in their quest for the antioxidant effect.

## The History of Vitamin E and PUFA

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E is the famous, oldest sold antioxidant supplement. When it was first discovered, it was called the "fertility vitamin" and was sold to increase virility and fertility. The Shute family in the 1930s found that it not only made infertile women more fertile, but they knew that these women with excess estrogen often suffered from blood clot diseases—venous clots, embolisms in the lung, and strokes. They found that Vitamin E not only made them fertile by antagonizing the estrogen, but it prevented the clotting problems. It showed very clearly its anti-clotting effect was part of its anti-estrogen effect.

During that same period, up to 1940, estrogen was known to intensify the effects of unsaturated fats in oxidizing. It catalyzed their conversion into age pigment by interacting with iron and unsaturated fat. So estrogen was an oxidant, clot former, anti-fertility substance, and pro-inflammatory.

As the oil industry began promoting their seed oils, first for animal fattening, they were adding it to lab chow for research animals. It turned out that the animals were suffering from degenerative brain diseases and testicular degeneration. Someone found that Vitamin E protected against the toxic effects of the unsaturated fats. This was a very sudden shift away from Vitamin E as the anti-estrogen, and it started being called the antioxidant protective against the breakdown of unsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you were saying they added iron to the animal's feed and then they stopped seeing the beneficial effects of the Vitamin E?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For several years they found that the supplemented feed no longer cured the brain degeneration. They found that the Vitamin E was being destroyed right in the product by the presence of iron. But the same thing happens in the organism. Vitamin E and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) are very interactive and pro-oxidative. The industries—both the estrogen industry and the seed oil industry—found that this was a way to distract the public from thinking of estrogen and unsaturated fats as being dangerous. If Vitamin E was just protecting against oxidation, then all you needed was fresh oil and Vitamin E. They suppressed the idea that Vitamin E was an anti-estrogen, anti-clot, heart-protecting drug for about 40 years.

## Vitamin C and Iron Interactions

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This made me think about prenatal vitamins. When a woman is exposed to much higher estrogen levels, prenatal vitamins have a large dose of iron and a large dose of Vitamin C. We were talking about how that gets destroyed with iron as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. That's analogous to something that happens inside the cell during stress. If you're overloaded with iron when your cell can't use oxygen properly, any reductant, including Vitamin C, will react to turn the highly oxidized iron into the partly reduced form—ferrous iron. In that case, that iron becomes a major oxidant, transferring its electron to fats, proteins, DNA, and so on.

About 10 years ago, a free radical researcher put some Vitamin C—he started with a 500 milligram commercial tablet dissolved in a liter of distilled water—and found it produced a terrible intensity of free radicals. He then got the purest reagent grade available, and the same thing happened. He analyzed it and found there were several heavy metals in it. Since he knew about iron's effect, he used just a very small trace of iron, not adding any of the other oxidants, and found that that amount of iron was enough to turn the commercial ascorbic acid into a powerful oxidant.

**Andrew Murray:** This obviously happens in people's bodies. Iron is prevalent in everybody's body and in foods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This chemist said, "Isn't it amazing that this amount of free radicals you would think would kill anything?" He said it shows what amazing defenses our stomachs and intestines must have to survive taking ascorbic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** In this country, there seemed to be a cultural trend towards mega-dosing—five grams or more of Vitamin C a day was not uncommon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Linus Pauling pointed out that a goat that weighs as much as a person would be producing about 4,000 milligrams of Vitamin C a day. I had been taking large amounts of Vitamin C and was reacting badly to it, having a cough and chronic symptoms. So I stopped taking it. After a while, I wondered how much Vitamin C I was putting out in my urine every day. On an ordinary diet at that time—including bread and potatoes, things you don't think of as having Vitamin C—I was still putting out 3,000 milligrams a day consistently.

That got me interested in where the Vitamin C was coming from. It turns out that meat, for example, is extremely rich in dehydroascorbic acid. That is not measured; they measure the reduced form, ordinary ascorbic acid, when they analyze foods. So they're simply not looking at the major form in food. Most foods have more ascorbic acid than the analysts show. It functions in the cell as an oxidant, and that's how it has a major part of its protective effect.

When something goes wrong with the oxidative system—if you have a temporary shut off of the blood supply—the electrons coming from fat, sugar, and protein being metabolized will essentially escape and do random damage. But the presence of the oxidative dehydroascorbate in the cell functions as a substitute for oxygen for a short time. It soaks up these random damaging electrons, being turned back into ordinary ascorbic acid, which then becomes water soluble and leaves the cell.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So there's a huge amount of this form of Vitamin C that plays an extremely important role in our physiology, but food analysts aren't even looking at this level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who don't eat a significant amount of bread, pasta, and beans will typically consume in their other foods—fruits, meats, milk—3,000 to 4,000 milligrams of Vitamin C equivalent a day.

## Caller: Milk and Osteoporosis

**Caller:** I have a question about milk. Dr. Peat, I know you are a proponent of milk drinking. I was increasing my milk drinking, and then I came across a paper titled "How Milk Causes Osteoporosis." It paralleled the high bone density of people in countries where they drink a lot of milk with correlated high rates of osteoporosis. Can you address that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is almost an organization of anti-milk people, and that's one of their worst publications. It is unscientific. Much of it is the lack of Vitamin D in those countries. If you compare someone in Vietnam who eats maybe 600 milligrams of calcium from vegetables, and someone in Sweden who might get 2,000 milligrams from milk and cheese, the people in Vietnam are outside a lot getting sunlight and Vitamin D. Their diet is rich in magnesium and other nutrients. Since milk production is high in the high-latitude countries, part of that effect is the lack of Vitamin D.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's a lack of Vitamin D in the northern hemisphere causing the osteoporosis, even amongst milk drinkers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Caller:** Is there any accuracy to their claim that we have a finite number of osteoblasts and we use them up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The osteoblasts are regenerating and being renewed. There is no finite population.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's not even normal medical science to say that there's a finite population. You're constantly breaking down bone and building bone. Also, bone mineral density scans don't look at the health of the bone or the protein structure; they just look at the minerals through an X-ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at a population that's similar in other ways, the difference between milk drinking and not milk drinking corresponds to strong bones versus weak or smaller bones. Animal experiments are the clearest way to understand medical issues. Whenever a medical doctrine chooses to sell a product that conflicts with animal studies, they say we can't go by anything except double-blind human clinical studies. But much of medicine is based on animal studies, and they are a perfectly valid way for most issues.

## Caller: Diabetes, Diet, and Beta Cell Regeneration

**Caller:** I am newly diagnosed with diabetes at age 67. Is a restricted calorie diet helpful? Also, I read an article in the *New York Times* titled "High Stress Can Make Insulin Cells Regress." It said beta cells in mice weren't dead but reverted to an earlier developmental state. I'm trying to control it with diet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cells can replace themselves in several different ways. Regressing and redifferentiating is one way, but a well-established way is that the alpha cells in the pancreas are converted steadily into beta cells. You can completely kill off all the beta cells by eating too much unsaturated fat and have supposedly Type 1 diabetes. But if you stop killing the beta cells, the alpha cells are known to be able to replenish them. The stimulus and the defense to keep the replacement going from the alpha cells is sugar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's just what diabetics avoid. For our listeners, unsaturated fats include all those vegetable oils that are liquid.

**Caller:** Yes, I've been omitting that and using coconut oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You've probably seen news about a hundred-year-old study where they used aspirin to cure diabetes. Aspirin helps you handle glucose fairly quickly to lower your blood glucose. Aspirin happens to be a very powerful antioxidant of a safe kind that prevents the excess electrons from things such as polyunsaturated fats destroying cells like the beta cells. So the aspirin is not only intensifying your ability to immediately use glucose, but it's also protecting against any residual polyunsaturated fats stored in your body.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you take more than one baby aspirin a day, you need to take one milligram (1,000 micrograms) of Vitamin K with each standard 325mg aspirin tablet to prevent bleeding issues.

**Caller:** What about restricted calorie diets? I heard about 600 calories a day giving the pancreas a rest.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the low-calorie diets were analyzed by a researcher named B.P. Yu. He found that if you simply reduced the polyunsaturated fats but kept the calories the same, you got the same protective effects as a very low-calorie intake. When you reduce your calories to the bare minimum, you burn the polyunsaturated fats for energy, and they don't get loose to do the damage.

**Caller:** So if you didn't have a lot of polyunsaturated fats in the first place, it wouldn't matter if you ate normal-sized meals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. People who have a high metabolic rate aren't hurt so much by the polyunsaturated fats because they burn them for energy. The PUFA inhibit your thyroid function and block your oxidative metabolism, allowing free radicals to get loose and damage things.

**Caller:** Thank you very much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In one of my articles, I mentioned studies done in Paris about 1860 where doctors cured diabetic patients by giving them as much sugar in their diet as they were losing in their urine. They described the recovery of patients on 10 to 12 ounces of sugar added to their diet every day. More recently, people have seen that fructose, in particular, maintains the cell in a state of low phosphate and intense oxidative energy and chelates iron. Iron is one of the major things that interacts with unsaturated fats to produce free radicals. Fructose keeps the cell oxidized, including keeping the iron from catching the electrons that make it toxic.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And white sugar is half fructose, half glucose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So the old-fashioned sugar diet was not only preventing tissue wasting, but it was having an antioxidant effect in the pancreas. The sugar was an essential factor for supporting the regeneration of the beta cells to produce insulin.

## Wasting Syndrome in Animals

**Engineer:** I have a 13-year-old dog who has a wasting syndrome. He's losing weight and is close to death. Should I try adding sugar to his dog food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I have a friend who has been feeding his dogs mostly meat. One of the dogs he put on a mostly milk diet, and it recovered from cataracts. Another dog he thought was about to die, so he put a tablespoon of sugar on each of its servings of meat, and it is recovering.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've seen great results recovering injured fowl—ducks and geese—with egg, milk, and sugar. It's a convalescent food.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vanilla also happens to be anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Before we move on, regarding Vitamin C supplements: Dr. Peat pointed out that companies can call a vitamin "food-based" even when they take cornstarch and oxidize it with lead to produce the Vitamin C. So if you're having allergic reactions, check your vitamins.

## Selenium, Thyroid, and Progesterone

**Andrew Murray:** How about other beneficial antioxidants? I know you mentioned selenium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Selenium activates the thyroid. By making the cell use oxygen and consuming all the potentially harmful electrons, the thyroid functions as an antioxidant. Even though its function is to increase oxidation, it prevents the random, harmful type of oxidative damage. Estrogen, by interfering with thyroid-activated functions, produces a lot of reductive stress to the cell, causes water uptake, and shifts the balance towards the reductants. It's like anti-Vitamin E in its effects. Progesterone opposes those effects, working with thyroid to keep the cell in its resting, oxidized state.

## Caller: Sugar and Aggression

**Caller:** I have a brother who is 10 years sober but consumes great quantities of Mountain Dew and ginger ale. By the evening, he's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde—very aggressive. I think the sugar is feeding it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, sugar and alcohol have almost exactly opposite effects on the cell. Fructose, in particular, is almost an absolute defense against the cellular damage done by ethyl alcohol.

**Caller:** But he gets reactive. It's almost like he's high.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea that sugar causes behavior issues has been around a long time. It got a big boost in the 50s with the publicity for fat-based damage to the circulatory system and the reaction that "no, it was the fructose, not the fat." One subdivision of that thought is that sugar is addictive and shifts brain transmitters. But those theories are often driven by ideology. For example, they say you need to raise serotonin for peace and tranquility and that sugar spoils that. But in dogs, aggressive ones have high serotonin, and if you lower it, they become peaceful.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It sounds like he might have other nutritional deficiencies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Magnesium deficiency often goes with having a reaction to a certain food simply because those drinks don't have any magnesium to speak of. When magnesium is low, your brain transmitters leak out and get out of balance. A magnesium supplement would be something for him to try.

## Conclusion: Vitamin E and Age Spots

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Before we wrap up, regarding Vitamin E: if people are going to supplement, especially if they are eating PUFA fats (pork, chicken, fish, vegetable oils), it is important to get a mixed tocopherol, not just the d-alpha tocopherol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The d-alpha was the antioxidant they promoted when they suppressed the information about the complete Vitamin E, which related to preventing clots, tumors, and estrogen symptoms.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So a Vitamin E supplement might be safe, but a Vitamin C supplement definitely isn't?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. You can get as much Vitamin C as your body can use just from foods.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned lipofuscin, or age pigment, is a product of free radical damage and low thyroid. Is that a good gauge of how much stress someone is under cellularly if they have a lot of age spots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, definitely. If you can see them on the skin, you're getting them in your brain and other organs. It is dietary. If they're fairly new, Vitamin E, progesterone, and even a tiny bit of vodka can help to remove them.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Peat. For listeners, Dr. Raymond Peat's website is www.raypeat.com. There are many fully referenced scientific articles there. Thanks for listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*.
