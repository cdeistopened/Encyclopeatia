## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville. From 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions related to this month's topic of iron and its dangers. Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us again. Good evening, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good evening.

**Andrew Murray:** When the subject of iron was suggested as a topic, I started looking at articles from PubMed and the National Institutes of Health. I wanted to preface the show with something I've written to let people know clearly where the show content is going and where the evidence is coming from.

We know you've written several newsletters and articles related to the dangers of iron. It seems pertinent to the science surrounding the inflammatory nature of COVID, especially surrounding the fatalities in people receiving the experimental drug due to thromboembolic processes. This is added to the acute and chronic inflammatory processes stimulated by receiving this drug, which is related to the "smoking gun" of potential autoimmune disease in populations receiving it.

Tonight, we'll be discussing the link between iron, estrogen, and the suppression of peptides like cathelicidin and hepcidin. We will discuss the experimental drug for COVID-19 and the rising numbers of deaths reported to VAERS. With this in mind, and our thoughts firmly established in science, we're pleased to welcome Dr. Peat to discuss the physiology of inflammation and its relationship to COVID-19.

Dr. Peat, regarding the serious outcomes of COVID—people on ventilators or those who have died—could you discuss the physiology of this process? Let's put some science to the mechanism of inflammation and look for a strategic solution.

## The Physiology of Iron and Inflammation

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are lots of ways that iron triggers inflammation, but probably the best way to start thinking about it is that inflammation triggers the excessive uptake and retention of iron.

The inflammation very often affects hepcidin. Hepcidin is a germicidal peptide that also regulates iron. Its function in the whole organism is to suppress the absorption of iron. So, when you have enough iron, you increase your hepcidin, which is a virucidal, bactericidal, protective peptide, and it blocks the absorption of iron.

One of the effects of inflammation is to increase the absorption and retention of iron. When it's extreme, it ends up damaging cells, such as the red blood cells. When they break down under stress—for example, when you're stressed by anything—you tend to release free fatty acids into your bloodstream. Too many free fatty acids activate destabilizing things that tend to dissolve your red cells and activate lipid peroxidation.

So, under stress, the lifespan of your red blood cells is shorter, meaning that they are increasing your iron burden—the free, dangerous, uncontrolled iron.

Another effect of inflammation is that it increases the enzyme heme oxygenase. This enzyme breaks down the heme group. When your red blood cells have leaked hemoglobin, the heme itself is a very dangerous "wild catalyst," leading to lipid peroxidation, among other things. It has to be disposed of. But in breaking down heme, this heme oxygenase enzyme liberates bilirubin (the chemical involved in jaundice), creates a molecule of carbon monoxide, and liberates a free atom of iron.

Chronic stress is constantly making you dispose of these heme groups—they are very dangerous, especially in the brain. The stress-induced heme oxygenase is constantly dropping these random iron atoms, along with carbon monoxide and bilirubin. This is probably one of the major factors in iron overload. It's an internal process involving the breaking down of red cells and other cells under stress.

At the same time, the lowered hepcidin under stress is leading you to retain more of the iron out of your food. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukins, and prostaglandins—like prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor—activate aromatase, producing estrogen. So, estrogen goes up in inflammation. Under the influence of high estrogen, a woman will retain several times as much of the iron in her food as a man does who isn't under stress.

There are several major vicious circles that lead to the production of inflammation, which leads to heme oxygenase, which leads to estrogen, which leads to more inflammation and iron.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And this is something that can be easily tested on a blood test, right? You can look at the iron saturation on a blood test?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the transferrin saturation percentage is probably the most useful thing. That indicates how loaded the transferrin molecule is.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you can test the quantity of transferrin as well.

## Ferritin, COVID Outcomes, and Chelation

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an article from the NIH related to COVID outcomes in patients with severe infection. They found a statistical correlation between high ferritin levels and poor outcomes. They were suggesting iron chelation as a strategy to mitigate serious outcomes. What do you have to say about ferritin levels or chelation for known high ferritin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several people have been talking about protecting against disease, and now especially against the coronavirus, by chelating iron. Going back decades, people have realized that free iron is associated with all kinds of infections—parasites, fungus, bacteria, viruses—and with cancer. Cancer acts like an invading pathogen in its hunger for iron. Things that want to grow fast need a supply of generously available iron.

If your cells are overloaded with bound iron, any local irritation can make those cells release the iron and become a target for cancer or viruses. Ferritin should basically be an intracellular storage form that's invisible to anything in the blood. But as you start getting stressed and overloaded, it starts leaking out of the cells. Especially any cells that are stressed and injured will tend to leak their ferritin.

Just looking at your blood level, you can't really tell what your stored iron is because inflammation makes the iron leak out of your cells. The transferrin and ferritin in your blood are both increased. So as you are experiencing inflammation, your blood iron rises apart from what the real level inside your cells is.

**Andrew Murray:** What about diagnosing deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several people over the years have said that the only certain way to diagnose iron overload or deficiency is to biopsy bone marrow or liver. Very often, when you seem to be deficient by what's floating around in your blood, you'll have more than a normal amount in your bone marrow and liver.

However, practically speaking, if your circulating iron level on transferrin and ferritin are extremely small—approaching one-hundredth of a healthy level—then you can make a fairly good guess that you are deficient.

Fifty years ago, doctors would get furious when I talked about this because they were still diagnosing iron deficiency on the basis of low hemoglobin and hematocrit. They were prescribing iron to a very high proportion of their female patients. It was an Anglo-American custom going back to the 19th century regarding "chlorosis," or the "green sickness" that only young women had.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Was that from too much iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was the diagnosis. Because their blood was low in hemoglobin and hematocrit, they said it was the weakness typical of young women that made them look green. The green was a combination of poorly oxygenated blood giving them a blue tint, combined with bilirubin. The mixture of yellow and blue commonly made young women greenish.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the estrogen was high and the blood wasn't oxygenated, so their liver wasn't excreting the bilirubin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably sluggish liver and low thyroid being unable to get rid of the bilirubin at a normal rate. Arsenic was commonly used to treat it because irritation—such as arsenic produces—stimulates your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. In the 1920s, when the idea of chlorosis treated by arsenic was finally discarded, they kept up the same process: stimulating the bone marrow to make more red cells simply on the basis of low hemoglobin, using high doses of iron. Sometimes amazingly horrible doses of intravenous or intramuscular iron.

**Andrew Murray:** Probably causing massive damage and inflammation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I knew women who had black marks all over their legs from injected iron. In the 70s, doctors were powerfully offended by talking about the dangers of iron overload, but over the last few decades, that practice has gradually weakened.

**Andrew Murray:** I know someone with a ferritin of 800, which is twice the upper limit. What would you think about iron chelators for that person?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago, I was interested in deferoxamine. Just about the time I was starting to think about using it, I read that it could move the iron into worse places and lead to cancer. So I'm a little skeptical about what kind of chelator they use.

**Andrew Murray:** So it wouldn't bind it up for excretion; it would basically shunt it somewhere else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens with a lot of chelation. When they think they're chelating out mercury, they will often be putting it somewhere else—taking mercury, lead, and cadmium out of your bone where it was sitting passively and moving it into your kidneys and brain.

## Coffee as a Safe Chelator

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know of any safe chelators?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee is the only one I feel safe with. It has been shown to reduce the bound heavy metals in kidneys and other crucial organs, especially the liver. Many studies show that coffee drinkers have low ALT, which is an indicator of liver stress. Heavy coffee drinkers have an extremely low incidence of all kinds of liver diseases, including liver cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Could someone who was never a coffee drinker take capsules of caffeine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't just the caffeine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Haven't you said, Dr. Peat, that calcium and eggshell is a good chelator of heavy metals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in a very indirect way. When you analyze the minerals in arteries, kidneys, and brains where they shouldn't be—where you shouldn't have calcium crystals—it turns out they've been seeing iron and other heavy metals associated with them. Part of the calcium crystal consists of iron.

Looking back historically, this association occurred in calcium-deficient areas. If there happened to be a lot of aluminum or other heavy metals instead of calcium in that area, their degenerating brains, kidneys, and arteries would contain a lot of that other metal.

For a long time, they thought aluminum explained Alzheimer's disease. But it turns out that when you're deficient in calcium, you load up on whatever "junk metal" happens to be around. The reason is that a stressed tissue shifts from oxidative metabolism (producing carbon dioxide) over to glycolytic production of lactic acid. When a cell produces lactic acid, it leaves a slightly alkaline shift inside the cell, ionizing the cells and making them more able to retain calcium, iron, and aluminum.

## Dietary Sources of Iron

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What foods would you consider the highest in iron that should be limited?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It matters how much calcium they have, too. If you're not getting enough calcium to turn off your parathyroid hormone and keep your metabolism towards carbon dioxide, then you're going to retain more of the iron.

Meat, and liver in particular, have very low calcium content and very high iron content. It's extremely important to have coffee when you're eating those to block the iron absorption.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned parathyroid hormone. This would be a probable indicator of chronic inflammatory processes, potentially like cancers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Vitamin D helps to avoid iron retention even though it's acting through calcium and parathyroid hormone. By lowering parathyroid hormone, it's lowering your affinity for iron and other heavy metals.

## Caller Questions

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line.

**Caller 1:** I'm calling from Harris. Would fulvic minerals be good for binding?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they would probably hold it in your intestine to some extent, the way they bind minerals in the soil.

**Caller 1:** So if you ate contaminated food, it might hold it, but it wouldn't necessarily pull it out of the rest of your body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen research on that, but that's a possibility. It would have to be tested because if you have a lot of stomach acid, the acid might release minerals associated with what you took in.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I know it's not a good idea to eat clay regularly because it has a lot of iron in it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, when it hits your stomach, there's a slight dissolution of the clay substance.

**Andrew Murray:** So, Dr. Peat, to wrap that up: you don't recommend chelators because they pull metals out of safe stores and put them into circulation where they cause damage. But coffee has an excretory ability?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Also, when we make acids like citric acid or succinic acid inside our cells—if we make enough that some of it moves into the bloodstream—that's known to carry aluminum and iron out of your cell into the bloodstream. But if you *eat* those acids, they will pick up heavy metals in your intestine and carry them *into* your body. As they are degraded by oxidation, they can drop their load of heavy metals in your cells. Our body creates a stream of chelators which are constantly tending to pull cadmium and aluminum out of the body.

**Andrew Murray:** Would it be okay if someone took capsules of ground coffee or instant coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Capsules of instant coffee, for example.

## Hematocrit vs. Iron Overload

**Caller 2:** I'm calling on behalf of my husband. We are regular blood donors. In the last year, he has failed the hematocrit test consistently at the blood center, where they take it out of the fingertip. But when he does lab work out of his elbow, it's fine. Do you have suggestions? Maybe drink less coffee before he gives blood?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Capillary hematocrit is not the same as arterial or general system hematocrit. You have to figure out what's going on with the difference between the two.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there anything else you'd add to that low hematocrit and issues with retaining iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's important to look at other things than hematocrit. If you're under stress and have an elevated estrogen-to-progesterone ratio, estrogen lowers hepcidin. If your estrogen is up, you're retaining iron at the same time that you're lowering your hematocrit. It's the same thing that was happening 100 years ago—women looked anemic, but they were getting poisoned with too much iron. That can happen to men, too.

## Supplements for Iron Detox

**Caller 3:** I'm from New Mexico. Can niacinamide, aspirin, or lithium detox iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin is known to be very protective against iron. That was established 30 or 40 years ago. They think it might be acting as an antioxidant and maybe as an iron binder in some way. It is probably one of the most protective things, next to coffee and Vitamin E, for preventing the toxicity of iron.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about niacinamide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does all kinds of defensive things to maintain your cell's oxidative capacity. It's the failure of oxidative energy production that makes iron become so toxic. So I would say that niacinamide and aspirin are extremely good bets for being protective.

**Andrew Murray:** What about lithium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it can have some adverse effects on your iron system.

## Chelation Risks

**Caller 4:** Is chelation bad then or good?

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat explained that most chelation tends to pull it out of safe stores and put it into circulation or soft tissues where it does damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of these recent articles on using chelation against COVID are using very particular chelation substances, such as lactoferrin.

**Caller 4:** My doctor has me on chelated medicines. I have extreme inflammation. Would that contribute to me having so much inflammation?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is your doctor a naturopath or an MD? Are you talking about chelated vitamins?

**Caller 4:** Yeah, not just vitamins. I'm on methylfolate and complexes. I can't take pharmaceuticals; they make me deathly sick.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's just a marketing ploy. The way vitamins and minerals exist in food is the safest. If you associate them with other chemicals, there just haven't been enough studies to know whether they're safe and effective compared to getting them naturally from foods. I've seen lots of chronic, mysterious ailments clear up as soon as the person stopped all of their supplements for a week or so.

## Vaccine Reactions and Blood Sludging

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about live blood analysis. I've seen doctors talking about the inflammatory effects of the drug being used for COVID and the formation of "rouleaux," where the red cells stack up on each other.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you remember a long time ago there was interest in what they called "blood sludging"? They could demonstrate it looking at the white of a person's eye with a microscope.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this caller first.

**Caller 5:** I ended up getting the COVID shot 10 days ago. I have Lyme disease. On the eighth day, my arm blew up like a balloon, got hot, and had a rash. Now my fingers and toes look like the blood is pooling at the ends, and my hands are super blotchy. Is that inflammation of the vascular system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The vaccine creates inflammation. The most dangerous part is that this type of inflammation produces a tendency toward hypercoagulation. When you have areas that aren't circulating fully, there is a tendency to form fibrin layers—clotting material—inside the blood vessel. That exactly relates to the blood sludging thing we were just starting to talk about.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What would you recommend she use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory things that are successful for treating COVID patients, as Dr. Peter McCullough has talked about, help for the symptoms of the vaccine damage. Aspirin, cyproheptadine, milk, and Vitamin D. Serotonin is one of the things that goes crazy under the inflammation of both COVID and the vaccine.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, could you sum up the rouleaux formation seen in blood after the vaccine and how that relates to coagulopathies and sudden strokes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Melvin Knisely was a person who studied the blood sludging phenomenon in people who were under stress and deteriorating quickly. He saw it as simply a lack of metabolic energy. But people following up on his work emphasized that what was happening was catalyzing fibrin polymerization and creating a layer—a blockade film of fibrin—inside your blood vessels. This thickens the wall of the capillary, making it hard for nutrients and oxygen to get through, and coats red blood cells with a layer of fibrin.

People working with very good microscopes later studied these coin-like rolls of red blood cells (rouleaux). With microprobes, they would pull them apart under the microscope, and they would snap back together. They published images showing filaments of fibrin polymers stretched between the red blood cells, like rubber bands pulling them back together. That was brought on basically by a reduction in oxidative metabolism, shifting to lactic acid metabolism. That's where you start having the iron problems and inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people's blood could be clumping like that just under a stressful situation, not necessarily just from COVID or shots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's an apparently universal thing that happens when you're in very bad condition.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So let's all not be stressed. Take your Vitamin D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stop the inflammation, stop the clotting, get your energy restored.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat. For those who want to listen later, Dr. Peat's information is raypeat.com. We can be reached at westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You can email us at sarah@westernbotanicalmedicine.com. I also wanted to mention regarding aspirin: It's only safe to use more than a baby aspirin a day if you're taking Vitamin K. Thorne Research makes a great Vitamin K2. You take 1,000 micrograms (1 milligram) per drop. For every aspirin you take, you need one drop of Vitamin K2 to keep yourself from bleeding excessively.

**Andrew Murray:** Could you mention natural food sources of K2?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Kale has Vitamin K2, but not in high enough doses if you want to use aspirin to block inflammation in doses of 1 to 3 grams a day. A regular tablet is 325mg; a baby aspirin is 90mg. If you take just that, you don't need the K2 supplement. But if you want to use larger doses, it's not safe unless you have a high dose of Vitamin K2.

**Andrew Murray:** Until next month, let's move forward and look at the science, not the fiction. Good night.
