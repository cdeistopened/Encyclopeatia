## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's March 19, 2021 edition of *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** Once again we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat to bring his expertise to bear on the topic. This month is a continuing topic regarding the current coronavirus pandemic, the science behind some of the facts, and some of the alternatives. Specifically, the rollout of the coronavirus vaccines and the potential implications discussed by professionals and scientists around the world. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

## The Risk of Viral Immune Escape

**Andrew Murray:** We’ve spent a while discussing the pandemic's effects, the death figures versus infection numbers, and the CDC admitting numbers have been conflated. Recently, I saw an article by a Belgian virologist, Geert Vanden Bossche. He has a long professional background with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and companies producing vaccines. 

He argues, similar to Dr. Simone Gold, that for a 99.6% survivable infection, this experimental drug should be the last thing considered. Vanden Bossche suggests that because of the mechanism of the drug, there is a potential for new variants to emerge under selective pressure because of the specific antibodies targeting the virus. He argues that natural killer cells are a far better way to deal with this. Is this a "leaky vaccine" situation? What do you make of his discussion on viral immune escape?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** His point about the mutating virus escaping from a vaccine the way it's being used is good standard opinion. What people can justly disagree on is the risk. He gets very excited thinking the risk is very high. If you aren't convinced that the present virus is so very deadly, then an increase of virulence might not be so dangerous as he is suggesting. It's a possibility, but I personally don't think it compares to other ongoing threats, like the risk of world war breaking out. I think the idea of the vaccine causing a worsening epidemic is a moderate to small risk.

However, another very important point he makes is regarding the vaccine creating a very powerful antibody reaction to knock out one particular pathogen. It is effective for blocking the development of that pathogen, but you've devoted your immune system to reacting to that one very specialized problem. Meanwhile, there is an infinite number of potential immunological dangers in the world. Anytime you suffer an infection or a vaccination that causes a very powerful production of one single type of antibody, you're diverting resources from the ability to respond to that infinite number of immune challenges.

## Natural Killer Cells vs. Antibodies

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He emphasizes natural killer cells. These exist in any healthy organism. Within about three days of a viral infection, they will go to work to kill the cells damaged by the virus. They don't give their attention to killing a virus, but to getting rid of the cells that are being used to multiply the virus. That's why 99.6% of people not only survive, but most don't even know they're sick. At the very earliest stage, the natural killer cells are knocking out the cells that would be multiplying the virus.

He proposes a different kind of vaccine to improve natural killer cell functions. However, it turns out that all the treatments active against COVID-19—the drugs helpful in reducing mortality—have had very significant anti-inflammatory effects. From the very first, the Chinese noticed that an anti-serotonin drug, cinanserin, prevented the development of the infection. Since then, several antihistamines, natural flavonoids from fruits and vegetables, progesterone, and angiotensin receptor blockers have been found effective.

If you look at the natural killer cell, it knocks out the host cell which gets inflamed. Being inflamed makes it a factory for making more viruses. It's the inflammation which is knocked out at the very beginning. Vitamin D, for example, is a great anti-inflammatory agent that stops the COVID infection, largely through improving the action of natural killer cells.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Are you saying that when you have one of these vaccines, it causes your immune system to be highly specialized in dealing with the spike protein, and it fails to promote natural killer cell formation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not only the natural killer cells, but every other level. We normally have a bunch of antibodies which have an overlapping activity against anything you want to put into the bloodstream. These natural antibodies are just part of our basic defense system. The power of your body to manufacture proteins naturally is limited. When the immune system is swamped by a single antigen and the antibodies for it, it sends waves through the antibody-producing system and directs the attention towards that one antigen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you could become more susceptible to other infections?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There were several studies in recent years looking at the after-effects of the flu vaccine. They found that vaccinated people had a much greater rate of coronavirus infections the following year—not necessarily this particular one, but coronaviruses in general. It's well established that immunity to one thing makes you more susceptible to infection with other things. 

I talked about immunology at the University of Veracruz 40 years ago, and at that time, it was already a current topic that antibodies are a very touchy thing to mess with. The theory of immunity and resistance has been going through a paradigm shift for the last 10 or 15 years, but the official science establishment is acting as if this isn't happening.

## Autoimmunity and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Simone Gold mentioned antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and predicted a rise in autoimmunity in the coming years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's an established thing that specialized antibodies increase your risk not only for every other kind of infection but for general inflammatory disease and autoimmunity. There is now an autoimmune disease epidemic going on that corresponds very closely to the huge expansion of the use of vaccines around 1980.

The nature of the immune system has been described to suit the doctrine of antibodies and germ-specific treatment. It goes back about 100 years, following Paul Ehrlich's "magic bullet" concept—the idea that every disease has a very specific poison or antibody to attack it. There never was a real magic bullet of a chemical nature, but this idea dominated the concept of natural immunity.

**Andrew Murray:** You’ve mentioned before that estrogen is extremely inflammatory and confers cancerous risk. You also mentioned that estrogen itself is connected to autoimmunity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. One of the first pro-inflammatory effects understood for estrogen was miscarriage. Estrogen creates an inflammatory state in the uterus leading to the death of the embryo. Progesterone's anti-inflammatory effect protects against miscarriage. 

The effect of estrogen is to increase the B cells—the cells that manufacture antibodies—and to increase inflammatory signals. The more estrogen dominance there is, the more B cells tend to overproduce their antibodies. This leads to autoimmune diseases, which are also just variants of the natural aging process. Many people are now referring to "inflammaging." The paradigm shift is realizing that inflammation is not part of the normal healthy immune process; it's part of a deranged or weakened immune system.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So children have such a healthy immune system with so many natural killer cells that they kill the cells breeding the virus without symptoms, whereas the elderly have fewer natural killer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A Vitamin D deficiency or an estrogen excess lowers the function of the natural killer cells.

## Vaccine Efficacy and Variants

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding variants, there is the South American P1 variant and the South African variant. They are saying these variants reduce the effectiveness of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Do you think there is a reasonable expectation that a dangerous variant could emerge because of the pressure from the experimental drugs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's always a valid possibility; other viruses have escaped vaccines and become a little more virulent. But regarding COVID-19 itself, its danger has been publicized without revealing the evidence for it. People are suing state and federal health departments asking them to reveal the evidence justifying disruptive policies like lockdowns and vaccination. They are refusing to deliver that evidence.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I saw an article today that said COVID is spiking in over a dozen states, most with high vaccination rates.

**Andrew Murray:** I also saw reports stating, "Don't be surprised when vaccinated people get infected." They say this is entirely expected.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drug companies are saying it's all coincidence. Hundreds of people are dying right after getting vaccinated, or becoming paralyzed or fainting, and they say that's within the realm of chance. But when you compare the number of deaths between two different vaccines—I think it was Pfizer compared to AstraZeneca—there was a significantly greater mortality among the Pfizer product.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And 20 countries in Europe have banned AstraZeneca because of blood clots.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's an obvious thing to do. I think anticipation of danger is why Merck decided not to come out with a vaccine, even though Pfizer says their vaccine is now the second most profitable drug in history. Merck felt the need for caution in going into something that could kill millions of people.

## Treatments and Long Haulers

**Andrew Murray:** What treatments would you suggest? We've mentioned Baical skullcap, pleurisy root, and elderberry.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** From an herbal perspective, licorice is like the herbal equivalent of steroids to quell inflammation. Thyme is also very anti-inflammatory and helps expectorate mucus. Dr. Peat, are there other agents?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Zinc-rich foods are a basic defense mechanism. Adequate Vitamin A is also important; studies show supplementing Vitamin A reduced a wide range of diseases. Generally, broad-spectrum, well-balanced nutrition will increase your general health and resistance.

**Caller (Whitethorn):** I’m curious if the doctor has recommendations for "long haulers," specifically regarding the loss of smell (anosmia) that hasn't come back.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Zinc is one of the essential factors for the olfactory and taste nerves, possibly because it's involved in the carbonic anhydrase enzyme. That enzyme regulates the production of carbon dioxide versus bicarbonate, which is a major anti-inflammatory factor. The anti-inflammatory effects of zinc are largely working through the metabolism of carbon dioxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Oysters, mussels, and clams are quite a rich source of zinc.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw a study showing a correlation between low zinc levels and hepatitis infection. Do you think the mechanism for reversing anosmia with zinc is based on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very possibly.

## Natural Killer Cell Vaccines & Shedding

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about natural killer cell-based vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vanden Bossche was working on a vaccine for chickens. It seems like a possibility. But I think the general approach should be things that increase your ability to retain carbon dioxide. Zinc is part of that enzyme reaction, but calcium channel blockers, which showed real benefits in treating COVID patients, also happen to increase carbon dioxide retention ability.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you know someone who has had the shot, is there a risk for the unvaccinated person to be around them? Does it differ between the mRNA and the attenuated virus vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think continuing to be conscious of washing your hands is good, but I don't think that's a real serious risk to catch something from the vaccinated person. However, other vaccines have turned out to create a vaccine-related epidemic. Currently in Africa, polio entirely dependent on the vaccine is now the main epidemic concern. So there is precedent for the vaccine itself to cause and spread disease.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I guess it's good advice for people that have had the vaccine to continue wearing their masks to minimize the chance of spreading anything.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Since they have participated in a completely unknown experiment, and they are the experimental guinea pigs, they should volunteer to wear the mask.

## Pollution and Natural Antivirals

**Caller (David from SF):** I think mismanaging this epidemic has to do with a land grab. But I wanted to ask: Since this is a new disease, do you think it has its origins in pollution? Wuhan is one of the most polluted cities. Also, is there any natural critter or food that will consume a virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are good publications showing that the inflammation caused by air pollution does make you much more susceptible to viral infections. As for destroying the virus, sunlight—specifically ultraviolet light—destroys it fairly quickly.

**Caller (David from SF):** I’ve used cheap pot smoke to induce coughing and clear my lungs during bronchitis. I wonder if there is a symptomatic way of getting rid of it, like dust or ash in the lungs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Speaking of herbs, emodin, which is the active ingredient in Chinese rhubarb and cascara sagrada, specifically blocks the coronavirus spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Besides being anti-inflammatory and restorative of mitochondrial respiration, it has specific antiviral activity.

**Andrew Murray:** Would the therapeutic dose cause purging effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The sensitivity varies. But if you're going to treat something deadly, like advanced kidney failure—where kidneys are improved by emodin—I don't think anyone worries about a little laxative action.

## Adverse Reaction Mitigation

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For people having adverse effects to the first shot of the mRNA vaccine, what would you recommend to help mitigate those effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing is to make sure their blood sugar doesn't fall. Falling blood sugar is the most powerful pro-inflammatory thing possible. Any little allergen can become deadly when your blood sugar is very low. Raising the blood sugar quiets the immune inflammatory reactions. Baking soda, providing both bicarbonate (carbon dioxide) and sodium, is another quick-acting anti-inflammatory.
