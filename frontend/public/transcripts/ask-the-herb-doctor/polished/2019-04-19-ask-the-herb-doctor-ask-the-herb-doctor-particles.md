## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. We are going to discuss antiviral herbs, nanoparticles and their negative health effects, and articles surrounding polyunsaturated fats and cancer incidence. The tide is slowly turning, and as Dr. Peat has been famously quoted in the past, "A lie gets around the world quicker than truth can tie up her shoelaces." We are very welcome to have Dr. Peat join us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hello.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to start with a brief introduction to the things we're going to cover, following up on the last couple of months regarding the antiviral activity of selected medicinal plants. If you look at PubMed, you can find clinical trials on plants for specific viruses. While we know information sources may not always be fully accurate, PubMed and ResearchGate are some of the few avenues we have to look for results. I know I've interviewed you, Dr. Peat, and you have pointed out blatant errors in research before. Could you introduce yourself and outline your academic background for those who haven't heard of you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Between 1968 and 1972, I studied biology, emphasizing physiology—especially reproductive physiology—at the University of Oregon. I didn't start the academic study of biology until I had about 20 years of investigating controversies in biology. I had decided that academic biology, especially in the US, was too dogmatic and commercial to really be scientific. I finally decided to go through the academic process to find out some of its weaknesses. After getting the PhD, I continued my independent studying, doing nutrition and hormone counseling, and studying how the brain, reproductive, and immune systems interact with the environment, especially nutrition.

## Polyunsaturated Fats vs. Saturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** You've been a big proponent of getting people to stop using polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), quoting Burr and others from the 1930s and 40s. You've mentioned that the paint industry was a big user of these vegetable oils. When the petroleum industry began manufacturing synthetic additives and paints, it put seed oil producers at risk, so they decided to put these oils into the food chain. Growing up in the 70s, margarine and sunflower oil were advertised as heart-healthy, while natural products like saturated animal fats were demonized.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A large study in veterans on the "heart-healthy" diet with margarine found that it not only caused more cancer but also increased deaths from heart disease. That was a turning point against the original "essential fatty acids" and set the background for fish oil to come on the market.

**Andrew Murray:** I came across an article titled "Are Diets high in Omega 6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids unhealthy?" from the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem. It stated that Israel has one of the highest dietary PUFA-to-saturated fat ratios in the world, consuming 8% more Omega-6 than the USA. Despite this, there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and increased cancer incidence. The study suggests high linoleic acid consumption might aggravate hyperinsulinemia and act as a substrate for lipid peroxidation. What do you think of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Andrew Murray:** It is difficult to find evidence for the opposite view because the industry pushes the pro-polyunsaturated side so strongly.

## Antiviral Herbs and Cell Stability

**Andrew Murray:** You've talked about naringenin before as an antioxidant. Do you have an explanation for naringenin's potential antiviral effects, specifically regarding herpes simplex?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it works the same way aspirin, progesterone, and all the cell stabilizers work. It increases the oxidative balance of the cell, simply reinforcing the effect of the oxidative respiratory metabolism. That makes the cell able to resist improper excitation and stabilizes it against random irritation. Just about anything that is unphysiological will destabilize the cell in the same direction. These things protect against viruses, radiation, vibration, oxygen deprivation, sugar deprivation, too much polyunsaturated fat, too much phosphate, or too little calcium. Anything that shifts the balance towards meaningless excitation or reducing proper energy production.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is a cell-stabilizing component that has an antiviral effect because it saves energy rather than allowing the cell to become excitedly toxic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When the virus wants to replicate, it excites the cell and gets the cell churning its mechanism. That damages the organism and produces more viruses.

**Andrew Murray:** I also wanted to mention pomegranate. I found an article mentioning the effect of zinc in conjunction with pomegranate rind extract being eight times greater in its viricidal activity than pomegranate extract alone. Do you have anything to say on zinc?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the protein-synthesizing function of zinc is like vitamin A for accelerating healing.

## Skin Cancer and Betulinic Acid

**Andrew Murray:** I read an article from a university in Romania regarding birch bark extract. Betulin and betulinic acid showed good results in treating melanomas, colon, and cervical cancer. The study suggested the extract interfered with angiogenesis (the creation of new blood vessels).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Structurally, betulinic acid is analogous to progesterone. Sarsaparilla has a similar steroid.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding skin cancers, I’ve used a product from Australia called Curiderm, based on the plant *Solanum sodomaeum* (related to eggplant), which contains solasodine glycosides. It targets cancer cells while leaving normal cells intact. I also used 7% iodine on some sun-damaged lesions on my arm, and they disappeared after about 60 days. Dr. Peat, regarding melanoma, do you view it outside of the regular "sunburn causing genetic changes" approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For melanoma, sun really isn't the main factor. Most melanomas occur in areas that aren't much exposed to the sun, like the back, inside of the thighs, or even the bottom of the feet. It's a very hormone-sensitive thing. Estrogen has been suspected for a long time of being involved. I've seen dozens of apparent melanomas that disappeared. A couple of people who were diagnosed with terminal, metastatic melanoma saw it regress when they changed their diet and used coffee, aspirin, various nutritional things, vitamin D, and a lot of orange juice and milk.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this an anti-estrogenic approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. So far, all of the melanoma people I've talked to have had a really quick response from changing their diet.

**Andrew Murray:** Have you seen people treated effectively without medical intervention for basal or squamous cell carcinomas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The first one I saw was a man about 80 years old, 45 years ago. He put progesterone on his diagnosed lip cancer, and in a week or so, it was gone.

## Nanotechnology and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Nanotechnology is a rapidly progressing science found in many products, from skin creams to foods. What is your opinion on nanotechnology and where it is heading?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have recognized that particles like soot spontaneously make these highly structured, ultra-microscopic particles. About 35 years ago, the chemical industry sent me samples of their products. One was fumed silica, which floated out like smoke when I opened it. It is now added to toothpaste and foods to make things like salad dressing seem creamy. It worried me that the stuff floats right into the air and is dangerous to be around.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned soot, which reminds me of the chimney sweeps in the late 1800s getting testicular cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and soot contains estrogenic as well as carcinogenic chemicals. But the particles themselves, because of their shape and size, cause issues. The reason asbestos is carcinogenic is its fine, pointed crystalline structure. If a particle is as small as the point of an asbestos crystal, the body interprets it similarly to a virus. It starts an inflammatory process when the particle has a certain fineness or length-to-diameter ratio. A sharp or very small particle activates the inflammatory process, exciting the cell. If you have biological energy, you can tamp down that excitation. But when it becomes too frequent or intense, or your energy level decreases, the balance shifts towards inflammation, degeneration, and the production of fibrous tissues rather than functional tissues.

**Andrew Murray:** I found an article from the National University of Singapore describing "nanomaterial induced endothelial leakiness" (NanoEL). It said nanoparticles created gaps in the endothelium large enough for cancer cells to escape the circulatory system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most places talk about gaps between cells, but that leakiness is really a basic thing that excess excitation or energy deficiency causes in all cells. The substance of the cell leaks out. In a hypothyroid person, if you exercise a muscle too much, it leaks enzymes right through the surface of the cell. Just giving the cell glucose to get its energy up can stop that leakiness. Interestingly, someone looked at the fluid outside the cells in a tumor and found there was a thousand times more ATP in the fluid of a tumor than in normal tissues. The cells are leaky and losing their necessary materials so fast that they are constantly in this over-stimulated condition.

## Caller: Curiderm for Skin Lesions

**Caller:** I'm from Redway. Would you please go over the information about the Australian herbal topical cream for keratosis once again?

**Andrew Murray:** The product is called Curiderm—C-U-R-A-D-E-R-M. It is trademarked and patented. You can find it online; there are several outlets.

**Caller:** Thank you very much.

## Caller: Parkinson’s Disease

**Caller:** I'm in Eureka. I have questions about Parkinson's and a good direction to take with that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping testosterone and related steroids up is important. The neurosteroids are very protective. Testosterone has been identified as one thing that goes down in relation to Parkinson's. Pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone are all nerve-protective and restorative. Vitamin D is another steroid that is extremely protective to nerve cells.

**Caller:** How much Vitamin D should I take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You should also reduce phosphate in the diet along with pro-inflammatory fatty acids. Eat more carbohydrate and sugar, and any good source of calcium and magnesium like milk, cheese, and well-cooked green vegetables. Eat less beans, nuts, and meat because of their very high phosphate content.

**Andrew Murray:** To summarize: Testosterone is first and foremost. For males, lightweight bearing exercise is the best way to improve general testosterone. Avoid estrogenic substances like polyunsaturates (nuts, beans, seeds) and plastics. Use thyroid hormone if you are low thyroid, and aspirin is a good anti-inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And fibrous foods, because they help to reduce the reabsorption of estrogen in the intestine. Parkinson's almost always involves sluggish intestinal movement or constipation.

## Caller: Peripheral Neuropathy and Thyroid

**Caller:** I'm dealing with peripheral neuropathy in my feet caused by chemotherapy. It is incredibly painful. Could you suggest anything to mitigate the inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For nerve regeneration, peripheral as well as central, many animal studies show that vitamin D and progesterone work together to restore nerves. It is a good idea to have a blood test for both. Keep vitamin D in the middle of the normal range (50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter). Progesterone should be in the luteal range; even for a postmenopausal woman, it is good to supplement if it isn't naturally detectable.

**Andrew Murray:** This is because it directly opposes estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. After menopause, estrogen begins forming inside cells all through the body—fat cells, skin cells, breast, and uterine cells. It can be formed from adrenal precursors. Anti-inflammatory things like aspirin, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium all help minimize that inflammatory process of spontaneously forming estrogen in the tissues.

**Caller:** I've been taking Synthroid since 9th grade. My thyroid organ doesn't function.

**Andrew Murray:** I've talked to many people who get no benefit from Synthroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The active thyroid hormone, T3, is itself directly anti-inflammatory. Synthroid does have the good function of suppressing TSH, so if you take enough to keep TSH close to zero, that has an anti-inflammatory effect. But the main anti-inflammatory action of thyroid is through T3.

**Caller:** I think my body has a problem with uptake.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoiding polyunsaturated fat is very important because it blocks the activation of thyroid into T3.

**Caller:** I always thought butter was probably better. I'm also interested in the iodine you mentioned.

**Andrew Murray:** I used 7% liquid iodine topically on lesions. One cleared up in about 35 days, the other took about 65 days.

**Caller:** Thank you very much. This has been so informative.

## Environmental Enrichment and Breathing

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you've mentioned an anti-inflammatory lifestyle involving aspirin, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Other things people often neglect are getting sunlight as much as possible and doing things that are fun. You've heard of the "enriched environment" rat experiments; it made their brains not only more intelligent but also bigger. That kind of entertaining environment causes rats to produce more progesterone and have lower estrogen. Just doing things that are fun and interesting keeps your hormones in the right direction.

**Andrew Murray:** That backs up animal studies showing that rats given no escape fail quickly, while those in enriched environments thrive. People who feel entrapped need to get outside of themselves, even if it just means stepping outside and looking at the sky.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Speaking of breathing, I should mention that one of the main effects of taking thyroid or having good thyroid function is producing carbon dioxide. So you don't want to over-breathe.

**Andrew Murray:** Good point. Thank you for your questions. Dr. Peat's website is RayPeat.com, where he has many fully referenced articles. We can be reached at 1-888-WBM-HERB or westernbotanicalmedicine.com.
