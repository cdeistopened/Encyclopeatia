## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. It is August 21, 2020. You are invited to call in with any questions about the continuing dialogue, facts, and science around the pandemic and COVID-19. We are going to bring out that this is not conspiracy; we always look to the facts, and we will provide links for everything we discuss so people can find the information for themselves.

My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to the show.

**Andrew Murray:** We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us with some new information and some reiterations of information we've given previously. For those who have not heard you before, Dr. Peat, would you explain your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied for a PhD in biology, specializing in reproductive physiology, at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. My thesis was on the oxidative changes with aging. Before that, I was studying various things in the humanities—literature, linguistics, some psychology, and philosophy—and I started a college in Mexico which I ran for several years.

## The Push for a Digital Society

**Andrew Murray:** Last month, and for several months, we've been following the news about COVID worldwide. With the philosophy of "first do no harm," our goal is to provide factual information.

I want to discuss a document entitled *Codex Alimentarius*, which we first came across around 2003 from Dr. Rima Laibow. Everything that came from that seems to be borne out in current events—the steady rise and implementation of the Codex to "harmonize" everything, removing individuality.

I also saw a video from investigative journalist Harry Vox, filmed in 2014, where he explains a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation publication entitled *Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development*. It parodies almost exactly what is happening now. It mentions the term "lockstep," referring to governments initiating top-down control with authoritarian interventions. It praises the authoritarian leadership of China for controlling outbreaks like SARS and H5N1.

This lies at odds with our entrepreneurial, free-speech society. Dr. Peat, you are familiar with *Codex Alimentarius* and the mechanisms by which the hierarchy is set for control of the population.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I remember about 50 years ago, the Club of Rome was a group of influential people sketching out what the world "has to do." I've been following this ideology, which I think has gathered up all the dangerous and degrading ideas in our culture and is presenting them as the best alternatives to the problems created by that very system.

In the Rockefeller Report from 2010, they present four scenarios of possible futures. "Lockstep" is only one of them; the other three are descriptions of future disasters. The horrifying thing is that in each of those, digital technology is presented as the only redeeming possibility. Even though they present "lockstep" as efficient, they won't consider any future that isn't looking to digital technology as the savior.

I think that is at the heart of what has been going on for at least 80 years: the herding of all culture, humanities, and sciences together. The science community has been so indoctrinated with the lockstep mentality that if you get through university and can be called a scientist, there is no alternative thinking done. Basically, they are looking forward to this digital lockstep society.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** regarding the digital society, is that so they can feed us the information they want us to have? Or do they claim it is for our benefit so underprivileged people can access information?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only workable alternative to being controlled from above is to actually get together—teachers, students, and people in clubs doing things they are interested in. A network of people doing interesting things is a real alternative society. People would start reforming things from the bottom up if they could actually get together. But the drift has been pushing people into cubicles or working at home on computers so that they don't talk to each other.

**Andrew Murray:** That is exactly what is happening with social distancing. It is literally divide and conquer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The digital system is right at the point of taking over. They did an experiment in India abolishing paper money, and lots of people starved because they didn't have access to bank accounts. Already, they are intimating that money transfers viruses and has to be abolished for public health. That means banks will do everything. At that point, it is likely you will have to pay interest on your money because the bank will be doing the work of paying your debts and salary. Savings will be at the mercy of the banks.

## Caller: UV Light for Disinfection

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the air.

**Caller:** I would like to offer an affordable, simple solution to the spread of COVID-19 and other pathogens. The biggest spreader is currency, door handles, ATM machines, and menus. Everything can be retrofitted with a battery-operated or electrically installed ultraviolet (UV) disinfectant light. I don't know why they aren't doing this everywhere.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think about COVID-19 regarding door handles and using ultraviolet light as a disinfectant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some viruses, like the herpes virus, do spread fairly well for several hours off surfaces. I don't think COVID is that tough, but if there is a gob of virus-containing material, it's possible. LED ultraviolet devices are now so cheap and compact that it would be possible to use them widely.

In 1955, when I first went to Mexico City, I noticed that every restaurant—even the poorest ones—had a water collector dripping through a small ultraviolet bulb, disinfecting every drop of water served. It would be a hundred times cheaper and easier now.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you could use a little UV light on a shopping cart handle to kill the herpes virus, for example? Do you think that would be more cost-effective than alcohol spray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in certain circumstances.

**Andrew Murray:** Are we being trained to become people that are just worried? It seems like complete knowledge leads to complete paranoia.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't approve of worrying about viruses on surfaces. If you think you're susceptible to the viruses, all you have to do is remember not to put your hands in your mouth, eyes, or nose until you have a chance to wash them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I guess the exception comes with children in a grocery store. They are constantly sticking their hands in their mouths.

## Politics Influencing Science

**Andrew Murray:** I want to cover an article by Josh Mitteldorf titled *Politics Influences the Science of COVID-19*. He outlines that social distancing is questionable regarding the numbers, and that the actual numbers have been conflated. Dr. Peat, what do you interpret as happening with the actual figures right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The political action has been almost entirely based on a mathematical model of infection produced by a group at Imperial College London (Neil Ferguson's group). They delivered it to the government on March 16, setting the lockdown in motion because they predicted several million deaths.

More recently, this group published an article in *Nature* pushing the same discredited mathematical model, claiming the lockdown prevented millions of deaths. They neglected the fact that the influenza season naturally drops off in the spring and summer. The curve is exactly like that.

When you look at the total deaths in the United States week by week—the CDC has them going back for years—they show a continuous decline. Total U.S. weekly deaths have declined steadily since the middle of May. When total mortality is decreasing, but there is a slight upturn in deaths diagnosed as COVID, you know that can be explained because people have been instructed to include any suspicious death as a COVID death.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned previously that the numbers were being manipulated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I looked at the data recently. Looking backward to February 1st, they were showing a historically low rate of death starting January 1st of this year. Then, those "missing" deaths popped up in the April COVID mortality peak.

Just recently, the numbers going back 25 weeks were revised upward. These reports coming in from all over the U.S. starting January 1st were supposedly underreported. Previously, the CDC finalized their figures by the third week. Now, suddenly, they looked back 25 weeks and changed these numbers. It is one falsification on top of another.

## Caller: Free Speech and the Town Square

**Caller:** I want to go back to when you were talking about divide and conquer. That's not new. But we do not have to believe lies. We are capable of having these conversations amongst ourselves. Arcata still has a town square; so does Garberville. Town squares were eliminated strategically so there wouldn't be dissension. But I see the tide turning. We must not be imprisoned by lies.

**Andrew Murray:** That is the whole point of free speech in this country. It gives everybody, from the crackpot to the scientist, the equal opportunity to voice their opinion. Quelling that free speech is the most dangerous threat we have in America.

## Analyzing the Mortality Data

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, back to the numbers.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can I clarify? Dr. Peat, are you saying that if you look at this year's total deaths compared to previous years, we are not any higher on total deaths?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I and several others looked at them in February, March, and April, they were below historical weekly averages. The death rate was collapsing by 5% or 10% every week starting January 1st.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And then there was a historical high in April all of a sudden?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, convenient. If you had been skimming off the reported deaths and saving them up, they would just about make that peak. But about a week ago, I looked back at those same numbers. They have revised 25 weeks backwards so that my list now shows the deficit that *had* been there, but now they show what looks like a normal mortality rate. I haven't heard any comments on this revision.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we can't really tell. If death is really the same from all-cause mortality, and you compare January through August of this year with 2019 or 2018, are you saying there is absolutely no difference this year compared to previous years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And with the great peak of COVID-19 in April, there was a simultaneous crash in mortality from the flu. Deborah Birx in the CDC commented that things that were not really COVID were being put down as COVID due to incorrect diagnosis. She disappeared from public view right after she said that.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I heard her say she estimates about 25% of the COVID deaths are actually other flus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By their own numbers, you see the straight line down of influenza deaths and the straight line up of COVID deaths. Denis Rancourt has a graph plotted from the CDC's own numbers showing an absolutely impossible curve of mortality—a crash that is impossible in any natural way. He says it should be prosecuted as a crime.

## The Economic Reset

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Assuming they are playing with the numbers, what is their end game? Why is the CDC doing this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Klaus Schwab announced a few months ago that the January meeting of the World Economic Forum would be called "The Great Reset." He said that planetary warming was working toward their goal, but very slowly. Now, the virus is going to allow it to happen very quickly. Their goal is to shut down the old economy so it has to be replaced by online digital substitutes. For example, replacing thousands of retailers across the country with places like Amazon. Incidentally, Jeff Bezos' wealth increased by $25 billion in just a few weeks.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the end game is to consolidate power and control global warming?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Global warming was just another point in the same direction. But the ability to turn off the economy directly by order wouldn't have been possible for global warming. This is exactly what they wanted, according to Klaus Schwab himself.

**Andrew Murray:** Collapsing economies and rebuilding them by the IMF and World Bank is nothing new.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even Hitler made allowances for the German people surviving. That isn't in the present program. No one has explained how the "idle workers" are going to be disposed of. When you have hundreds of millions of people displaced by digital robots, what are you going to do with them? They will be expensive to support.

## Caller: The Pronoun "They"

**Caller:** I'm from Fort Bragg. Could you please quit using the pronoun "they" and name who you are talking about doing all this nefarious stuff?

**Andrew Murray:** We have been very specific about names and dates. If you listen to the archive, most of what we're saying has been substantiated by names, dates, and places.

## Ventilators and Physiology

**Andrew Murray:** I want to mention two people I brought up two months ago: Nurse Erin Marie Olszewski, who was whistleblowing on fatalities from ventilators, and Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell, the New York ER doctor. He said ventilators were doing the damage and that this was not like any other sudden acute respiratory disease.

Treatment has changed drastically. I know surgeons in Los Angeles saying that in their ER wards, they are using hydroxychloroquine and Losartan effectively. Dr. Peat, the virus exists, but treatment has changed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thing that Kyle-Sidell and one other doctor in Brooklyn pointed out was that they were treating patients in exactly the wrong way. They pointed out that patients had the classical symptoms of high-altitude sickness, which is basically a carbon dioxide deficit. If you pump oxygen into their lungs, you kill them.

Gradually, over a period of several weeks, the establishment started catching on in a slow, reluctant way. Basically, they've stopped murdering thousands of people by stuffing tubes in when they should be giving them a little extra carbon dioxide with their respiratory oxygen, without forcing it in.

## Caller: Hyperbaric Chambers

**Caller:** I'm calling from Redway. I wanted to know about hyperbaric chambers. I've heard that people are doing high-pressure chamber treatment, which might link in with the symptoms of high-altitude sickness.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The problem is carbon dioxide. When you are having poisoning leading to sepsis and inflammation of the lungs—like these COVID symptoms or high-altitude sickness—the carbon dioxide can escape through the damaged lung, but you can't get oxygen in.

The inflammation produces sepsis, which produces lactic acid. Lactic acid drives off the carbon dioxide. That blocks the urge to breathe. When you are deficient in carbon dioxide, you don't feel a great need to breathe, even though your oxygen is getting low.

If you give more oxygen, that might help if you can get it in through the skin or intestine. But adding some carbon dioxide to the system is the only way you're going to get their physiological working back—the urge to breathe properly.

**Andrew Murray:** In hospitals, they monitor O2 saturation. They say 98% or 99% is great, and COVID patients drop to the 40s or 50s. I know you don't agree with the goal of high oxygen saturation per se. What do you think a healthy person's oxygen saturation should be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've noticed for years that when I'm comfortable, mine is in the low 90s. But if I run up a hill, my oxygen will go up to 96% or 100%. When I am really using a lot of oxygen, my saturation goes up.

Trying to figure out what was happening, I tried warming or cooling my hand. I found that cooling my hand would produce a very high saturation because my hand was not consuming any oxygen; it was effectively a metabolically dead hand. Warming my hand up to body temperature, it starts burning oxygen and holds the level down to around 94%.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you very much for joining us again, Dr. Peat.
