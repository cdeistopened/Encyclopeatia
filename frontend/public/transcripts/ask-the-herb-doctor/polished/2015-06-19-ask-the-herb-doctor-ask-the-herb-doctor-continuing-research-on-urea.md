## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, we’re both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice. You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM.

From 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of the continuing research on urea. The number if you live in the area is 923-3911, or toll-free 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show to share his latest research. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. I’d like to start by giving you the opportunity to let people know your academic and scientific background.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got my PhD in biology, specializing in physiology and biochemistry, especially reproductive physiology, at the University of Oregon in 1972. Before that, I had been interested in language, philosophy, and psychology and planned to study brain biology. I found that reproductive physiology seemed more scientific and interesting, so I specialized in that but continued to be interested in the rest of the organism.

The first thing I did after graduating was to write a book on the brain, reviewing Russian science from the 19th through the 20th century on brain biology. I've continued my interest in how basic energy physiology relates to things such as reproduction, aging, and brain functions.

## The Physiology of Urea (Carbamide)

**Andrew Murray:** In your most recent newsletter, you continued your discourse on urea and its use in pathology. You discussed how you see the function of urea benefiting people, despite it perhaps being dismissed by mainstream medical science. You mentioned Danopoulos, the Greek physician who has been successfully using urea as a therapy, injecting it into tumors for cancer. But this newsletter explores other physiological effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Doctor, can you tell us what urea is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its chemical name is carbamide. It's just a combination of ammonia with carbon dioxide. It is the body's way of detoxifying ammonia, and it requires the oxidative production of carbon dioxide to combine with the ammonia to get rid of it. It regulates cell pH, which regulates water metabolism and everything else in cell function.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's something that our bodies produce.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Given that we understand that excess water in the cell is a central feature of major degenerative diseases like heart failure, dementia, and cancer, how do you explain how this happens? What is the best strategy to prevent this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thinking about water and cells comes up against some of the basic dogmas of what life is and how cells work. I think the reason Danopoulos' amazing results in curing cancer with simply injecting or giving intravenous urea have been ignored is that it involves ideas that don't fit with the mechanical dogmas of 20th-century biology.

The main dogma is the membrane theory—the idea that there are pumps in cell surface membranes that regulate the amount of water and minerals by somehow grabbing molecules and pushing them in or out. It's really a silly, impossible concept, but it's what everything officially is based on.

If you look at the facts of what's happening with water, think in terms of what happens when gelatin gets wet. If you put acid or alkali on it, its relation to water changes. Acid makes it shrink; alkali makes it swell up. Simple physical ideas like that are very useful for thinking about what happens in diseases.

**Andrew Murray:** You said acid makes it shrink and alkaline situations make it swell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Swelling has an anabolic effect and turns on cell division. Uncontrollable cell division can produce everything from cancer to various skin diseases like dandruff, psoriasis, or an overgrowth of fibrous tissue. The control of cell growth is deeply controlled by water and pH.

People blame everything on this magical membrane pump, but if you think about basic metabolic processes—turning sugar, fat, or protein into energy and carbon dioxide—this constant streaming of substance produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acid. When you're alive, you are making cells acidic inside. As it leaves, it takes minerals out of the cell with it in the form of carbonic acid and the alkaline minerals associated with it.

**Andrew Murray:** This is a better state than the alkaline state, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The acidic state produced by carbon dioxide causes a shift in the whole balance of electrons in the protein, fat, and nucleic acid system. That shift of electrons accounts for the preference of the cell for potassium over sodium. If the cell is disturbed, it shifts, loses potassium, and takes up calcium and sodium. This is what Gilbert Ling has devoted his life to for the last 60-some years.

**Andrew Murray:** I think laypeople often associate an "acid" situation as cancer-promoting and "alkaline" as beneficial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's true when you apply it to the blood and the fluid *outside* of cells. But the reason the fluid outside of cells is alkaline is that the protons—the electrons—are being retracted into an acidic state *inside* the cell. That shifts the balance and makes it alkaline outside.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when the inside of the cell becomes alkaline, that's when it becomes swollen and boggy, contributing to heart disease, cancer, and psoriasis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, along with a shift towards acidity in the blood and the outside fluid. When people say you don't want to be acidic metabolically, that refers to the fluids outside of cells. It's only since nuclear magnetic resonance apparatuses have been used in the last 40 years that people have started to recognize that inside cells should be slightly acidic.

## Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, and Cell Structure

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How do we make the inside of our cells more acidic and keep the outside alkaline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By keeping the energy flowing and producing carbon dioxide constantly by consuming oxygen. If you suffocate or turn off the oxygen supply, you stop making a steady supply of carbon dioxide. The metabolism shifts over to making lactic acid. The lactic acid takes acid out of the cell as it leaves, acidifying the environment but leaving the cell interior more alkaline.

**Andrew Murray:** And that's the negative acidic situation most people refer to.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's a local inflammatory situation. Anytime a tissue is injured, it tends to produce excess lactic acid and become inflamed and inefficient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How does urea help our cells use oxygen better or keep the cell more acidic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cell holds its structure by the way proteins are folded, which requires an interaction with the slightly acidic state—making carbon dioxide and keeping the ATP level at a high energy state. This keeps the water participating in the way proteins are folded so that there's a lot of internal surface area exposed.

You know how the surface of a glass of water has a sort of rubbery film, surface tension, where you can float a piece of steel? Inside the cell, when the proteins are energized, the ATP holds them in a state exposing their surface, keeping the cell water in that energized, tough state that holds the cell together.

When it's de-energized, the structure collapses. Spherical proteins that were exposing all their surface polymerize into stalk-like proteins with less surface exposure. The water becomes more like plain bulk water. That kind of water is involved in cell swelling and uncontrolled cell division.

**Andrew Murray:** The pH inside a cell also regulates the protein's folding ability, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the case of any protein jelly, even some synthetic plastics, alkalinity has the effect of making the jelly swell up and become watery and soft.

**Andrew Murray:** So again, an alkaline internal environment is not helpful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Urea happens to be a strange kind of solvent that is pretty much equally at home inside and outside the cells, but it's slightly *more* at home in a healthy, stable cell. Just by solubility, if you immerse cells in a solution with urea, the urea will come to rest at a higher concentration inside the cells. No pumping is involved. Inside the cell, it participates with the energized state, helping proteins expose the surface that keeps cells in a high-energy state.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's how Danopoulos helped with cancer? By injecting urea, it helped cells maintain their shape and function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and to keep it towards the slightly acidic metabolizing state in which it doesn't tend to proliferate—a relatively slightly dehydrated effect. When you have the right amount of urea mixed with proteins, fats, and water, it creates a new state of matter that has its own solubility properties, including the preference for potassium over sodium and magnesium over calcium.

## Urea Toxicity and Osmotic Myths

**Andrew Murray:** You stated that urea itself is not an osmolyte and does not affect pH, is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's been known for over 100 years. People used semipermeable membranes and found it doesn't behave like sodium or potassium, which pull water across a membrane. Around World War I, it was demonstrated that you could make urea five or six times more concentrated than it should be osmotically, and it would be in balance and not cause cells to lose water. If you had that concentration of sugar or salt, you would dry up.

**Andrew Murray:** And you mentioned that concentration is very low toxicity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sea organisms, like sharks, have a very high level of urea. Experiments have shown that even more than 100 times what we normally have doesn't cause damage to cells. Therapeutically, Danopoulos found that maybe a hundred times our normal serum urea level is therapeutic for things like cancer and brain function.

**Andrew Murray:** The scientific community seems to play down urea or use analogues which are problematic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sickle cell anemia, for example, was being treated successfully with urea. Normal cells under stress tend to harden the way sickle cells become stiff. During heart surgery, stress causes ordinary red blood cells to stiffen and malfunction. With a supplement of urea, that hardening is prevented.

However, because of the myth of urea being an osmolyte, someone used plain urea without the normal sodium and minerals in the solution. It caused red blood cells to break down immediately. They said, "That can't be good," stopped using it, and shifted over to the very toxic, carcinogenic hydroxyurea, which is still in use.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you know doctors that use real urea currently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few people are using it, for example, to prevent killing patients in heart surgery, but it definitely isn't a well-recognized treatment.

**Andrew Murray:** To clarify, urea in the absence of other electrolytes acts like distilled water regarding osmotic property?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It would take about six times as much urea as normal to not break down the red cells.

## Diuretics, Heart Failure, and Stress

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about taking it orally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's been done for over 100 years, treating heart failure. One person reported having heart failure patients doing well on oral urea for as long as nine years.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this because it's a diuretic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was the argument—that it relieved swollen legs in congestive heart failure. But since you also see it bringing people back from brain damage in traumatic head injury and strokes, I think it has much deeper therapeutic effects, stabilizing cells in many ways, not just reducing swelling by causing diuresis.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you have any opinion on traditional diuretics versus urea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mercury was a traditional diuretic, and it apparently worked just by killing the tubes of the kidney and letting the water fall out of the body. I think some chemical diuretics are about as well-founded as mercury. Diuretic chemicals that make the kidneys give up more water don't necessarily improve the person's health.

Any stress involves a series of reactions, all of which relate to the way cells handle water. Nitric oxide is universally produced by injury and stress, and it causes de-energizing and swelling of cells. Estrogen is a physiological producer of swelling, imitating a stress reaction. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is another stress-induced producer of water retention.

Old people and hospitalized trauma patients often develop water retention with sodium loss—hyponatremia, or the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. Estrogen produces the same effect. Nitric oxide, estrogen, and ADH produce a state of getting waterlogged while losing sodium into the urine.

The normal regulator of carbon dioxide—and thus sodium/water balance—is the thyroid hormone. Hypothyroid people always tend towards this syndrome of being waterlogged and losing sodium. Sodium itself, sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, can cure a lot of these stress conditions.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think the same waterlogging could happen in a boggy intestine that fails to move food, contributing to endotoxin reabsorption?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The intestine is especially exposed to things such as endotoxin, which release nitric oxide, causing this de-energizing, swelling effect.

**Andrew Murray:** So bicarbonate of soda would be a good way of liberating CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Surprisingly, even sodium chloride has a diuretic effect in most people. When you use baking soda, the kidneys are able to retain as much sodium as they want, but the bicarbonate can be changed back into carbon dioxide and actually help to acidify cells on the inside while maintaining the sodium on the outside.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people can just swallow a quarter or half teaspoon mixed with water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I know people who have taken a teaspoon two or three times a day with water for many years. Athletes sometimes take a tablespoon with water before an endurance race. I think part of the effect on endurance is helping to prevent excess nitric oxide production.

**Andrew Murray:** Are endurance runners who collapse from cardiac arrest often hyponatremic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's probably the most common reason for endurance runners collapsing and dying.

## Aging and Skin Health

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding aging and skin, young people have plump, healthy skin. As we age, keratin production increases. Is there anything that can be done to improve skin quality related to water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Plumpness is largely the water content. A fertilized ovum is 92% water; an old cell gets down to about 65% water. As that happens, cell division slows. In old skin, there are fewer cells, so it is thinner.

The piling up of collapsed, keratinized cells accumulates in old skin. This maturing process comes on prematurely with aging or stress. For example, a vitamin A deficiency will cause premature keratinizing. Estrogen does this normally in mucous membranes—first causing faster growth due to water uptake, but then increased keratin formation and hardening.

You can offset some effects of aging and estrogen by supplementing vitamin A, vitamin E, and urea directly into the skin. Old skin has much less urea than young skin, which is likely both a cause and effect of lower water content.

## Caller Questions

### Caller 1: Heart Failure and Urea Dosage

**Caller:** My dad is in the hospital with CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) and dementia. He's on a diuretic and Gabapentin. His lactic acid was normal, but creatinine was not. Would oral urea be better for him, and can he take it with the furosemide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can find articles on PubMed about the use of urea in heart failure comparing it to other diuretics.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would that be something he could use orally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very tasteless, maybe a little salty. It's usually taken with orange juice or grapefruit juice. A small amount, anywhere from a fourth of a teaspoon to a teaspoon per glass.

**Caller:** Would it be okay to take that with the diuretic he is already prescribed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think it interferes with the diuretics; it just makes them unnecessary.

### Caller 2: Diet for Cell Acidity

**Caller:** What should one ingest to make the cells more acidic on the inside and the blood more alkaline on the outside?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Getting adequate protein in your diet is probably the thing that makes the biggest difference. You can measure the increased output of urea in the urine in proportion to the amount of protein you're eating. If your digestion and thyroid function are good, eating protein helps.

**Caller:** Is red meat good for that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meat is very high in phosphate, so it shouldn't be too high. Gelatin is good as a supplement—making soup with collagenous joint tissue like oxtail or shank. It's better to get a big part of your protein from other foods such as eggs, milk, cheese, and high-quality vegetables like potatoes and mushrooms.

**Caller:** You mentioned sodium chloride. Is salt good for your heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salting your food to taste is the best way to tell. In people who are under stress, for example, women with toxemia of pregnancy, salt helps. I saw the same problems existing in women in their 20s and men in their 80s—inflammatory high blood pressure symptoms. I suggested they salt their food to taste instead of a low sodium diet.

**Caller:** I've been taught salt causes high blood pressure and water retention.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They've disproven that. They only started saying you shouldn't eat salt when they wanted to sell diuretics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The blood volume gets oxygen and nutrients to the kidneys and keeps them working.

**Caller:** What about gout? Is that caused by too much meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors aren't too sure what it is either. People can have a lot of uric acid crystals without symptoms. It seems to be endotoxin from an inflamed intestine getting deposited on the crystals causing symptoms. Urea is protective against uric acid.

### Caller 3: Thyroid and Water Retention

**Caller:** I've had water retention problems since I was pregnant with my first child 45 years ago. I have an underactive thyroid and take levothyroxine, but I still swell up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For quite a while, it's been known that estrogen interferes with the conversion of levothyroxine (T4) into the active hormone (T3). That accounts for why women have about five times as much thyroid problems as men. Illogically, doctors prescribe thyroxine to women without measuring the liver function of producing the active hormone T3.

**Andrew Murray:** It sounds like you're not converting the hormone because of high estrogen. You'd be better off using a T3 supplement. Even if your TSH test is "normal," your symptoms—low temperature, weight gain, insomnia—indicate otherwise.

### Caller 4: Urine Therapy

**Caller:** Is drinking your own urine a good way to get urea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know quite a few people who have done it and seem to be very healthy. It's been practiced for three or four thousand years. However, I think most people would prefer to use the purified chemical rather than their own urine.

## Psoriasis and Gut Health

**Andrew Murray:** Let's quickly talk about psoriasis, urea, and inflammatory bowel disease. Is there a parallel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One thing to consider when you have both bowel and skin symptoms is that the bowel is actually causing the skin problem. Eliminating gluten, for example, sometimes clears up both because some of the same enzymes activated by inflammation cause the premature hardening of the skin in psoriasis.

The process of psoriasis is an accelerated cell division, probably caused by over-hydration and possibly a lack of the right balance of estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid. Vitamin A and D can restrain the rate of multiplication.

Urea has been demonstrated to delay or prevent that premature hardening process by governing gene expression, keeping the cell in a vital state longer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So urea can be injected, taken orally, or rubbed on topically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There are creams available containing 5% to 40% urea. A 40% solution is very effective for treating psoriasis and ichthyosis. Some pharmacists might scare you saying it removes fingernails, but the 40% solutions are very soothing and therapeutic. It is now widely used for treating skin inflammation in breast cancer patients exposed to X-rays.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to hold it there. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
