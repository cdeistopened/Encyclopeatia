## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this evening's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to the shows, they run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM. We have our very special guest speaker who is full of information about current events as well as historically accurate past events, which brings everything into context.

Tonight, we will be discussing a loose topic on stress, GABA systems, different herbs that can combat stress, and mitochondrial support. Dr. Peat will be bringing his wisdom and expertise regarding mitochondrial activity and how that plays in with hormones like thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone. These support the anti-inflammatory cascade that battles the inflammation most people are constantly under attack with.

Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us again. As usual, I think it's good to outline your professional and academic background so new listeners can understand your expertise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After 10 or 15 years of working in language and literature, I shifted over to biology, specifically aging, metabolism, and reproduction. I studied at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972 for a biology PhD.

## Mitochondria and Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** We’ve heard a lot from you in the past regarding thyroid hormone physiology, progesterone, pregnenolone, and aging. Tonight we are discussing mitochondria: what they do, how they operate, and what substances deactivate them over time.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, can you explain simply what the mitochondria is? I've been told it's the "powerhouse of the cell." Can you explain that to our listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a good enough definition, but there is a very stereotyped, textbook definition of it consisting of a certain kind of membrane, special enzymes, and some DNA separate from the nucleus. It handles various functions other than energy production. Steroid synthesis is one of its very important functions. It converts cholesterol into pregnenolone and progesterone, and those turn into all of the steroid hormones.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that why when people age, their cholesterol goes up? Because their mitochondria aren't as efficient in converting the cholesterol into those hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Thyroid is the main hormone that activates the oxidative metabolism of the mitochondrion. If your thyroid is low, the mitochondria don't pull in the cholesterol and turn it into pregnenolone. The other cofactor working with thyroid happens to be Vitamin A. A protein in the blood carries thyroid and Vitamin A on a single protein and delivers it to the mitochondria, where they act like a factory with a conveyor belt bringing in the raw materials and the catalysts.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's how they make the hormones—the cholesterol plus the Vitamin A makes progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Vitamin A is involved in steroid formation not only in the gonads and adrenals but also in the brain and the skin. The skin and the brain are major steroid endocrine glands.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So every cell in our body has mitochondria doing its job in that particular part of the body. But if you don't have adequate thyroid, you won't be getting adequate oxygen into that mitochondria, and basic energy production and cellular function will be decreased.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Red blood cells have mitochondria, but they depend on sugar—glucose—for their energy.

## Cell Membranes and Physiology

**Andrew Murray:** I know you’ve mentioned in the past that the physiological explanation of membranes is pretty flawed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was studying, the textbook definition of what a mitochondrion is and how it works used a membrane and the "chemiosmotic hypothesis." The membrane has to have certain metaphysical properties. If you look at a real cell oxidizing, it turns out that the outer surface of the cell has mitochondrial-like properties. The same enzyme reactions using oxygen and consuming electrons happen right at the surface of the cell as well as in the mitochondrion.

**Andrew Murray:** So the supposition that the membrane is a cohesive barrier—not fluid or dynamic, but a skin with channels and pumps—is incorrect?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And what about all the organelles? Is that completely bogus as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are suspected to be largely artifacts of fixation. Things are differentiated, but when you kill them, take out the water, harden them, and slice them, things don't look the way they did when they were alive.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is there no way they can look at the cell while it's alive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can use a fluorescent stain, for example, and see very amazing things—things swirling around. But sometimes the structures seem to be more like a whirlwind than an organelle.

In the 1940s, when radioactive isotopes became available, the whole idea of the barrier membrane was eliminated. Gilbert Ling reviews the history of that. There is no barrier to sodium; it zips in and out of the cell.

**Andrew Murray:** I was always taught about the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which needed a molecule of ATP to pump in and pump out a molecule of sodium and potassium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But if you take a hair, which is perfectly dead, wash out the minerals, and then dip it in blood serum or plasma, you get the same unequal distribution of the minerals—potassium inside and sodium outside. It's exactly the same principle as a water softener, where you charge it with sodium and then it removes calcium from the hard water.

A man named M.Y. Seltz wrote a book on the physics of water softeners. He recognized Gilbert Ling's work in biology as the best explanation for how a water softener works. The physics was so good in describing cells that even physicists recognized it worked for something as common as a water softener. But biologists just don't like that way of looking at cells. It tends to leave out a lot of their favorite beliefs about genes and so on.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that where the word "micelle" was coined from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned a single protein carries Vitamin A and cholesterol. Do you know the name of that protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) that delivers cholesterol, and then prealbumin or transthyretin, which transports the thyroid and Vitamin A.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it would be dangerous to have a low LDL, which most doctors call the "bad cholesterol." It's actually a good one.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because it brings the stuff to make cholesterol out of.

**Andrew Murray:** Once again, cholesterol is not the enemy. LDL cholesterol chaperones these very important molecules to enable steroid synthesis. Without cholesterol, you'd be in bad shape. I heard recently that the brain's white matter is 95% cholesterol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why studies showed older people with low cholesterol were much more prone to dementia.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you advocate cholesterol should be between 180 and 200, and slightly over 200 after age 50.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. According to the Framingham study, people over 50 who weren't above 200 in cholesterol were more likely to have dementia.

## Valerian and GABA

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to herbs like Valerian root. It is used for insomnia or anxiety as a mild sedative. I was told its main attribute was that the valerenic acid inhibited the breakdown of GABA. What do you know about GABA as a neurotransmitter, and is Valerian's use warranted?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think Valerian also increases the activity of the enzyme that converts the excitatory glutamic acid into the inhibitory GABA. So it does just about everything needed to protect the brain: increasing GABA and the effect of GABA.

The "GABA receptor" system is probably the most complex bunch of proteins that has the name receptor. Many different things affect it in different ways. Valerian—or Valium—binds to it in a way similar to GABA, but in a slightly different way than progesterone, pregnenolone, probably androgens, and even carbon dioxide. These stabilize a whole system of proteins to turn off the excitatory process in the cell.

**Andrew Murray:** "Excitatory" is a very wasteful state to be in, isn't it? Short-term activity is fine, but long-term excitation is detrimental.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what causes brain fatigue. If you stay awake too long and don't have a good supply of glucose producing carbon dioxide, you more quickly get into the fatigued state. Glucose substantially contributes to the formation of GABA. Carbon dioxide stabilizes it, and when glutamic acid is converted into GABA, it also releases carbon dioxide that helps with the inhibitory process.

Oxidative metabolism in the brain is doing many things: producing GABA, progesterone, pregnenolone, and carbon dioxide, while keeping down the excitatory things like lactic acid, nitric oxide, glutamic acid, and ammonia.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's estimated that 10% of people respond to Valerian in the opposite way—they get excited, almost like cats do. Can you explain why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not at all.

**Andrew Murray:** St. John's Wort is also posited to be a reuptake inhibitor of GABA, specifically the compound hyperforin. Lemon balm was shown to be a GABA transaminase inhibitor, blocking the enzyme that converts GABA to succinic semialdehyde and glutamate. The body obviously has a fine tune to keep this homeostasis running.

Regarding mitochondrial disease, one of the main downsides is a kind of somnambulence where people get seizures. Is the optimum state a balance between the GABAergic side and keeping things stable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I call that the "high energy resting state," in which the cells, especially in the brain, have so much energy that they're ready to do anything. But when you get very fatigued, they lack the energy needed to replenish that work-ready condition. They enter a hypersensitive, agitated condition. Their resting voltage goes very low, and they stay in a constantly excited but unable-to-work condition.

Magnesium is one of the things that helps restore the relaxed state. Thyroid helps you retain magnesium. Magnesium stabilizes the high-energy ATP molecule. Without thyroid, you can't make ATP very quickly. If you have adequate thyroid producing oxidative energy and ATP, the cell retains magnesium. That complex holds the cell in a ready-to-work state with lots of reserve energy. A magnesium deficiency will cause seizures, insomnia, and inflammation—everything that a lack of energy leads to.

**Andrew Murray:** So it is important to have small amounts of sugars and foods regularly so the body's energy supply is constantly stocked, rather than going four or six hours without food.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the B vitamins are essential for using oxygen efficiently in the mitochondria—Vitamin B1, biotin, B2.

## Melatonin and Seasonality

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to melatonin. Advertising is very pro-sleeping and relaxing. It is naturally produced and found in foods. What is your impression of melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The good side is that in the fatigued state of the brain—the excitatory, de-energized condition—nitric oxide rises and starts a vicious circle where it activates acetylcholine, which activates nitric oxide synthesis. This can keep you awake. Melatonin is effective at turning off that cycle. So when your brain is in a bad fatigue state, melatonin can protect it by lowering nitric oxide and excitation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would that be in a small dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. One publication refers to the physiological dose as equivalent to 5 micrograms per body in an average-sized adult. Others have measured it as up to 2 or 3 milligrams in the whole body. When a person takes 10 milligrams, it will put them to sleep, but it is probably doing lots of other things.

In antioxidant or radiation protection experiments, they've used a thousand or maybe a million times the physiological concentration. It can do amazing things like protect against gamma rays, but the outcome might have unexpected consequences.

In the late 1990s, when the material became cheap, studies claimed it was anti-cancer, anti-stress, and anti-inflammatory. But when I was in graduate school, it was known that pineal extract had specific effects that imitated nighttime and winter. In the winter, the reproductive systems of animals—fish, turtles, lizards, rats, sheep—shrink. The thymus gland also regresses, which affects the immune system. This involution of reproductive glands and the thymus has behavioral consequences, like Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), depression, and weight gain. Melatonin is the main thing that causes this involution.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in different parts of the world, like Hawaii near the equator, seasonal changes don't exist.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right, you don't have the winter sickness or winter immune disturbance.

**Andrew Murray:** I read conflicting information on PubMed. Some said melatonin suppresses tumor aerobic metabolism (the Warburg effect), and others said it was pro-cancerous.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of that varies with the variety of mouse used. Sometimes it decreases tumors, sometimes it increases them. The effect on the immune system partly depends on the dose. At least two groups, one in China and one in Denver, are seeing very clear pro-inflammatory effects from physiological amounts of melatonin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It doesn't seem like you'd want to take something that triggers the wintertime response.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what I've always thought. In our hamster lab, even though the lab was temperature-controlled with a 12-hour light cycle, the hamsters had essentially no thymus gland during the winter. That started me thinking about the potential risk of changing your whole endocrine system by supplementing something like that.

## Caller: Tooth Decay

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the air. Where are you from?

**Caller:** San Francisco, California. Hi, Dr. Peat. I wanted to know what causes tooth decay and how do you reverse it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's stress-related. There is one type of cavity that starts with a white area rather than the usual dark area. It comes on very fast with the mobilization of calcium from the dentin under the influence of stress. Another kind is related to stress starting from the outside with the mobilization of calcium because of imbalances and pro-inflammatory factors in the saliva.

The basic thing is to keep your energy up and stress low so that you don't have either harmful saliva or an internal anti-calcium system. Vitamin D and Vitamin K are very important for keeping calcium in the hard tissue. Serotonin has been found to be a major calcium disruptor in the bones and teeth as well. It's really a matter of your total systemic health more than just what happens in your mouth.

**Caller:** Thank you very much.

## Adaptogens and Rhodiola

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think about the use of melatonin in radiotherapy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you're bound to have the radiation, very large doses of melatonin are probably protective against the damaging effect. The trouble with using it for treating tumors is that you can kill off the bulk cells of the tumor, but if you haven't cured the organism's problem, you irritate the region and stimulate the recruitment of new repair cells, which recreate the tumor.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to Rhodiola rosea. It has been used for thousands of years—by the Greeks, Vikings, and Chinese. It is considered an adaptogen. How do you see Rhodiola supporting mitochondria or acting as an anti-stress agent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was studying the progesterone family of steroids around the same time I ran into Ginseng and Rhodiola research. Hans Selye had the concept of "catatoxic steroids." They protect the organism by blocking the effect of a toxin. I think that's one of the effects of the adaptogens. They have steroids analogous to progesterone and testosterone in that catatoxic or stress-blocking effect.

A Russian heart researcher, Felix Meyerson, applied Selye's concept of stress to the mitochondrial level. Meyerson's idea was that we have many layers of stress-limiting signals. Steroids are one major stress-limiting system. Cortisol, serotonin, nitric oxide, and estrogen activate short-term stress reactions. If those continue, they destroy the organism. You need a stress-ending process—that's where progesterone, testosterone, and pregnenolone come in.

It happens that these plants not only have the steroid level of stress-limiting factors but also polyphenols and flavonoids that specifically turn off nitric oxide production and limit the excitatory serotonin pathway which turns on cortisol.

## Red Pigments and Antioxidants

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wanted to ask about hypericin, the red oil from St. John's Wort. I remember you saying red compounds are very antioxidant and protective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is a big polycyclic molecule. The reason it's red is that the electrons resonate and absorb a lot of light. That makes it analogous to molecules such as cascara emodin, aloe, tetracycline antibiotics, and the tricyclic antidepressants.

**Andrew Murray:** How about Pau d'Arco and Catuaba bark?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly that same type of polycyclic molecule. I think it's analogous to the stabilizing multi-ring steroid molecules. They have a geometric stabilizing action on the microstructure of the cell as well as the electronic withdrawing effect. When a cell is stressed and its voltage goes down, the local electrons become very active and attack molecules they shouldn't. When you don't have enough oxygen, you get loose electrons that cause mischief all through the cell.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's what we term free radical reaction.

**Andrew Murray:** Ubiquinone is another one of those structural molecules. What about BioPQQ? It seems to be the latest kid on the block for mitochondrial stimulation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure how important it is to have the most popular, potent antioxidant in marketing. Vitamin K happens to stabilize ubiquinone, and all of these things work in a system. When you're using Vitamin C, it is in an oxidized form that keeps Vitamin E in the right condition. Progesterone keeps ubiquinone and Vitamin K in the right system. It's a much more organized system on the small molecule level than people usually recognize.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Doesn't CoQ10 stabilize Vitamin K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they work together with the mitochondria.

**Andrew Murray:** So B vitamins are also very important in terms of electronic stability.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, keeping the cell free of lactate, because lactate represents the shift towards loose electrons that get in trouble.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who found the show this evening, Dr. Raymond Peat has a wealth of information on his website: www.raypeat.com. There are plenty of scholarly, fully referenced articles.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And our website is www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com. Thank you for listening.

**Andrew Murray:** Have a good night.
