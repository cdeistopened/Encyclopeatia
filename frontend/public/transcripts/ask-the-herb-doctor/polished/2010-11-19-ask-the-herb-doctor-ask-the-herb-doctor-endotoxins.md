## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month’s *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

The last two months we've been talking about the role of good sugars and bad sugars. This month we're very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who is going to expose the risk of endotoxin and dietary effects that influence endotoxin production. There's a lot of research now to show that endotoxin is associated with many inflammatory diseases that you wouldn't normally associate with food. So the adage "you are what you eat" is very true, and perhaps we should say that you suffer as a result of what you eat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for joining. Would you please give an outline of your expertise?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm studying hormones and nutrition mostly. I got my PhD in physiology with a biochemical orientation, concentrating on reproductive aging. That was when I got interested in the interactions of estrogen, oxygen, unsaturated fatty acids, and the toxic interactions of some of our natural materials with environmental materials and processes.

## Defining Endotoxin

**Andrew Murray:** Would you describe endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its chemical name is lipopolysaccharide. There are several kinds of bacteria that make similar things, but it's a combination of a starch-like molecule with some fatty acids attached to it. It's so widely distributed that all animals have a system for reacting to it and defending themselves against it. It seems to be partly a bacterial defense against the bacteria's environment. There is an evolved back-and-forth relationship between animals and the bacteria, and it's a matter of things getting out of balance that causes the endotoxin to be a problem.

**Andrew Murray:** I hear of many foods that promote this production. Would you be able to list some specific foods that people should be thinking about before they consume them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mostly it seems to be things that are poorly digested that pass along with a lot of food value down into the intestine where bacteria thrive on them. Things like fruit are so quickly digested by most people—the liquid parts, minerals, and sugars can be largely absorbed before you get down to the bacterial area of the intestine.

The more indigestible the food is, the more risky it is for supporting an overgrowth of bacteria. If your digestion happens to be poor, then more foods will pass along and become bacteria food. Indigestible fibrous materials and types of starch that can't be broken down by animal or human enzymes become good food for bacteria. Many of these are being promoted for intestinal health to stimulate peristalsis, but about 30 years ago, some Australian studies saw that people who ate a lot of oat bran were actually increasing the risk for bowel cancer. Certain types of fiber cause such intense growth of bacteria that the bacteria produce many types of toxins, not just the fragment of the bacterial coat known as endotoxin.

## Fiber, Digestion, and the Raw Carrot

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when people say, "I can't have a normal bowel movement if I don't eat lots of fiber," what do you say?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, there are some very safe fibers that come from plants that have their own defenses against bacteria and fungi. Raw carrots, for example. If you notice, many vegetables will spoil in the refrigerator, while carrots seem to be completely clean and unattacked by bacteria or molds. That's because there are chemicals that are defensive for those plants. When we eat them, they remain like antibiotics all the way through our intestines, so they are very hard for bacteria to grow on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And in that way, they also provide a good roughage that doesn't get broken down by bacteria.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it can also bind some of the toxins produced by bacteria. Rather than increasing the amount produced, it can actually bind it and carry it out, subtracting toxins. It's almost like the activated charcoal that's used for detoxifying ingested chemicals. The carrot is a natural way of doing that.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When people say, "If I eat a good green salad, then I have a wonderful bowel movement," is that because the bacteria are stimulating peristalsis? Because we don't have cellulose-digesting enzymes, so we are relying on the bacteria to ferment and digest the cellulose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some people get terribly constipated when they eat raw vegetables. For other people, it's enough irritation to stimulate the intestine. Doctors for a long time have warned against using stimulant laxatives, but when they recommend eating vegetables, it's really primarily a stimulant action produced by irritating substances either in the vegetable itself or produced by the bacterial growth. If you've ever left a head of lettuce in a closed container at room temperature, you know how quickly lettuce can decompose compared to a carrot. Lettuce is very good bacterial food, so it can become very toxic if you happen to catch the wrong bacteria.

## Good Sugars vs. Bad Sugars

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The last couple of months, we've spent time talking about the different types of sugars. You've been describing the health benefits of an easily digested sugar—one that gets digested in the stomach and very high up in the intestinal tract, thereby not providing food for bacteria further down. These are mainly soft, ripe, juicy fruits, honey, and even white sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the lactose in milk is another good sugar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Those are all things that our human digestive tracts can absorb quickly and efficiently without having to rely on bacterial degradation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They also have a defensive effect against the products of the bacteria, so that once you are poisoned by the endotoxin, the sugars protect by decreasing the inflammation reaction to them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if you ate starches for dinner, then having some good sugars before bed will help protect against some of the endotoxin produced by the bacteria digesting the starches. The "bad sugars" come from foods more resistant to digestion: breads, pastas, cakes, cookies, flours, grains, beans, and rice.

## Saturated Fats and Cooking Starches

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another kind of defensive food is saturated fat. If you think of soap and its antibacterial effect, saturated fats are mildly antiseptic. If you eat butter with your potato, the starch is less likely to become toxic material for the bacteria because the butter's saturated fats will suppress bacterial growth.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So mashed potatoes with lots of milk and butter can protect against eating these starches. Also, if you cook your starches really well—like you say, Dr. Peat, if you boil potatoes for 45 minutes to an hour—they'll be digested more easily in your stomach.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you don't actually sign up for the belief of the commensal organisms in the gut, is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, experiments with germ-free animals find they're actually healthier than the normal germ-infected animals. However, if they grow up never exposed to bacteria, they seem very healthy but never develop their immune defenses. So when they are exposed, they are extremely susceptible to infection. If we're going to live in a world with germs, we might as well get used to them.

**Andrew Murray:** When I was looking at research on endotoxin, it was always associated with E. Coli, Salmonella, or Typhoid. But our own gut bacteria can be a reasonable threat to us in terms of toxin production, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. All bacteria produce something that can be sickness-inducing. Even *Lactobacillus*, which is probably favorable, has polysaccharide material in its covering that can produce inflammation and a whole range of pathological reactions. It's really a matter of balance.

## Stress and Systemic Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** What about the research on cancer and endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's a very plausible approach. If you look at practically any degenerative disease—arthritis, gout, dementia, epilepsy, hepatitis—almost anything is crucially made worse by endotoxin. Once you get stressed, all of these things are exacerbated by the endotoxin.

**Andrew Murray:** Describe what you mean by "stressed."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a mental stress, for example, will shift the blood away from your digestive system to your legs and arms—the fight or flight reaction. If that persists or is very intense, the intestine loses its barrier function and bacteria can go right through the membrane lining the intestine into the bloodstream. Even a much lower degree of stress will begin letting the endotoxin flow in at an increased rate. So just thinking stressful thoughts will tend to increase your endotoxin absorption.

**Andrew Murray:** What you can do to help yourself can be a really simple way of improving your health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Women who were going to a fertility clinic were put on a moderate dose of penicillin or other antibiotics by a doctor who theorized their ovaries were infected. Many noticed their mood and headaches were relieved. They also became pregnant. The doctors saw that before they took the antibiotic, they had a stress level of cortisol and a very high ratio of estrogen to progesterone. Taking the antibiotic decreased the cortisol and estrogen, and increased the progesterone.

I've done the same measurements in women who had PMS and infertility. Just two or three days of eating a raw carrot salad every day caused exactly that shift of hormones: increased progesterone, decreased estrogen and cortisol. Other research shows that endotoxin alone will account for those changes. If you inject an animal with endotoxin, its estrogen will go up maybe five times higher than normal, and the progesterone and testosterone fall sharply.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA) vs. Saturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** How about endotoxins and PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids)? Is there a link?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they favor the growth of many microorganisms, but they also interact at every stage. For example, the permeability of the intestine is increased by polyunsaturated fat. One of the first reactions when a cell senses endotoxin is to produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide increases the leakiness of the intestine. If your tissues happen to be well supplied with polyunsaturated fats, the nitric oxide increases the release of free fatty acids in circulation. So, for the person who has eaten a lot of polyunsaturated fat, once a stress triggers the absorption of endotoxin, the reaction can be much more intense.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to describe for our listeners: Estrogen is a very inflammatory hormone involved in a lot of cancers. Progesterone is an anti-aging, fertility hormone. The bacteria tend to increase estrogen in relation to progesterone.

Regarding fats: Polyunsaturated fats come mainly from nuts and seeds—almond oil, sunflower, safflower, corn, soy, cottonseed. Olive oil is only about 10% polyunsaturated. The saturated fats are the ones that are antibacterial. Those include butter, coconut oil, palm oil, and animal fats from animals that haven't been eating corn and soy.

## Cancer, Atrophy, and Fibrosis

**Andrew Murray:** How about the association of cancer with endotoxin production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every level you look at is a promoting effect. There are a few positive effects of endotoxin—our long exposure builds up basic immunity, like HDL cholesterol, which is a defense against endotoxins. But reactions beyond that simple level are all pro-inflammatory and tend to stimulate fibrosis as a sign of deteriorating tissue function. Fibrosis and atrophy make the tumor harder to get at and more autonomous.

The medical establishment has convinced the public that estrogen has some anabolic protective effects, especially for preventing osteoporosis. But the overall effect of the inflammation produced by endotoxin creates a systemic age-like atrophy of all tissues. Osteoporosis is extremely sensitive to endotoxin; it activates factors that stop bone replacement and accelerate decomposition. Those atrophic processes weaken the immune system's ability to remove a cancer once it starts.

## Offending Substances: Lignins

**Andrew Murray:** Sarah, do you want to cover offending substances besides starches?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We mentioned breads, grains, beans, and flours. What other foods encourage bacterial growth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The so-called fibrous materials, many of which are promoted as health foods. Lignins—woody materials in many vegetables and grains.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Like in flaxseeds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Generally, those tend to have an estrogen-promoting effect and support the growth of bacteria.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Flaxseeds also have PUFA, so those won't be inhibiting bacterial growth like a saturated fat would.

**Andrew Murray:** I was reminded that the Dow Chemical Company was trying to incorporate lignins into bread, and they were doing research at a USDA lab to see if lignins could be a viable starch source.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they've used sawdust for many years. Cellulose is probably the safest fiber if it's a clean kind.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My friend at the USDA labs said, "If people are going to eat bread, why can't they just eat whole grain bread? Why do they have to add sawdust into it?"

**Andrew Murray:** The industry is keen to make sure there are no unsold byproducts. If something isn't naturally occurring, don't be surprised if what you're consuming is a byproduct of another industry—like the paint industry with flaxseed oil becoming a food source.

## Pediatric Crohn's Disease

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller question about pediatric Crohn's disease and a diet that would be good for that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's good to try raw carrot. It's important how you use the carrot. Just eating a raw carrot is fine, but if you're going to make a salad, it should be grated longitudinally so that you have longer pieces of fibrous material. You don't want to put it in a blender, and definitely don't want to use a juicer. The juice isn't protective, and it removes most of the fiber.

**Andrew Murray:** So that would be a starting point.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And usually having plenty of milk and cheese in the diet is protective. The bacteria that grow on milk are generally the safer type. Also, quite a few people respond well to a thyroid supplement because there's usually that typical stress pattern of high cortisol, high estrogen, and low progesterone. Thyroid helps restore the protective hormones.

**Andrew Murray:** Thyroid function can be measured by temperature and pulse before and after meals. There is a very definite pattern to how they should rise.

## Carrot Juice and the Budwig Diet

**Caller:** I have a question regarding carrots not being juiced. Many cancer diets call for a lot of vegetable juices, and carrot juice is a big one. Also, have you heard of the Budwig diet? Dr. Budwig introduced combining flaxseed oil with cottage cheese to help cells form a stronger electrical charge. Does combining flaxseed oil with cottage cheese change the bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the oldest treatments for cancer was enemas. A few hundred years ago, laxatives became a standard feature of cancer treatment. About 60 or 70 years ago, Max Gerson cured his own migraines with a change of diet. He was a famous advocate of a mostly vegetable diet, but he did use liver juice and thyroid. It was a nutritionally rational program, but he twice in his book said "absolutely no oils." His followers have changed the book, likely influenced by Johanna Budwig.

In 1954, before Budwig started writing about cancer, a Mexican professor advocated a cup of linseed (flax) oil per day as a purge to clean the intestine. When you drink that much highly unsaturated oil, the fatty acids are converted to prostaglandins and cause intense contraction of the intestine. It’s a very quick, thorough laxative. Budwig changed that to think of linseed oil as a nutritional factor. To the extent that it works as a laxative, it's likely helpful. The rest of her program was curds—cottage cheese—which is a soothing, safe diet that promotes less endotoxin than other proteins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you explain why carrot juice in particular would be lowering your good hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The carrot is so rich in carotene. When you eat it whole and raw, the fiber keeps you from absorbing almost all of the carotene. When you juice, you get sugar and minerals, but you also get a tremendous amount of carotene. Carotene works like unsaturated fats in blocking thyroid function and progesterone function.

In the early years of treating thyroid patients, doctors noticed infertile women often had a red spot in the ovary in place of the yellow corpus luteum. It was red because a tremendous amount of carotene had accumulated in it. That indicates the thyroid is unable to convert cholesterol into progesterone, and that Vitamin A, which should be used in the conversion, is blocked by the carotene.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if you eat a lot of cooked pumpkin and carrots, you could be blocking your Vitamin A receptors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person has very vigorous thyroid function and plenty of Vitamin B12, they can take care of a lot of carotene. But if you notice the calluses on your hands and feet starting to get an orange tint, that means you've got too much.

## Menopause, Night Sweats, and Borage Oil

**Caller:** I'm 50 and going through menopause. I'm having horrific night sweats. Somebody recommended borage oil. Also, I'm a vegetarian.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Highly unsaturated oils like borage have some short-range beneficial effects by blocking some immune inflammatory reactions, but that ends up being an immunosuppressive process. In the long run, it will actually increase inflammatory and stress processes.

The quickest way to alleviate night sweats and hot flashes is to increase your sugar and protein intake. Sugar lowers cortisol and adrenaline. Your protein intake should be around 80 grams of good protein. Among vegetables, potato protein is the only one that ranks up with animal proteins—it's even better than egg protein. Milk, cheese, eggs, and potatoes are high-quality proteins.

If you don't get enough sugar or starch, you use protein for energy, starving the liver. When the liver isn't functioning well, it can't store enough sugar to get you through the night. First, adrenaline surges to get sugar from the liver. When the liver is depleted, cortisol rises to turn muscle and tissue into sugar. It's the cortisol surges that cause the hot flashes. Sugary and salty foods are a quick relief.

**Caller:** So borage oil isn't good for me?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. It inhibits your ability to digest protein and inhibits thyroid function.

**Caller:** Is agave a good sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, unless it's been overheated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think most agave nectars are boiled down, so they are caramelizing the sugar. When you boil sugars down and don't filter out the caramelized portion, those are allergenic and carcinogenic.

## Protective Herbs

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I want to mention some herbs. Cascara is an herb that decreases transit time and is a laxative. If aged properly (sun-dried and aged for one year), the anthraquinones are safe and effective. Dr. Peat, tell us about the structure of tetracycline and Cascara.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a series that starts with Vitamin K. It's a quinone structure that has been studied since about 1910 as anti-cancer, antiviral, and energy-promoting. Vitamin K is now used to strengthen bones and prevent calcification of arteries. The emodin in Cascara is a three-ring substance, and tetracycline is a four-ring substance. They are all quinones intensified by adding the extra ring.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Nature has a very similar compound in Cascara as well as in Tabebuia, otherwise known as Pau d'Arco. It's antibacterial, anti-tumor, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-parasitic. Dr. Peat, you mentioned a doctor who used a decoction of that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** W.F. Koch was a Michigan chemistry professor. He proposed that we have free radicals in the form of quinones in our mitochondria handling energy. He created substances to treat cancer and viral infections. The famous Albert Szent-Györgyi based practically his whole career on working out the meaning of Koch's work with quinones. Ubiquinone (CoQ10) was later discovered in the mitochondria, proving Koch right.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Coming up to this time of year with the flu, stock up on your raw carrot salad, Cascara bark powder, and Tabebuia. Other good herbs are Echinacea, Goldenseal, Barberry, and Oregon Grapefruit.
