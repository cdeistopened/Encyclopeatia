## Introduction

**KMUD Host:** Neither Andrew nor Sarah have called in, and Dr. Peat is not answering the phone—which I hear is only for this show and he only answers when he's expecting to be on. I'm assuming that because I've done it before where Dr. Peat was here and took your calls all the time, but I'm afraid that's not going to happen tonight.

However, I do have a recording of Dr. Ray Peat from the *Strong Sistas* YouTube channel. I’ve skipped the intro because we all know and love Dr. Ray Peat and know a little of his background. If you don't, tune in next month. I'm just going to continue here; I believe they're starting to talk about foods to prioritize versus foods to potentially avoid and why.

## Essential Foods to Prioritize

**Interviewer:** If it were up to you, what are about 5 to 10 essential food items that you would recommend somebody includes in their diet? The foods that people should prioritize eating regularly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It really depends a lot on your situation, but very safe and highly nutritious foods are convenient as well as safe in the long run. Those include milk, cheese without additives, eggs, low-starch fruit, generally meat and fish that are not high in polyunsaturated fats, and—depending on your ability to digest them—well-cooked vegetables are very good for most people. What I've left out are mostly grains, legumes, and other seed-related parts such as nuts.

**Interviewer:** Would you say that the nuts, seeds, and legumes are not incorporated because of the PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not just that. Plants create a storage form of nutrients to support the embryo's development. Those nutrients have to be in an insoluble form so they don't wash away while the seed is waiting to germinate. They have to be mobilized in an organized way. Those preparations for the seed embryo go with specific defenses against those same nutrients being used by predators—such as mammals, worms, insects, or fungus.

They essentially have pesticides or insecticides incorporated into the seed chemistry. They put their most special blockers of digestion, and basically neurotoxins and digestive toxins, into the seed as self-defense because the seed is the essential, most important part of the plant. The plant can grow new leaves if a predator eats them, but the seed is the long-term existence of the plant. So, the worst toxins, as far as animals are concerned, are in the seeds.

## The Dangers of Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs)

**Interviewer:** Can you expand a little bit on PUFAs? Beyond nuts and seeds, just how do you view PUFAs influencing cells and causing insulin resistance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cold-blooded organisms—like insects, fish, and frogs—have to survive the winter. A seed also has to survive cold storage. When a seed is ready to germinate in the spring, or when a fish or insect needs to move in the cold, they have to mobilize their enzymes. There has to be mobility in the cells.

Saturated fats harden at a moderate temperature. If you put butter in the icebox, it becomes very hard. Even olive oil solidifies in the refrigerator. An animal or plant living in the north at a low temperature simply can't survive if it has saturated fats for its energy storage. In proportion to the coldness of the climate, they remove hydrogens from the fats, making them liquid at cold temperatures.

However, the degree of unsaturation—the removal of hydrogens to make them liquid oils in the cold—makes them highly oxidizable. If you increase the temperature of a fish to human temperature (98 degrees), it very quickly stinks. If you put highly unsaturated seed oil or fish oil at room temperature or body temperature, they will quickly start to harden. The oxidation spreads and hardens them into solid masses.

If an organism is going to live outside of that cold environment, they have to get rid of the polyunsaturated fats. The warmer the environment is, the more saturated their fat has to be to survive, because the highly unsaturated fats simply turn to varnish—a plastic-like material that is totally incompatible with life.

**Interviewer:** So what does that do for metabolism? What part of the cellular metabolism do PUFAs interfere with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a person eats a seed oil, the first thing it does is block the digestive proteolytic enzymes, impairing protein digestion. That's the first step in your stomach and intestine.

When it gets into the blood, if it reaches your thyroid gland, it inhibits the proteolytic enzyme needed to form thyroid hormone. Circulating in the blood, it keeps the thyroid hormones from being transported on the blood proteins. When it gets into the cells, it blocks the action of thyroid to stimulate respiration.

So, the polyunsaturated fat inhibits respiration and blocks energy production. At the same time, it starts to degrade and produce reactive oxidative fragments that are toxic to cells. The circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids also happen to intensify estrogen actions. It releases estrogen from binding proteins, making it more active, activates the estrogen receptors, and imitates the actions of estrogen. They are systematically impairing the metabolism and shifting the direction of animal metabolism.

**Interviewer:** From my understanding, PUFAs cause our fat cells to become insulin sensitive, and that's not what we want. We want our fat cells to become insulin resistant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's just one of the many consequences.

## Monounsaturated Fats: Olive Oil and Avocado

**Interviewer:** Some people have questioned the role of monounsaturated fats in the diet. How does something like olive oil or avocado compare to PUFAs versus the saturated fats you often recommend, such as coconut oil or animal fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When we eat carbohydrates in excess, we make our own saturated fats. If we are free of the polyunsaturated fats, we can modify a certain percentage of our saturated fats. We can unsaturate them midway down the fatty acid molecule at carbon number nine. This creates the Omega-9 series fatty acids. Because the unsaturation is closer to the acidic head of the molecule, it is safer from oxidation. These Omega-9s happen to be anti-inflammatory and are protective against the plant-derived Omega-3 or Omega-6 fatty acids.

**Interviewer:** So the Omega-9s—that's oleic acid, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's the major fat in avocados and olive oil.

**Interviewer:** Are the Omega-9s we get from avocado or olive oil protective, or only the Omega-9s we produce in our bodies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ones we produce in our bodies independently are purely protective and anti-inflammatory. The trouble with olive oil is that it usually contains about 10% PUFA. If you eat more than maybe one or two teaspoons of olive oil per day, you're at risk of accumulating that 10% of the highly unsaturated fat. This will build up gradually over time and offset the protective effect of the Omega-9. But if your calorie intake is fairly low and you don't overeat on olive oil, then those will be disposed of safely and the Omega-9s can be protective.

**Interviewer:** That's a really important point. Eating in a caloric surplus can amplify some of these negative consequences because these fats go into storage and build up over time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Remarkably, people are now saying almost all newborn babies are deficient in the so-called "essential fatty acids." But in fact, the newborn baby's oxidative metabolism and ability to produce energy is at an extremely high rate—much higher than ever again in life. That is exactly because of the absence of polyunsaturated fats.

If a baby eats a formula containing the so-called essential fatty acids, it very quickly starts to suppress its cellular metabolism. That accumulation of polyunsaturated fats goes on steadily and slows the metabolic rate progressively. If you look at a chart graphing the consumption of oxygen per tissue, it's at a very high point at the beginning and an extremely low point at old age and death. It is a progressive aging and energy-losing process exactly in proportion to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats.

## Fish Consumption: White Fish vs. Salmon

**Interviewer:** You mentioned fish. Are you talking about white fish, or do you have any role in your diet for fish high in essential fatty acids, such as salmon or salmon roe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salmon is terrible because of its high content of polyunsaturated fats. If you can't eat tropical fish—like in the Amazon river where the water is very warm and fish fat is just about as saturated as butter fat—then in the cold water fish, you can select those with a very low body fat content. Cod and Sole, for example, are much better than salmon.

**Interviewer:** How did the Inuits get by with very little health problems when they were eating a diet high in cold water fish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a very harmful diet. If you have a high metabolic rate and are able to oxidize the fats as fast as you eat them, they won't accumulate at a dangerous rate. But if you're fairly sedentary and tend to add a little fat every day, you're going to run into all of the accumulated pro-inflammatory oxidative conditions.

There are many people claiming that since the brain contains a high level of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, they are necessary for the brain. Yet, the baby at birth doesn't contain them, and the baby develops a fully normal, extremely functional brain without them. In fact, if you look at the brain in dementia, these polyunsaturated fats are accumulating. The whole story to promote the sale of fish oil is basically crooked. They are immunosuppressive; they knock out your white blood cell function.

**Interviewer:** Do you have any resources you would suggest for someone to read regarding the potential downsides of these "essential" fatty acids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Someone recently sent me a draft of an extremely good, very readable book on polyunsaturated fats. It has about a thousand references. It's going to be published imminently.

## The Case for Sugar

**Interviewer:** Moving on to a slightly controversial topic in the keto and carnivore community: Can you make the case for sugar? What role does sugar play in someone's diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a highly digestible starch, it quickly breaks down into glucose, and then it can provide very safe energy. But many starches are hard to digest. For someone with sluggish digestion, starches tend to support bacterial overgrowth in the intestine.

Vegetables are fine when your digestive system is working well. But if you have digestive limitations—bacterial overgrowth, slow peristalsis, or nocturnal reflux—those symptoms are made worse by starches. In that case, a low-starch fruit, such as citrus fruits, can be a perfect source of carbohydrates. You need some kind of carbohydrate to safely metabolize fats and proteins.

**Interviewer:** So sugar is just easy, fast energy that avoids digestion problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It doesn't require digestion, so it can start absorbing right in your stomach. Even if you have a perfectly digestible starch, the starch has the same quick reaction that pure glucose does—it is a powerful stimulant to insulin. If you eat a little too much glucose or starch, it activates insulin secretion and turns the excess sugar into fat. The sudden surge of insulin lowers your blood sugar, which can cause stress reactions.

The difference with sucrose—the common sugar in fruits—is that it is only 50% glucose. So, it doesn't have the glycemic reaction that a digestible starch has. It's only half as able to stimulate insulin. The fructose component of the molecule actually has a mild insulin-inhibiting effect. So, it provides sugar energy much more gradually than starch does and tends to avoid the glucose-insulin-hypoglycemia stress reaction.

**Interviewer:** A lot of anti-fructose arguments claim that because fructose doesn't spike insulin, it automatically leads to fat gain. Where are these arguments coming from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Naturally, if you overeat on fat, protein, starch, or sucrose, you're going to get fat. The anti-sugar argument really started back in the 50s. Then John Yudkin wrote a book claiming sugar turns to saturated fat, and since saturated fat causes heart disease, sugar causes heart disease. He had a doubly wrong argument.

More recently, Robert Lustig made arguments saying fructose is as toxic as alcohol. I looked up his references, and they didn't support his argument at all. In fact, fructose is a very powerful specific antidote to ethanol poisoning. Ethanol, like a high-fat diet, shifts the electronic balance of the cell metabolism in the direction of too many electrons—a "reducing state." This is the extreme of the ketogenic principle. When you starve yourself of sugar, you mobilize fat metabolism and put yourself in a high reducing state. That is the opposite of what fructose does to the cell.

**Interviewer:** Considering we came from a keto and carnivore background, what is the best way for somebody to start incorporating sugar after they have starved their bodies of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think it's a matter of having to work gradually into it. A dose of sugar, as long as it isn't grossly excessive, will be the first best antidote to the poisoning you have been experiencing in the starvation condition. Ketones derived from outside your body—like from fruits and vegetables—are protective and start the repair process of lowering stress hormones. Either ketones from vegetables and fruits or sugars are essential for getting your oxidative metabolism going again.

## Evolution and Carbohydrates

**Interviewer:** What do you say to the argument that our ancestors didn't have access to carbohydrates and relied on animal meat and fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at primates, the longest-lived in proportion to body size is the squirrel monkey. They have a pure fruit diet and live an average of 30 years. Brain development is in proportion to the amount of sugar that can be provided to the developing nerve tissue. It requires sugar energy. To develop a brain, primates had to have a relatively high carbohydrate diet. Chimpanzees don't get as much carbohydrate as the fruit-eating monkeys, and for their body size, they aren't especially long-lived or intelligent.

**Interviewer:** Is there evidence from our early lineage that carbohydrates were beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is fossil evidence. One of the African precursors of Homo sapiens lived on a type of giant grass, sort of like sugar cane, along the Nile River. They had specially developed molars for mashing the sugary juice out of this reed. Many of the arguments against this are extremely ideological; they have an idea of what they think human beings *should* be, and they shape their evidence to fit the argument.

**Interviewer:** Our environment is also very different now regarding stress, 5G, and pollution. Are our needs different now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In just the last 50 years, conditions have radically changed. In 1963, hydrogen bomb testing loaded the atmosphere with radioactive isotopes. Babies were exposed to brain-damaging amounts of radiation. We also have the vaccination mania. These environmental influences—radiation damage, for example—are amplified by polyunsaturated fats and estrogens. Estrogen and PUFAs synergize with ionizing radiation in causing tissue damage.

## Diabetes Management

**Interviewer:** What would you say to somebody who has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes? Many people go low-carb to manage these conditions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing to consider is: how was it diagnosed? You can't diagnose Type 1 without doing a blood test for insulin, but very few people actually have their insulin measured. They are treated based on blood glucose. The most common cause for high glucose is stress causing unopposed cortisol secretion. If you don't measure for insulin or cortisol, you might be doing exactly the wrong treatment.

To lower cortisol, sugar is the most powerful treatment. Doctors in France and England in the late 19th century were curing terminal diabetic patients. These patients would eat a normal meal—steak, for example—but their muscles were wasting away, and it would show up in their urine as very high glucose. When they fed them 12 ounces a day of ordinary white sugar, as well as a standard meat and potatoes diet, they recovered.

## Weight Loss Strategy

**Interviewer:** If you were about 50 or 60 pounds overweight, what would you do to lose weight?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, stop eating for a while. Then, go on a low-fat milk and cheese diet with a little bit of orange juice and an occasional egg and oyster.

Calcium and Vitamin D are supportive of the thyroid hormone. It's good to check your thyroid hormone and Vitamin D if you're overweight because a deficiency is extremely common and slows metabolism. A high PUFA intake will suppress your Vitamin D metabolism.

You want to lower the phosphate in your diet relative to calcium. Milk and cheese as the staple of your diet will tremendously increase your heat production, energy metabolism, and oxygen consumption, making it much easier to lose weight. Moderate amounts of egg, shellfish, and orange juice will provide essential nutrients.

**Interviewer:** That isn't purely focused on calories, but on nutrients. But would you say calories still matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but the difference is that a person who has been dieting will often be burning calories at a rate of only 700 or 800 per day. They get fat on just a few snacks. When you shift over to a high calcium-to-phosphate ratio, high protein relative to fat, and enough carbohydrate to handle the metabolism without stress, that will very quickly increase your calorie consumption from 700 a day up to the normal 2,000 per day. This makes it tremendously easier to lose weight. As you stay out of the stress condition, your muscles will recover, and you'll put on weight in the form of muscle as part of your ability to burn 1,500 more calories per day.

## Conclusion

**KMUD Host:** And that was the version of *Ask Your Herb Doctor* without the Herb Doctors or Dr. Peat. But I did have some Dr. Peat information for you out there. Thank you all so much for joining us.
