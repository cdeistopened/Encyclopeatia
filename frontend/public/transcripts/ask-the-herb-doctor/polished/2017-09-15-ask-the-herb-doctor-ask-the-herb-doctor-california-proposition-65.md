## Introduction: Prop 65 and Heavy Metals

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. We have a very special guest speaker with us, Dr. Raymond Peat. I know a lot of people listen purely to glimpse his insights because he always has a different answer for things.

I want to start by discussing California's Proposition 65. I briefly mentioned in July's show that I wanted to highlight some inconsistencies with Prop 65 in the California legislature. I want to outline specific testing we've done personally for products as part of our GMP protocol using ICP-MS testing for metals—specifically the California Proposition 65 metals: arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.

In 1986, California voters approved an initiative to address concerns about toxic chemicals, which became the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Prop 65. It requires the state to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. This list has grown to include approximately 800 chemicals.

While Prop 65 has prompted manufacturers to remove some harmful chemicals—like trichloroethylene in correction fluids or lead in ceramic tableware—it drastically needs reframing within realistic criteria. For example, businesses with fewer than ten employees and government agencies are exempt from these warning requirements and discharge prohibitions.

Furthermore, commonly available foodstuffs are far over the maximum allowable daily limit currently legislated by Prop 65. There isn't a single medical study that demonstrates any public health benefits of Proposition 65, nor evidence that it has lowered cancer incidence among Californians. However, it has been a bonanza for bounty hunter law firms.

Let's look at real-world examples. We periodically test our products for the "Big Four": arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. We use Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which detects levels down to parts per billion (ppb).

We tested raw turmeric root. The quantities in the raw root were:
*   Arsenic: 395 ppb
*   Cadmium: 41.9 ppb
*   Lead: 646 ppb
*   Mercury: Undetected

After extraction, the liquid extract was retested:
*   Arsenic: 68.1 ppb
*   Cadmium: Undetected
*   Lead: 6.6 ppb
*   Mercury: Undetected

We saw similar results with Lobelia and Echinacea root. Extraction typically produces a five- to ten-fold removal of these components, resulting in levels well within Prop 65 limits.

However, we also tested foodstuffs. We tested local crab from Shelter Cove:
*   Arsenic: 12,400 ppb
*   Cadmium: 10.4 ppb
*   Lead: 10.3 ppb
*   Mercury: 109 ppb

The mercury level vastly exceeds the maximum allowable daily limit set by Prop 65, given a typical 8 to 10-ounce serving.

We tested Cod:
*   Arsenic: 115 ppb
*   Lead: 30.3 ppb
*   Mercury: 473 ppb

We tested Halibut:
*   Arsenic: 602 ppb
*   Mercury: 794 ppb

Finally, a small nine-pound Salmon:
*   Arsenic: 428 ppb
*   Mercury: 72 ppb

Legislation for dietary supplement manufacturers imposes stringent limits which pale in significance when compared to seafood. The meaning of any initiative like Prop 65 has to be weighed by the freedoms lost as a result of government overreach versus common sense.

## Progesterone and Prop 65 Corruption

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, two months ago we discussed how progesterone was marginalized and demonized, and how the scientific evidence to put it on the Prop 65 list was erroneous. Do you have any thoughts on how this affects people or what the government is doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people in charge of choosing the evidence are appointed, and they are basically able to lobby for products they are associated with. When I was in contact with the agency ten years ago, three of the members were from a single university and all had conflicts of interest. One woman represented a company developing transdermal products, including hormones. Two were connected with the development of a new approach to birth control which involved the suppression of progesterone.

Supposedly, all relevant evidence relating to carcinogenicity is to be considered. However, fewer than 1% of the articles relating to progesterone and cancer were even listed. Of those, two were about a totally different substance—a carcinogenic synthetic progestin. One article cited as evidence that progesterone causes cancer was actually an attempt to refute a famous publication showing that progesterone *prevents* and cures cancer. They used a known faulty method to supposedly invalidate the evidence showing progesterone cures cancer, and the committee listed that as evidence that progesterone causes it.

It was as if the people were drunk when choosing the papers. When I asked the chairman for the names of the people who made those choices, she said they were too busy to give me that information. My impression was that it was not a regulatory agency acting in the public interest; it was promoting products on a pay-per-view basis.

**Andrew Murray:** It seems there is collusion between companies to protect vested interests. Dr. Carla Rothenberg’s PhD dissertation exposed the bad science used to deem progesterone fit for the list. It is like trying to turn an oil tanker; it takes a long time to change direction.

## Caller: Virilization and Voice Changes

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our first caller.

**Allie:** Hi, I'm from Calgary. A few years ago, I developed symptoms of androgen excess, such as hirsutism, and my voice got a lot lower. About a year later, I supplemented with progesterone after reading Ray Peat's writing. It worked wonders for many symptoms, but my voice never went back to normal. Do you think it's possible to get my singing voice back to where I can sing high notes easily again? I'm 23.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Her speaking voice doesn't sound as masculinized as many women I've known who use prescription androgens or have ovarian problems with excess androgen production. They often get voices almost as low as a male pitch.

The way androgens change the hair follicle involves a reorganization of the structure. Since the hair follicle has a finite lifespan, if you interrupt that stimulation consistently, you can re-feminize the hair. However, in the case of vocal cords, if they actually develop a male pitch, it is because the whole cartilage voice box has enlarged. If the framework holding the vocal cords has enlarged, they simply don't have a way to get smaller.

**Allie:** It happened when I was living a very toxic lifestyle, working as a waitress with no breaks, exercising 8 to 12 hours a day. I lost my high notes and developed body hair.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since your voice doesn't have a masculine quality, it's possible that the loss of high notes is the result of swelling or edema. Often, something that suppresses thyroid function will cause edema of the vocal cords. By correcting the thyroid, the water can be extruded. It would be a good idea to have your thyroid carefully checked. Check your waking temperature and pulse rate, and your mid-day temperature and pulse rate. If your TSH is not in the lower end of the normal range, a thyroid supplement might help.

**Andrew Murray:** Did you ever get your estradiol to progesterone ratio measured?

**Allie:** I had estrogen measured a while ago, around 60, but they didn't measure progesterone.

## Caller: Thyroid Supplementation and PUFA

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller.

**Jeff:** I'm from New York. I've been following the Dr. Peat diet. I'm taking 90 milligrams of natural desiccated thyroid twice a day. My morning pulse is around 60 and temperature is 97.2 to 97.8. Mid-day, the pulse is 68-69 and temperature rarely gets above 98.2. I'm in good shape. What should the pulse and temp be? Also, I've noticed an increase in male pattern baldness on the top of my head.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you ever had a blood test for TSH?

**Jeff:** Yes, it was 1.8, which I know is high. My cholesterol was 330.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have they measured the cholesterol since you've been taking thyroid?

**Jeff:** No, I'm due for another test. I suspect it will go down. Regarding PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), is it possible that being lean and muscular accelerates the detox process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In animal experiments, it takes about four years for a complete exchange when you stop eating PUFA. It takes about two years to get a 50% reduction, which is when you will start feeling your thyroid more consistently.

**Jeff:** You can't eliminate PUFA entirely. You mentioned a 4-gram limit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the inflection point where you see cancer correlating closely to the amount of PUFA in the diet is around 4 grams per day. You are safe if you keep it under that, which you can do by eating low-fat or skim milk, fruit, low-fat cheese, and eggs.

**Jeff:** I eat cooked vegetables twice a day. Should I take digestive enzymes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, if you eat vegetables, they should be thoroughly cooked. Otherwise, you can't extract the nutrients, and the carbohydrate complexes will feed bacteria.

I recommend measuring your cholesterol again and checking your vitamin D level. Sometimes a vitamin D deficiency interferes with how your body handles thyroid, leading to more reverse T3 production. Vitamin D should be around 50 nanograms per milliliter. The healthiest population regarding thyroid disease had TSH levels below 0.4. Cholesterol is a good diagnostic indicator; it should be around 200 or a little less.

**Jeff:** My cholesterol skyrocketed to 330 when I started eating a lot of ice cream and milk, but I think it was a shock to the body. Regarding my pulse and temp, if I have no symptoms, is 60-70 bpm and 98.2 degrees acceptable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wouldn't worry about it. Some people have a big heart that pumps efficiently and does fine at 65 beats per minute.

## Coffee Enemas vs. Oral Coffee

**Jeff:** One last question. Lawrence Wilson recommends coffee enemas. I know you like coffee orally, but do you have a view on coffee enemas for reducing iron toxicity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can limit iron absorption just by drinking coffee every time you eat an iron-containing food. I always have coffee with oysters, eggs, or meat.

**Jeff:** But do you have a view on the enema specifically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know some people get benefit from it, but I think you can get the same benefit, probably more, by having it with food so you don't give yourself a sudden jolt of stimulation. That is where the stress is; it can make you burn fuel so fast that you get hypoglycemia.

## Endometriosis and IUDs

**Andrew Murray:** We had a question about endometriosis and IUDs. Is there a relation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's well established that endometriosis comes from prolonged, excessive exposure to estrogen without interruption from progesterone. The mechanism of a plastic or copper IUD is to send a signal to the ovary that the uterus isn't ready for pregnancy because there is a foreign object in it. The uterus perceives this injury, and the signal travels up the fallopian tube telling the ovary *not* to make progesterone. It is a specific interruption of your hormone ratio, similar to the birth control pill.

## Caller: Recovery After Testicular Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Next caller.

**Alex:** I'm from Southern Humboldt. I'm 34. Last year I had testicular cancer, had my left testicle removed, went through chemotherapy, and had an RPLND surgery to remove lymph nodes. I haven't had a recurrence, but I'm interested in general health advice for recovery.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When experimenters remove steroid-forming tissue, it causes the pituitary to drive the remaining gland twice as hard to keep up systemic steroid production. It is important to watch your LH and FSH levels. You can reduce the stress by keeping your thyroid hormone and vitamin D levels up, regulating protein and sugar intake, and possibly supplementing pregnenolone. Pregnenolone feeds into the system, suppressing exaggerated stress reactions that are more likely if androgen is low.

**Alex:** My testosterone is actually high, around 700-750, because the remaining testicle is working double time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's good to concentrate on the whole anti-stress process because the androgen is probably compensating. DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone have a stabilizing effect. Pregnenolone is the most neutral and will help restrain LH and FSH production by the pituitary.

**Alex:** They have me on vitamin D and mushroom capsules from Fungi Perfecti. They also have me taking fish oil.

**Andrew Murray:** You want to cut the fish oil out. Definitely. That has been the mainstay of Dr. Peat's research for the last 40 years—the toxic effects of polyunsaturates. Fish oil is probably the worst of them all.

**Alex:** I was oblivious to the fact that fish oil was included in that category. Is there anything dietary you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To support the anti-stress effect of vitamin D, a high ratio of calcium to phosphorus is very helpful.

**Andrew Murray:** So cut down your meat intake compared to your dairy intake. If you eat meat, you are better off consuming bone broths, knuckle broths, and shanks.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And a little liver maybe once or twice a month.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to close it out here. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning, mate.
