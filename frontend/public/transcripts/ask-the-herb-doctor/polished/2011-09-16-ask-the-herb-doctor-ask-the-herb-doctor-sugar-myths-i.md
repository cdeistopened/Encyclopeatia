## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month’s *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

You’re invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic. It is perhaps a mixed topic, but a topic about sugar: Sugar is good for you.

We are very pleased and excited to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show to share his years of wisdom and research. He helps us understand the erroneous statements that the medical industry and the scientific community make that so easily fool us into believing what they're saying is true. We want to dedicate the show to exposing some of the myths about sugar, and especially the myths about the link between sugar, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

There is another doctor, Dr. Uffe Ravnskov, who has produced many books, one of which is *The Cholesterol Myths*. I know we're talking about sugar, but there are definite links between sugar, lipids, and the general obesity and heart disease epidemic. Dr. Peat will bring those out and show how erroneous some of the statements about sugar have been. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining us once again. I’d appreciate it if you would let people know your scientific background.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started in graduate school. I had been reading on my own, but I decided to study physiology in the biology department at the University of Oregon in 1968. Since then, I've been pretty much full-time working in physiology-related things. Reproductive endocrinology was what I did my dissertation on—how oxidative metabolism interacts with aging, estrogen, and so on to regulate fertility and sterility.

Part of that thesis work involved the aging of metabolism and how oxygen came to be wasted more and more with aging, or under the influence of stress or high estrogen. The age pigment, lipofuscin, was one of the things that I found was involved in high estrogen and aging or stress or radiation damage. Lipofuscin is a breakdown product of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), largely with other things bound into little brown lumps in the cells. It consumes oxygen and wastes energy and eventually can kill the cell. But its main function seems to be to waste oxygen and energy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And those are those little brown spots that people call age spots or liver spots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, spots on your skin. They form in the brain, on the skin, everywhere. They tend to get formed faster and faster the more stress you're under. Pretty soon, if you're under the influence of unopposed estrogen, they can just eat all the oxygen and not leave any for the cell functions. That was what really started me getting interested in unsaturated fat metabolism.

## The History of Fatty Acids and Sugar

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I did that dissertation in 1972. That was the year that John Yudkin published his book, *Pure, White and Deadly*. I read that and was so impressed by his arguments that sugar increases blood lipids, saturated fats, and cholesterol, that that was what started me on the idea of recommending increased sugar for people who are under stress.

I had already become convinced that there was no basis at all for the connection between high cholesterol, saturated fats, and atherosclerosis or heart disease. When I would see someone deficient in progesterone, having too much estrogen and age pigment, they would often recover if they could increase their cholesterol production. The simplest way to do that was to have them eat some extra sugar. That started me seeing the therapeutic possibilities of sugar.

From there I worked backwards, understanding where the lipid hypothesis had come from, and especially the doctrine that essential fatty acids are essential nutritionally. Since they are what lipofuscin is made from, it seemed increasingly important to understand how that theory came about.

I saw that George and Mildred Burr were the ones who created that idea in 1929 and 1930. In their experiment, they didn't at that time know about most of the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. They fed what they thought was a complete diet. When they eliminated the linoleic and related so-called essential fatty acids, their animals developed skin symptoms and various things that they called the "Burr disease."

Their diet used a high sugar content, a little starch, and protein casein that had been highly purified. They recrystallized the sugar and precipitated the casein to eliminate all vitamins and minerals from it, and then added what they thought were the essential nutrients. So the animals, when they removed linoleic acid from their diet, developed these scaly tail symptoms.

Three years after that, George Burr put one of his rats under a bell jar and saw that it was burning oxygen at a 50% faster rate than the rats getting the normal essential fatty acid diet. He decided that was because their skin was leaky. He said the essential fatty acids create a barrier in the skin—just making this up out of whole cloth.

The same journals where George and Mildred Burr published these ideas had already published articles by several well-known researchers showing that animals were healthier *without* fats in their diet, lived longer, and didn't get cancer. But the Burrs absolutely ignored the counter-evidence and published their doctrine. Their financiers supported them, but the world didn't pay much attention to it.

Fifteen years later, in the mid-1940s, Roger Williams' famous lab at the University of Texas had been working on discovering new B vitamins and essential minerals. They created the exact diet that Burr had fed the rats, created the so-called Burr disease, and then cured it by supplementing them with Vitamin B6.

What had happened was that on a high sugar diet, the animals were burning calories 50% faster than normal. On a terribly deficient diet, they got scaly skin largely because of a Vitamin B6 deficiency. That pretty much ruined the Burrs' scientific accomplishment.

## The Rise of Vegetable Oils

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meanwhile, the pig industry had problems with the chemical they were using to reduce feed intake, shut down thyroid function, and make pigs get fat cheaply. They found that by substituting a high polyunsaturated fat diet—soybeans and corn—they could suppress the thyroid just as well as using that toxic drug and make them get fat on a small food intake. The Burr's "essential fatty acids" turned out to be what was suppressing the thyroid.

At the same time, the seed oil industry was losing its market for extracting these unsaturated fats to use in paint and plastic manufacture. That turned the whole seed oil industry toward food. They found they could increase the sales of these extracted seed oils by promoting the idea that they were healthful for human consumption. They had been hardening them to make margarine, but by promoting their health benefits, they could sell them directly as liquid cooking oils and salad oils.

To do that, they found that a biological effect was that they lowered cholesterol production or lowered the cholesterol that appeared in the blood (causing it to increase in the liver as a defensive reaction). They created the doctrine of cholesterol as the cause of heart disease and told people to eat more of the unsaturated fats. Even though they knew that they would create obesity, as they did in the pig industry, they convinced doctors by a huge campaign that cholesterol was found in the wall of arteries that were developing atherosclerosis. Since you could lower the cholesterol in the blood, they argued that you would lower the cholesterol in the wall of the artery and prevent heart disease.

Ravnskov much later showed that none of those arguments had any evidence to support them. Atherosclerosis didn't have a direct connection to heart disease mortality. Cholesterol in the blood didn't have a connection directly with the formation of atherosclerosis. And saturated fats didn't create the cholesterol in the blood.

There was a slight backsliding in the ability to sell doctors on the idea of eating unsaturated fats to lower cholesterol. There was a study with veterans in which putting them on the liquid oil diet, eliminating saturated fats, caused more of them to die of heart disease and a lot more of them to die of cancer. So there was some problem with that lipid theory already in the 1960s.

John Yudkin came out in 1972 arguing that sugar caused heart disease because it increased cholesterol. Since I knew that cholesterol didn't have anything to do with heart disease—except protecting against it to some extent—that was where I started realizing that he was right on the issue that sugar would increase cholesterol in some people.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't the Japanese come out with a study recently that showed when they actually took off an atherosclerotic plaque, it had a cholesterol bandage over oxidized, rancid vegetable oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Cholesterol protects every cell. It's increased in the location that's being injured especially, but it's necessary for healthy cell division, DNA replication, nerve function, and learning. It's our most basic anti-stress protective substance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So those oxidized vegetable oils were damaging the arterial wall, and if the cholesterol wasn't there, it couldn't have stopped the rancidity and oxidation, and it could have caused more problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. And what starts the inflammation in the artery wall and everywhere else is the breakdown of the essential fatty acids into the free radical products and lipofuscin. You can extract lipofuscin from every arterial plaque and every degenerative tissue. You find the breakdown products, but you don't find fresh polyunsaturated fats because they're unstable; they break down quickly. What you find is the cholesterol that's there repairing the tissue, the saturated fats that didn't break down, and the lipofuscin, which is the essential fatty acid insult.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just for our listeners to understand, this unsaturated fatty acid is all liquid vegetable oils that are commonly sold and things are fried in. It also includes fish oils, omega-3 oils, omega-6 oils, flaxseed oil, and hemp seed oil. All of these are very unstable products. They can go rancid outside the body, even at room temperature. Once you ingest them, they can go rancid very quickly because we're warm and full of oxygen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In an experiment, I put a little clear plastic tube into the cork of a bottle of safflower or corn oil and put the other end in a cup of water. Sitting at room temperature, you could see the water being sucked up into the tube as the oil sitting there was consuming oxygen and becoming rancid even at room temperature. It is much faster at body temperature.

## The Myth of Toxic Sugar

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, sugar is probably the second most maligned substance after cholesterol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That guy was calling it "Pure, White and Deadly." He said that it raised the cholesterol. Well, now that they've proven that cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease and sugar raises cholesterol, that makes sugar a good guy. So what else are they saying about sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Professor Lustig at the University of California, San Francisco, in his famous lecture uses the words "toxic," "poison," and "evil." Someone counted 18 times in an hour-and-a-half lecture.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** He was referring to fructose. The sugar that's found in fruit is toxic, evil, and deadly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since sucrose is 50% fructose, he was applying it to sucrose too, or the high fructose corn syrup which is almost 50% fructose. He was saying that it's just like alcohol in being toxic to the liver. That's one of the weirdest things he said, because for many years people have been showing that fructose detoxifies many things that enter the liver, including alcohol. It can almost double the rate of destruction of alcohol and prevent liver damage in the process. Many other toxins are detoxified in the presence of fructose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about honey? Honey is mainly fructose, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About half. Honey and more purified fructoses have been used to treat diabetes, stomach ulcers, and other things. Sugar has been used to cure wounds. In emergency situations where they didn't have antibiotics, they found they could do open heart surgery and pack the wound with pure white sucrose to prevent scarring and promote healing better than the fancy antibiotics. Honey was used for thousands of years that way to cure wounds.

In the 1970s, there were many articles advocating the use of fructose in the diabetic diet because it had become economically pretty cheap. It could be added practically to anyone's diet to improve the regulation of blood glucose. But that idea goes back to 1874; someone showed that it metabolized better in diabetics than other sugars. Even earlier, in 1856 or 1857, sucrose was used to cure diabetes.

**Andrew Murray:** Why does mainstream medical science want to promote the idea that sugar is so bad for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's this momentum. They're committed to the mistaken cholesterol lipid theory of heart disease. I think Yudkin sort of tilted the scale, and all of the ranting against cholesterol and animal fat has just slid over to concentrate on sugar and fructose.

**Andrew Murray:** For people listening, a very good scientific reference is Dr. Uffe Ravnskov. He has produced about 10 books and over 80 scientific articles completely disputing the cholesterol myths. It’s a glaring example of where cholesterol has been mentioned as the evil you have to use drugs to lower, when actually it's a very protective compound. I was looking at articles citing the many antimicrobial protective effects of cholesterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same with toxins. As early as 1915 or 1920, people were showing that cholesterol would protect against toxins as well as infectious things. Ravnskov did some studies on triglycerides showing that they are also anti-infective. Other people have shown that they are anti-inflammatory.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We're told that HDLs are the good guys and you want high HDL.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're all good in the sense that they are there to protect you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But when they're in elevated levels, it's showing that there is something else wrong. Like if you're low thyroid, you can have a total cholesterol of 300.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you take alcohol or estrogen, your HDL will go up. But also if you take chlorinated hydrocarbons and other things, they'll go up.

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to sugar and the erroneous link between sugar, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same thing that Burr demonstrated—his diet was mostly plain sucrose, and his animals respired 50% faster than animals on a normal diet. That's been seen over and over. Fructose in particular, even a small amount added to a standard diet, will catalyze the oxidation of other substances, glucose and fat both. But mostly it catalyzes the use of glucose, turning it to carbon dioxide.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it helps your cells use oxygen more efficiently and respire better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. That increase is just about 30% to 50% in all of the publications where they've looked at it.

**Andrew Murray:** And the increased CO2 is also very beneficial. That's another misconception—that CO2 is bad and oxygen is good—but it's actually the other way around.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experimenters who have given a fructose supplement to diabetics see that they respond just as well or better than people without diabetes in the ability to oxidize fructose and produce energy. One group looked at the fructose that's normally present in everyone's bloodstream and compared it to diabetics. They saw that diabetics are deficient in fructose; there's almost no fructose circulating in their bloodstream. Naturally, it would be therapeutic to restore a normal level. Since they aren't able to metabolize glucose, that's apparently why they metabolize fructose to carbon dioxide even a little faster than healthy people do.

## Caller: Fish Oil and Heart Disease

**Caller:** I take Lovaza. Are you saying that stuff isn't any good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's fish oil. Well, it's better than seed oils because it's so unstable that it pretty much breaks down before it gets integrated into your tissues as much as the seed oils would.

**Caller:** So you figure I should just stop taking this stuff?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I don't know any benefit except temporarily it lowers inflammation, but that's by basically poisoning the immune system. That anti-inflammatory effect is similar to the anti-inflammatory effect of stress or radiation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They used to use radiation X-rays to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis because it suppressed the immune system. But because it's suppressing your immune system, you risk increased cancer and heart disease later in life.

**Caller:** Well, I still have heart disease. I've had four-way bypass surgery, three heart attacks, both my carotid arteries cleaned, and seven angioplasties. I'm pretty much at the end of my rope. They gave me this stuff to lower my cholesterol. The count was 203.

**Andrew Murray:** That's not high. Even by medical standards, 203 is not high. Dr. Peat is a strong advocate of papers that agree that a cholesterol higher than 200—between 200 and 250—is actually better and decreases the incidence of dementia, Alzheimer's, and other degenerative diseases.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And what the fish oil does... when someone has a cholesterol test, it just measures what's in the blood. It doesn't look at if it changes anything in the tissue level. Basically, when you take a fish oil supplement and it lowers your blood cholesterol, it actually gets deposited in other tissues, like your liver. That's not good for your liver because you could end up with fatty liver disease.

**Caller:** Oh, okay. Well, I'm going to stop taking it right now then.

**Andrew Murray:** Just make sure that your dietary intake of fats is basically butter and coconut oil.

**Caller:** We use that Country Crock mostly. Is that bad?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah, that's vegetable oil. You don't want to use that.

## Caller: Glycerin

**Andrew Murray:** What about glycerin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm sort of ambivalent about it because some research shows that it is protective and can work somewhat like fructose. But my own experience with it is that it can cause a lot of digestive irritation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is one of the protective effects of fructose that it is non-fermentable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, when you eat any free sugar—sucrose, fructose, or glucose—it is so quickly absorbed in the upper part of the intestine that you're not feeding sugar to bacteria, because the intestine should be pretty sterile in the upper part.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. We were just talking to a winemaker who said that if you want to make mead from honey, you have to heat the honey to break down the fructose and dilute it, otherwise honey is not fermentable. That's why it can last thousands of years without going bad.

## Caller: Sugar, Lyme Disease, and Cancer

**Caller:** I'm very interested in Dr. Peat's attitude towards sugar. I have Lyme disease, and when I have any actual sugar from sugar cane, my affected joint hurts immediately. I can have honey or maple syrup and it doesn't affect it. I'm also very interested in the relationship between sugar and cancer. I've been reading this anti-cancer diet book by a French physician who says that sugar is a great promoter of cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a whole topic in itself. If you look at the blood sugar in an animal or person carrying a tumor, their blood sugar generally is at least normal. Even if they don't eat any sugar, they'll still keep their blood sugar at about the same level.

There have been many attempts to starve the cancer by lowering the blood sugar. But the tumor is sending out signals to provide sugar, protein, amino acids, and fatty acids that it needs to grow. If you cut off the sugar supply, all it does is send out more stress signals to increase cortisol production to break down your tissues. The cachexia, or tissue wasting, that is the worst feature of cancer is usually produced by the stress hormones converting your protein and fat tissues into food for the cancer.

One experimenter treated tumors of the leg. Since the circulation could be isolated, they put a high concentration of glucose into the artery feeding this tumor. It killed the tumor without hurting the healthy tissue, because the tumor has such an unlimited appetite for anything that it will eat itself to death.

In vitro, if you feed unsaturated fats to cancer cells, they'll eat themselves to death. But in the body, the unsaturated fats are under control; other tissues will consume them and be injured. You can't do anything but stimulate a cancer with the unsaturated fats. But with a high concentration of sugar, experimenters showed that sugar would be consumed to the point that it would kill the cancer.

**Caller:** But I'm interested in the fact that sugar makes my affected ankle with Lyme hurt terribly, but honey and maple syrup don't. I find that very curious.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sucrose is the main ingredient in maple syrup, and the balance of fructose and glucose in honey is approximately the same. So it must be the other ingredients that are having the effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There are some minerals in maple syrup, and honey definitely has more than just fructose and sucrose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was one of the things that Yudkin used for his argument that fructose was poison. He said that it wasn't the absence of minerals and vitamins in the white sugar that made it poison. He believed that he knew what all of the nutritional requirements were. He said that the difference in the known nutrients between molasses and white sugar were so trivial that it couldn't be that white sugar and white bread were causing nutritional deficiencies. It was just that they were poison.

**Caller:** Well, my parents ate astounding amounts of white sugar and they both lived into their 90s in reasonably good shape.

## Caller: Glycemic Index and Starches

**Caller:** I'm hearing there is a difference between fructose and white processed sugar. I feel differently when I eat pure white sugar versus honey or maple syrup. I think an overload of white sugar—pure sucrose without any fructose—is the culprit. I know that insulin will take sugar and store it as fat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you're actually looking at glycemic indexes, the glycemic indexes of some potatoes and rice are almost double that of white sugar. Fructose has a lower glycemic index than sucrose. But pure white sugar is not the guy that causes obesity and heart disease. Sure, if you eat enough of anything, you're going to get increased weight gain.

**Caller:** So you're saying that white rice and white potatoes have a higher glycemic index than white sugar?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yes, some potatoes and white rices are almost double that of white sugar.

**Caller:** I pretty much stay away from white rice. I like brown rice and whole grains.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** All the grains, starches, and beans have a higher glycemic index than fruits, honey, and white sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar increases your ability to burn fat by 30% to 50%. So you can eat much more of the sucrose without getting fat.

**Caller:** What about ice cream that's mixed with mostly fats?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There's no starch there. It's the fat in the cream.

**Caller:** I believe in fructose. When I drink fruit juice, I dilute it with half water so I'm not getting too much.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you have fruit sugar or any sugar, you should have it balanced with a fat and a protein so you slow release the sugar. This allows your liver to store it and use it for longer, rather than a huge spike of sugar that pumps out insulin and gets stored as fat.

## Caller: Leptin and Appetite

**Caller:** I've heard that high fructose corn syrup blocks a chemical signal called leptin that goes to the brain when you've had enough food, causing people to want to eat more. Is this true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pharmaceutical industry was hoping to promote leptin as a natural anti-obesity chemical when they discovered it limited appetite. But as it has developed over the last 12 years, it turns out that leptin is produced when you overeat, especially on fat. It is produced by fat cells, especially in obese people.

When you have a lot of it, it does shut off your appetite, but it also happens to activate inflammatory processes. For example, in breast cancer, it's found to be the signal that turns on the cancer metabolism called aerobic glycolysis, where the cancer burns sugar at a high, inefficient rate. So leptin turns out to be one of the means by which obesity causes its damage. Rather than being some mysteriously wonderful protective molecule, it gets out of whack in fat people and causes harmful effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So leptin is the bad guy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And it happens that fructose suppresses it relative to other foods.

## Hypothyroidism and Low Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** Just as a quick aside, most people listening are probably conscious enough not to drink artificially sweetened sodas. But things like saccharin cause allergic reactions, sucralose has nothing like it in nature, and acesulfame K contains methylene chloride. They are all bad.

**Engineer:** I have a question for someone with hypothyroidism and low cholesterol. What could the link be there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably eating too much starch. That's the commonest cause of that pattern. Fructose in particular acts very much like T3 (active thyroid hormone). Both glucose and fructose increase the conversion of the inactive thyroxine (T4) to the active T3. They do several things to increase thyroid activity, lowering the stress hormones. The energy provided by both the glucose and the T3 in the liver will give it the energy to produce the cholesterol that's needed—if you're eating enough sugar and not producing toxins in your intestine by eating hard-to-digest fibrous starchy foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they could replace their starchy carbohydrates—breads, grains, beans, rice—with fruits and honey in combination with protein. That would help their liver increase thyroid hormone as well as increase their cholesterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And all of the sugary fruits come with a very high concentration of potassium and other minerals that help to metabolize the sugar in a safe way so you don't turn it to fat.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. For those who want information on Dr. Raymond Peat, his website is raypeat.com. There is a big list of fully referenced scientific articles disputing things that most of us have been brainwashed to believe. Also, look up Dr. Uffe Ravnskov regarding cholesterol myths. Thank you so much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
