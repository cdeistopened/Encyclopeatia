## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who have never listened to the shows, I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

Dr. Raymond Peat has become a firm fixture on our monthly shows, and we are very happy to have his wisdom. Thank you for joining us again, Dr. Peat. For those who have not heard of you, could you give us a résumé of your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I taught in several areas. My first teaching job happened to be biology oriented towards physics majors, but I also taught literature and painting. I decided to concentrate on biology and physiology, intending to concentrate on the brain because of my interest in language. However, because of the doctrinaire nature of the nerve biology people, I went into reproductive physiology and aging. That happened to be a specialty of Professor Soderwall in particular, but several of the physiology people were interested in age-related changes. That is what I did my dissertation on in 1972.

## Preeclampsia and Nutrition

**Andrew Murray:** I have several questions to pose to you before we open up the lines. One person has a young friend in the hospital with preeclampsia. The doctors want her to abort the baby because her blood pressure spikes up and down. She is at 24 weeks and refuses to abort. She is very health conscious and is eating her own food while in the hospital. What is your general impression of preeclampsia and the best approach to its treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I first became interested in biology, I saw that preeclampsia was one of the most dogmatic areas of medicine. Until fairly recently, about 30 years ago, almost all doctors were taught that it is a genetic-related disease. The idea was that the mother's nutrition had nothing to do with the development of the baby.

Tom Brewer, a medical doctor who actually studied nutrition, was instrumental in gradually changing that medical dogma over a period of 30 years. Two people influenced by him were Douglas Shanklin and Jay Hodin, who wrote a book about 40 years ago called *Maternal Nutrition and Child Health*.

Tom Brewer found that having women salt their food to taste, drink at least a quart or two of milk a day, and definitely get 80 grams or more of protein per day was effective. He noted that the medical treatment at the time—restricting salt—was based on the idea that blood pressure in anyone with hypertension could be controlled by restricting salt. This was promoted by the drug industry when they released diuretics. That unscientific application to preeclampsia was killing babies and causing defects by starving their brains and reducing blood volume.

Shanklin and Hodin cited studies where the only intervention was supplementing several grams of sodium extra a day. Those studies showed that just increasing salt intake was enough to correct the blood pressure by increasing the volume of fluid and blood, allowing for proper oxygenation of the fetus. With proper oxygenation, the kidney could regulate the production of aldosterone. Salt restriction increases aldosterone, which increases blood pressure.

**Andrew Murray:** So the current recommendations are almost the exact opposite of what is needed. The basic idea is to increase the protein content of the mother's diet, increase salt intake, and increase calcium and vitamin D. What do you think is the best source of protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk, cheese, eggs, and among the vegetables, potatoes are the best protein.

## Aortic Valve Stenosis and Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** I have another question regarding aortic valve stenosis. A 30-year-old male friend has had this condition for some time, and doctors think he needs surgery soon. What causes this narrowing of the valve?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fibrous tissue replaces the normal elastic tissue with aging in general, but inflammation can accelerate it. Stress and inflammation in a particular area will stimulate the production of too much collagen—an overgrowth of fibrous tissue. This happens in the heart when it is being overworked or undernourished. The valve is an area constantly being stretched and stressed.

One of the mediators of inflammation that can be triggered just by stretching is serotonin. People who have an intestinal disease that overproduces serotonin very often have valve fibrosis and narrowing of the blood vessels. Avoiding intestinal irritation will lower the exposure to serotonin in all tissues and especially protect the heart. Some drugs that increase both serotonin and dopamine happen to intensify the production of fibrous tissue.

**Andrew Murray:** Are you talking about SSRIs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in particular, those are the worst.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this serotonin produced within the cells of the valve, or is it a systemic component?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nearly all the body's serotonin is produced in the intestine. With a bad diet, those cells multiply. In the average person, about 95% of our serotonin comes from the intestine, is carried in the platelets in the bloodstream, and is detoxified in the lung. However, with overwork or inflammation, the lining of the circulatory system can be overexposed to serotonin.

Hormonal situations that cause you to hyperventilate and not retain enough carbon dioxide will cause the platelets to dump their serotonin. Diabetes, which is a failure to oxidize sugar properly, turns sugar to lactic acid. Lactic acid displaces carbon dioxide, and the loss of carbon dioxide causes serotonin exposure.

**Andrew Murray:** Could you measure serotonin on the breath as a marker of stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since serotonin acts partly through the stimulation of nitric oxide, and nitric oxide is a gas, it is easy to see in the breath. They are analyzing a person's health just by measuring the amount of nitric oxide in the breath.

**Andrew Murray:** Am I misguided in thinking of nitric oxide as a vasodilator?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are other ways to dilate blood vessels safely. Keeping your carbon dioxide up suppresses free radical damage and relaxes the blood vessels in proportion to the amount of circulation needed. Nitric oxide is produced under irritation. When you get vasodilation from scratching your skin—a red flare—that is largely nitric oxide release from mast cells.

## Cholesterol and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** I keep getting questions about cholesterol because there is such entrenched dogma surrounding it. Doctors seem convinced that LDL versus HDL is the main problem. Why is lowering cholesterol artificially a bad idea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s, the seed oil industry knew there was an inverse relation between eating a lot of unsaturated oil and cholesterol levels. They used that to sell their oil. While it does lower cholesterol, it is probably a toxic effect on the liver.

When the body senses stress, the liver and intestine increase their production of cholesterol because cholesterol is the precursor for the protective hormones DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone. If you are poisoned, your body produces more cholesterol to produce these defensive hormones. It has been demonstrated that if you inject cholesterol intravenously, it is an antidote for everything from arsenic to cobra venom. It protects every cell in the body at every imaginable level, from the stability of chromosomes to the cell membrane.

**Caller (New Jersey):** I'm floored by what you just said. Where would one get injectable cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is just for experiments. However, you can increase your cholesterol by optimizing your nutrition. Orange juice is a very practical way to increase your cholesterol if it is low. Some sugars, such as orange juice, will usually bring it up to normal.

## Magnets and Bioregeneration

**Caller (New Jersey):** Can magnets be used for bioregeneration? If yes, how can we use them effectively?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1960s, I read about a Russian researcher, Yuri Holodov, who demonstrated that the gonads and the brain are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields. I went to Russia to talk to him. He gave me an amazingly complete bibliography.

I found that there was a good foundation for biological sensitivity to magnetic fields. Madeleine Barnothy and her husband wrote one of the books Holodov referred me to. My American professors had never heard of the field. Solco Tromp, a Dutchman who invented the field of medical biometeorology, was also aware of this sensitivity. His work on the nervous system likely gave computer scientists the idea of how to use liquid crystals in display systems. He was 30 or 40 years ahead of most technologists.

## Serotonin and Depression

**Caller (Arcata):** I'm confused. You say serotonin is not beneficial, but we hear that it's good for thinking happy thoughts. Why do people taking Prozac think they aren't depressed anymore?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My website has articles on the history of serotonin. In the 1960s, they realized it was an antagonist to LSD. The government demonized LSD, and the drug industry took advantage of that, implying that if LSD makes you crazy, its antagonist, serotonin, must be the "good guy." Before that, studies on intestinal tumors that overproduce serotonin showed that psychosis, aggression, and anxiety were outstanding features of the state caused by excess serotonin.

Regarding Prozac, besides increasing exposure to serotonin, the beneficial effects seem to come from other things they do. The irritation in the brain increases the production of steroids like brain progesterone and pregnenolone. The mood lift comes when your brain progesterone increases.

## Crohn's Disease and Opiates

**Caller (Garberville):** I have Crohn's disease and have had multiple surgeries, leaving me with a short intestine. Slowing my bowel down to assimilate food is a major problem. The only thing that works is opiates. I have no side effects. Do you think I should stick with this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It sounds like you have adapted very well to the opiates. Have you had thorough hormone tests?

**Caller (Garberville):** Yes, my blood levels seem fairly in balance. I take liquid B complex, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and blackstrap molasses for minerals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How much calcium and magnesium are you getting?

**Caller (Garberville):** I eat two half-pints of yogurt every day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What about cheese as a source of calcium?

**Caller (Garberville):** I didn't know teas contained that much calcium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat is suggesting *cheese* for calcium.

**Caller (Garberville):** Oh, cheese. I didn't know that. I will look into it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin K and Vitamin D would help you retain calcium. Coffee is also a good source of magnesium.

## Vitamin K and Blood Pressure

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** I wanted to clarify the "tea" for calcium—it was cheese, okay. Is there something to regulate blood pressure that fluctuates high and low?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All the minerals we've been talking about—fruit juice, well-cooked green leaves, cheese, and milk—help. Vitamin D and Vitamin K help regulate calcium and magnesium. A big dose of Vitamin K, now available in oily form, can correct osteoporosis and take calcium out of the blood vessels, which tends to correct hypertension. By regulating energy metabolism, it might even help prevent episodes of low blood pressure. It works with Coenzyme Q10 to maintain oxidative metabolism.

**Andrew Murray:** Why are doctors so against Vitamin K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were taught in medical school that "K" stands for "clot" and that taking it increases blood clotting. However, the clotting system is incredibly complicated. Two essential factors, Protein C and Protein S, prevent abnormal coagulation, and you cannot make them without Vitamin K.

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** What is a big dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know people who used around 50 milligrams per day. One person with blood pressure of 220/70 saw it drop to 140/70 in two or three weeks.

## Vitamin K with Blood Thinners

**Caller (Philipsville):** I am taking Pradaxa for atrial fibrillation. I was told Vitamin K thins the blood and might be too much with a blood thinner.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have never heard of that. It is good to have your blood clotting system checked periodically if you are taking a Warfarin-type drug, but Vitamin K helps regulate calcium in all systems. It puts it into your bones and keeps it from going into your arteries.

## Sugar and Inflammation

**Caller (Philipsville):** Dr. Oz said sugar causes inflammation. What do you say to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The combination of sugar and insulin is definitely anti-inflammatory. Traditionally, packing plain white sugar into an injury facilitates healing and prevents scar formation.

A diabetic is unable to oxidize sugar. Diabetes and hypoglycemia have in common the promotion of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide. The normal use of sugar is definitely anti-inflammatory.

**Caller (Philipsville):** People tell me I drink too much fruit juice because of the sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Juices always have minerals, especially potassium. Experiments showed that potassium was more involved in handling glucose effectively than insulin was. Since fruit juice has a lot of potassium, you don't need nearly as much insulin to handle the sugar. Eating a piece of bread is much more disturbing to your insulin and blood sugar system than drinking a similar number of calories as fruit juice.

**Caller (Philipsville):** So to limit calories, it would be better to limit carbohydrates/starches and keep the juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, juices are basically more nutritious than starches.

**Andrew Murray:** I'm afraid we have to end there. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for your time. For those listening, Dr. Peat's website is www.raypeat.com. It is full of fully referenced scientific material.
