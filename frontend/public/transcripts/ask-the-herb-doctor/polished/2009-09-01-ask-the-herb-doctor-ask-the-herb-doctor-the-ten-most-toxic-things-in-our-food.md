# Ask Your Herb Doctor: The 10 Most Toxic Things in Our Food

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you and welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice. This month we are again very pleased and fortunate to welcome Dr. Ray Peat back to this show. We'll be discussing the 10 most toxic things in our food. Welcome to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*, Dr. Ray Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hello. Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** I think I should start by asking you to mention your academic background for those people who perhaps have never heard you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I used to teach linguistics and literature, but I got interested in nutrition and other parts of biology, endocrinology, and such. So I went back to graduate school in 1968 and got a PhD, taking most of my coursework in biochemistry and reproductive physiology. It's mostly endocrine chemistry that I've been studying ever since.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So for the last 45 years, Dr. Peat has been doing nutritional counseling in reproductive physiology and hormones. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I was doing it somewhat in the early 60s, just from what I could learn incidentally, without actually taking coursework in it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We have a very experienced nutritionist, physiologist, and endocrinologist joining us tonight. We're very happy to have you on our show.

## Ingredient Labeling and "Meat Glue"

**Andrew Murray:** We wanted to go over the 10 most toxic things in our food. Incidentally, probably 50% of our interaction with clients is based on modifying their diet—getting them to cut out foods that are negatively impacting their health and switch to foods that positively affect it. The other 50% is herbs. The adage "you are what you eat" is very appropriate.

In England, there are very descriptive ingredients on all the foods you buy. It almost seems ridiculous sometimes because there is so much information about the ingredients that it covers up the advertising. But it lets people know exactly what is in the product; everything has to be disclosed. Tonight, we will cover 10 products known to cause disease or symptoms leading to disease. These are easy to spot on packaging in England, whereas in America, legislation allows for the non-disclosure of certain ingredients.

One of the main things that has come to light is the ever-increasing processing agents used in foods. Food can basically be broken down into a soup, re-homogenized, put into molds, pressed, and formed. This is becoming an art—not for the sake of being creative, but for selling a product and turning non-edible food into apparently edible food.

The transglutaminases are a group of compounds that are basically "meat glue." These are agents that bind meats together. Dr. Peat, would you talk a little about the transglutaminases and their negative impacts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Celiac disease has been pretty much explained as an overlap between part of the gluten protein molecule and a natural enzyme that we have in all of our cells and systems: transglutaminase, which sticks proteins together. This enzyme is induced by lots of things to increase or decrease its quantity.

For example, ACE inhibitors for treating blood pressure have been discovered to block it to the extent that people's skin can fall off—the epidermis separates, forms blisters, and comes loose because of inhibiting the transglutaminase. But other things can intensify the action. Estrogen, for example, will cause premature hardening of the epidermis. The cells are flattened and keratinized under the influence of estrogen, which is antagonized by vitamin A.

The uterus, the skin, and the breast are places that especially involve these interactions of the hardening enzyme. Breast cancer and uterine cancer contain very large amounts of overproduction of certain kinds of transglutaminase. The antibody reactions involved in celiac disease can inactivate the natural enzyme when it occurs. For example, scleroderma—the hardening and calcification of the skin and other membranes—can apparently overlap considerably with celiac disease involving over-activation of the transglutaminase enzyme.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you say that being related to estrogen, females would be at greater risk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, all of the autoimmune diseases are much more frequent—five or ten times for some of them—in women compared to men. I'm not sure how big a role transglutaminase plays in those, but that is one enzyme that is very susceptible to forming autoantibodies under the influence of estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** Typically, what kind of foods will contain larger than normal amounts of these transglutaminases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The worst thing about the use of these products is that they are industrially manufactured in genetically modified microorganisms. For about 30 years now, organisms have been used for modifying foods. When the Japanese pioneered the genetic modification of microorganisms to produce amino acids, people thought they were buying a pure chemical substance. But I ran across many people who believed they almost died when they took a pure amino acid preparation. It's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to thoroughly purify anything made in a microorganism to the extent that it won't be allergenic. So the worst thing is that you're getting junk from microorganisms and industrial processes.

**Andrew Murray:** And these can't be removed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far as I know, it's impossible to absolutely purify them. But they purify them enough to satisfy government regulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they're taking bacteria, fungi, and yeast, and genetically engineering them to produce various chemicals. The transglutaminases are one of these things produced through genetic modification.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And they're becoming more and more popular with restaurant chefs to prepare things individually.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That was a very interesting article you sent us talking about chefs wrapping chicken with bacon. If they just applied a little bit of this meat glue, the bacon conveniently stuck to the chicken breast without skewers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're getting very skillful. Soybean protein can be shaped, modified, and glued together to resemble the fibrous texture of meat. Scraps salvaged from the slaughterhouse can be glued together to look like meat. They can form it so that it looks like specific lamb chop cuts, pork chops, or rib steaks. They are very convincing copies.

**Andrew Murray:** They don't want to waste anything.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably where most people are exposed to the transglutaminases would be in the chicken or fish chunks that are very neatly formed to a certain shape. Or in delicatessens, they have so-called roast beef or roast turkey that comes in very symmetrical tubes or loaves.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Fortunately, in California, we are blessed with a lot more natural food stores, but these delicatessen meats are still very prevalent.

**Andrew Murray:** So basically, the pressed meats. Any meat in a delicatessen that's been pressed into a certain shape.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think some of the loaves that have been around for 100 years or more, for example, head cheese made with natural gelatin, would be fine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to recap on these transglutaminases: they are something our body manufactures naturally and have a purpose, but when we take them in increased numbers through these processed foods, that is when it starts to cause the problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Everything that we eat or inhale is processed by our immune system, sampling things that hit the intestinal membranes or leak through the membrane into the bloodstream. The immune system has to decide what to do with these extraneous materials. It can either accept them and allow them to circulate, or it can organize a defensive attack against them. It's the defensive inflammatory attack against extraneous materials, such as microorganism proteins, that can trigger sometimes deadly allergic reactions.

It isn't strictly the proteins. The immunologist doctrine used to say that proteins are the allergens, but many carbohydrates or starch-like gum materials are extremely allergenic. That has actually been known for 60 or 70 years, though allergists are just now barely accepting the fact.

## The Benefits of Gelatin

**Andrew Murray:** Before we move on, Dr. Peat, could you mention the health benefits of gelatin? We mentioned the pressed meats using transglutaminase where gelatin was traditionally used.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gelatin constitutes about 50% of the protein in an animal. It has the feature of lacking tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. Muscle meats are extremely rich in tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine, and those happen to inhibit thyroid function, suppress metabolism, and promote inflammation.

Simply eliminating methionine from the diet in animal experiments has increased the maximum lifespan by about 40%. Adults have an extremely low requirement for tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. They are used for growth processes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's very important for children.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they're essential for kids to grow up. But once you've achieved your growth, you just need a very small amount to make new skin, antibodies, intestinal membranes, hair, and nails. You don't need the vast quantities that we get in the ordinary average proteins. 40 or 50 years ago, nutritionists wondered how "little old ladies" could be so healthy just eating gelatin and toast because they thought of tryptophan and cysteine as essential amino acids. But old people can essentially live on it with just a trace of the others in things like bread and fruit.

**Andrew Murray:** I think there is conditioning that gelatin is a bad product because it's created from animal parts. But actually, gelatin is extremely important.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Traditional diets made very efficient use of things like chicken feet, pigs' ears and tails, beef and pork skin, and so on. It is really very pleasant and nutritious food.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And there have been studies showing the anti-cancer effect of gelatin as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, anti-aging and anti-inflammatory. It was used medically very widely up until about 50 years ago.

## Citric Acid and Ascorbic Acid

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to the next additive: citric acid and ascorbic acid. These are common ingredients found in juices, especially orange juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started running into people who had mysterious allergies in Eugene, Oregon. They tended to start with the pollen season and continue with the grass seed field burning in the late summer. But I found that some people had year-round allergies and were consistently taking all of the anti-allergy supplements: pantothenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin C, and so on. I suggested they try stopping those for a while to see what happened. I got essentially 100% results in curing the local allergies.

That was when I started doing a lot of nutrition counseling because everyone was so surprised to see that they had been allergic to the supplement, specifically ascorbic acid. That caused me to investigate the history of it.

In 1953, when I worked in the woods, the word went around that you could cure poison oak with ascorbic acid. I tried it myself, and in just two or three days, I completely recovered from a horrible case of poison oak and never caught it again. At that time, it was very expensive to make, and the pills on sale were only 50 milligrams.

Several years later, they developed new ways of manufacturing it. One of the processes Linus Pauling described as the "lead room" for making sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is slightly contaminated with lead and other heavy metals. Then corn starch is oxidized with this industrial sulfuric acid and ends up as ascorbic acid containing quite a bit of heavy metal. With these new methods, I found that when people were taking 500 or 1,000 milligrams, they would often develop cold symptoms when they took it. It apparently is irritating enough to the intestine that it causes endotoxin absorption and inflammation of the nose, throat, and chest membranes.

Citric acid is manufactured by very similar methods to ascorbic acid. They really shouldn't be considered to have anything to do with natural ascorbic acid or citric acid. A person who can get very sick on 2 milligrams of synthetic ascorbic acid can eat 4,000 milligrams of natural ascorbic acid with no reaction at all.

**Andrew Murray:** Even though they might call it the same product, the industrial manufacture produces a very different thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One researcher dissolved a 500-milligram tablet of commercial ascorbic acid in a liter of water and then put it in a machine that measures free radicals. He said it was like a storm of free radicals. It was equivalent to something like 100 rads of X-rays to produce that many free radicals in the water.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And here people are taking vitamin C for its antioxidant effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He said it shows what tremendous antioxidant systems we have in our stomachs that we don't all die with the first 500-milligram dose.

## Gums and Mucilages

**Andrew Murray:** How about the gums? We see things like guar gum, locust bean gum, carob bean gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan, and agar-agar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was reading the Encyclopedia Britannica yearbooks from 1947 or so, and I saw that the FDA had declared that they were so allergenic they shouldn't be considered fit for use in foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And now they're in everything. Most ice creams, cottage cheese.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Practically everything. They haven't figured out a way to get it into fresh eggs and oranges yet. Surprisingly, even organic foods sometimes don't have to list things like sulfites on the labels, but I think they do have to list carrageenan. It can be in the food as a gum thickener and still be called organic.

Not long ago, there was a publication of a person who died from anaphylactic shock after having an alginate dental impression made.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they're very allergenic because an alginate would be like the agar-agar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the dental school at the University of Kansas, students were practicing making alginate impressions on each other. Out of 227 students, close to 50 developed blisters in their mouth that took about five days to clear up. So just contact can create blisters in 20% of people, and for occasional unlucky people, it can kill them.

**Andrew Murray:** So these are basically the thickeners. We find them in ice cream, whipping cream, cottage cheese, bread products, cookies, and tortillas.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even if it doesn't say it on the label, that doesn't mean it's not in there. A lot of processed foods have them.

## Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs)

**Andrew Murray:** Let's mention PUFAs, the polyunsaturated fatty acids. That's a pretty big problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In natural foods, I think there are two or three naturally occurring substances that account for some natural disease and possibly all of the major degenerative diseases. Those are polyunsaturated fats, starches, and sometimes an excess of iron.

If you ate liver every day accompanied by orange juice, you would absorb a toxic amount of iron. But just over the period of several years, you can see the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissue. Old animals have highly polyunsaturated brain tissue. Long-lived animals that are remarkable for living longer than you would expect are unusually saturated in their fats.

**Andrew Murray:** You'll find these polyunsaturates in corn oil, soy oil, and fish oils to some extent. These are used as frying oils for chips or french fries. Dr. Peat, mention some of the conditions that they can lead to.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Arthritis, cancer, dementia, wrinkly skin, and susceptibility to sunburn. An article that just came out two months ago looked at the pigment epithelium in the retina. They found that linoleic acid in particular, but all of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, created an inflammatory process that basically accelerates the degeneration of the retina. A new article showed that stearic acid or saturated fatty acids don't do that.

For many years, researchers on alcoholic liver disease have been showing that it's the polyunsaturated fats which cause cirrhosis and hepatitis when people drink alcohol. In India, alcoholics who are in the butter, ghee, and milk-eating regions don't get cirrhosis.

**Andrew Murray:** So the cirrhosis is not apparent at all in those people? It's purely those people that would consume alcohol in the presence of polyunsaturated oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A group led by a man named Nanji has demonstrated that saturated fats can basically cure alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatitis.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even in the presence of them continuing to drink.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Someone did allow them to drink a quart of vodka every day, and they still recovered when they had their saturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To recap, naturally occurring saturated fats are butter, coconut oil, palm oil, beef and lamb fat, and cocoa butter. The polyunsaturated fats include sesame seed oil, nuts and seeds in high quantities, and corn and soy oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And chickens and pigs if they're fed on a high corn and soy diet. Their fats will be representative of what they were eating.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even our eggs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They used to talk about the high saturated fat and cholesterol content of eggs, but about 30 years ago, someone decided to reanalyze and found that at that time they were already almost purely polyunsaturated.

## Starches and Persorption

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, you categorized three toxic things in our foods naturally occurring: polyunsaturates, starches, and excess iron. Let's talk about starches.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A man named Gerhard Volkheimer, an immunologist in Berlin, tested on his medical students by having them drink a solution of corn starch or potato starch stirred into water. He would draw a blood sample periodically. Within about 10 or 15 minutes of drinking the starch solution, you would find a lot of the unprocessed starch pellets in the bloodstream—the same size they were when ingested. In some of these starches, the diameter of the starch grain is as much as 100 microns across, 10 times as wide as the cells that line the intestine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So how did it get through?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The process is called persorption. Basically, they are pressed on one side and they pop out the other side. The cells are much more flexible than people imagine. Since the capillaries are just a few microns across, and a red cell at 10 or 11 microns has to bend a little bit to get through, the starch grains can get stuck. The bigger ones will plug the arterioles before they get to the capillaries.

Volkheimer fed a high starch diet to mice and then sliced them up. He found that every organ contained areas where cells had been killed by plugging up an artery with ischemia, and that it accelerated the aging process by killing areas in the heart, brain, and kidneys.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's causing heart disease then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically. In his medical students, after the first 15 to 30 minutes, he tested the urine and found that the same unprocessed starch grains were showing up in the urine, right through the kidney organelles. Somewhat later, he found it in the bile. About an hour later, he could find it in the cerebrospinal fluid.

## Caller: Allergies in Children

**Caller:** I have a 13-year-old daughter who has allergies. We eat pretty well, mostly organic. Her symptoms are a stuffy nose and sometimes bumps on her face or legs. She tested positive for Johnson grass, molds, and sensitivities to wheat, dairy, and corn. The dairy seemed to make her stuffed up, and the corn and wheat generated the bumps. These allergies started to manifest between 6 and 8 years old.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With allergies, it's similar to autoimmunity, except not so serious. Estrogen begins to rise, especially in girls but in boys too, around the age of seven or eight. The estrogen changes the immune function; it tends to shrink the thymus gland and increase antibody production without the guidance of the thymus cells. That seems to be why it predisposes to allergies, asthma, and autoimmunity.

Asthma is now very well recognized to be increased by birth control pills, menopausal estrogens, or even the cyclic premenstrual rise in estrogen. Partly that's the effect of lowering the blood sugar, because if your blood sugar falls, the immune cells become much more reactive.

An experimenter ranked food allergens. If he lowered the animal's blood sugar with insulin to 50% of normal, the mildest allergens could kill the animals. But if he infused glucose while exposing them to even the worst allergens, the worst allergens might give them the sniffles, but nothing worse. So just increasing glucose or decreasing it can make a total difference in your sensitivity. Since thyroid and progesterone are the main things that allow your liver to store adequate glycogen, and estrogen interferes with that, that's why the sensitivities come on around puberty.

**Andrew Murray:** That's probably another misconception—that sugar is bad for you. Just say a little bit more about sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** White sugar was already being blamed for causing diabetes 150 years ago. The treatment for diabetics was to absolutely forbid sugar, which was a completely crazy idea. A French and an English doctor said that if they're losing a pound of sugar per day in their urine, they're surely going to die sooner if they don't eat any sugar. So he fed them up to 12 or 14 ounces of sugar—the best white granulated sugar he could buy—and he cured his patients just by feeding them as much sugar as they were losing. The process of washing it eliminates most of the allergens. So the finest white sugar is really one of the safest foods available.

## Caller: Coconut Oil vs. Coconut Milk

**Caller:** I have questions about coconut oil. Could you explain the difference between coconut oils and coconut milks regarding health effects? Also, do you have suggestions for recipes for coconut oil? It works in stir fries, but the flavor isn't conducive to eggs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The coconut water is a pretty safe material. When the coconut is relatively fresh, the liquid should be almost clear and very sweet. It's surprisingly low in allergenicity. But the white material sold as milk is an industrially manufactured substance made by emulsifying some of the solids and oil with the liquid. The solids in coconut are very starchy and can be pretty allergenic.

I recommend using the highly filtered, deodorized form of coconut oil, which is extremely cheap. The aromatic, delicately scented ones that haven't been filtered can make some people very sick from an allergic reaction to the starches left in it. If it's very well filtered, high-quality oil, it tastes fine for frying chicken. I've been frying chicken in coconut oil for many years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There have been studies in the Philippines showing that people who used milk traditionally were having health problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, even in the traditional forms, it is probably not a very good food to use.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to answer your question, caller, Tropical Traditions Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil seems to be the best one I've found that doesn't have the coconut flavor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the very pleasant ways to use the deodorized oil is to emulsify it. A little bit of egg yolk is all it takes. If you warm the oil and the milk, just a touch of egg yolk will allow it to emulsify. You can make ice cream or cheesecake—all kinds of buttery, creamy consistency foods—using the emulsified coconut oil instead of cream or cream cheese.

## Rennet and Cheese Production

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to the GMO microbial enzymes and vegetarian rennet. Talk a little bit about why natural rennet from a calf's stomach is not being used now, but is being genetically modified on yeasts, and how this contributes to allergies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the trace allergens, parts of the fungus or the bacteria. Aspergillosis is a very serious disease, and people who work in some of these enzyme factories are exposed to dust from the microorganisms and develop allergies. But the regulators assume that the people who eat the stuff aren't going to have the same sort of reactions.

All of the organisms used in manufacturing amino acids, proteins, or enzymes have their risk of impurities being left in the product. Food producers are being pressured to give up the natural material and buy their stuff in a can, doing it like they were in a chemical lab rather than a kitchen.

For example, Nancy's used to be natural cottage cheese. The way cottage cheese was always made was to drain the curd and salt it. Draining it left the curd free of lactic acid. But a couple of years ago, someone convinced them to start using what they called a "dressing" consisting of lactic acid and dry milk powder to give the cottage cheese a very long shelf life. Lactic acid suppresses the growth of organisms, but it's also just as toxic to the people who eat it. It can very quickly stimulate the whole inflammatory chain reaction, the same as polyunsaturated fat. If that inflammation is continued chronically, it increases fibrosis and eventually increases the risk of cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And we're told lactic acid is good for us. To summarize: natural sources of rennet are animal rennet, fig juice, nettles, thistles, or lemon juice. Artificial sources are "vegetarian rennet" or microbial enzymes derived from mold or genetically engineered. So vegetarian rennet is not a safe rennet.

## Caller: Olive Oil and Canola Oil

**Caller:** What do you think of olive oil and canola oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In small quantities, like a teaspoonful or so of olive oil, it's fine and safe because it's only 10% of the toxic polyunsaturated fats.

Canola oil is very high in the polyunsaturates. It got its reputation as being healthful about 30 years ago when they learned to lower the erucic acid content. But Hans Selye demonstrated that it is not the erucic acid which was causing heart damage; it was the linoleic acid itself—the so-called essential fatty acid—which was causing death of heart cells. He showed that just by adding stearic acid from cocoa butter he could neutralize the toxic effect on the heart. So it's a ratio, and canola oil has a very high content of the dangerous polyunsaturates.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat can be reached on his website: www.raypeat.com. Thank you, Dr. Peat, for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** We probably only got halfway through the food ingredients. People should take more time to look at the ingredient panels on the foods they eat because you will find a lot of hidden material that causes problems. Thank you for listening.
