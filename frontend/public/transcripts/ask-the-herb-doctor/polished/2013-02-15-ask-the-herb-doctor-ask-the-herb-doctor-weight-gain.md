## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions. Tonight, we are very happy to have Dr. Raymond Peat share his expertise. We will be discussing weight gain, thyroid, progesterone, and other compounds essential for healthy metabolism and anti-stress, anti-aging effects. Thanks so much for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thanks.

**Andrew Murray:** For listeners who haven't heard of you, would you mind detailing your academic and professional career?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After I had taught linguistics and English for a while, I decided to go to graduate school in biology at the University of Oregon. I graduated there with my PhD in 1972, specializing in physiology and biochemistry, especially reproductive physiology. Right after I left university, I worked for a while with a diet company counseling people in weight loss.

## Weight Gain and Diet Adjustments

**Andrew Murray:** Hopefully we're going to cover a lot of material tonight regarding weight gain—how to avoid it and what causes it. There is an active Ray Peat Facebook fan page where people debate these topics. One issue people are discussing is how to adopt your diet without gaining weight. Specifically, people have mentioned gaining extra weight around the abdomen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is quite a broad statement. You can't just say "when people adopt Dr. Peat's diet," because if we say milk is good for you and you start drinking a half-gallon of whole milk a day without cutting out other calories, you are going to put on weight.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same applies to cheese. I advise eating cheese because of its high calcium and protein content, but you have to consider the calories. Some cheese has practically no fat, while others are basically like soft butter.

## Healthy Metabolism vs. Stress Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** One of the main components of weight management is a functional energy reserve coupled with a healthy metabolism. Could you outline what constitutes a healthy metabolism—specifically glucose oxidation—versus the fatty acid metabolism that occurs with stress?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you've told us before that if somebody has an unhealthy metabolism, they will have a hard time burning even 1,000 or 1,200 calories a day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There was a study about 30 or 40 years ago. Doctors used to follow the textbook standard that everyone can lose weight if they eat less than 1,700 calories a day, based on a study from the 1920s on healthy people. They put a group of women who claimed they were gaining weight on 1,000 calories into a closed ward. They found some could maintain their weight on 700 calories a day, especially women who had dieted a lot.

Several adaptations happen due to chronic, poorly balanced dieting. The thyroid slows down, and the muscle tissues atrophy from the stress. If you think of the stress metabolism as being very similar to the diabetic metabolism, basically you shift over to burning fat rather than sugar.

At rest, your brain and red blood cells need sugar and will keep burning it regardless of where they have to get it. If you don't eat enough of the necessary nutrients, your body will convert your muscles to sugar to keep feeding your brain. If you are eating enough sugar, your body doesn't have to break down its own tissues. In that condition, your muscles at rest require practically no glucose; they can do fine on a pure fat diet. However, if your muscles are under stress from intense exercise, they will begin burning almost pure sugar. So, it is the massive muscle at rest which will burn fat calories and leave the protein for your functioning tissues and the sugar for your brain.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this is why you're an advocate of muscle building? It helps your body burn fat for fuel rather than just using sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When the muscle is stressed, it begins actually producing estrogen. When you're building muscle in a safe way, the muscle begins producing testosterone right in the muscle, which helps the rest of the body. The heart is one of the main targets of testosterone. So, well-developed skeletal muscles are actually sustaining the heart muscle as well as the brain and lungs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this one reason why muscular people have longer lifespans?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Everything that tends to kill you shrinks your muscles. Frailty is the basic thing associated with aging.

## The Physiology of Starvation

**Andrew Murray:** So, a starvation-type diet forces your body into utilizing stored fats for energy, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Except when it does that, it also needs to make some sugar for your brain, so it breaks down tissues. The first to go is your thymus, which dissolves in just a few hours of intense stress. A long fast will completely devastate your thymus tissues. It turns into sugar very quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's important for your immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The skin is relatively dispensable too, so your skin atrophies very quickly with a fast or low-calorie diet. Then the muscles go. You can live months on your muscles providing sugar for your brain. Many of the women I saw for weight loss diets had muscles the size of a finger. When they started eating a good diet, the first thing that happened was pounds of water loss. Their tissue came out of the stress condition and shed stored water. Then, for about a month, they would start putting on weight as their muscles began growing.

**Andrew Murray:** Muscle is denser than fat, so a slender person with well-defined muscle would weigh more than a larger person who is large through fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. We would have people measure their waists, thighs, and hips, and each week they would get smaller even as they gained weight.

## Exercise: Runners vs. Bodybuilders

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about athletes and long-distance runners who are very thin and lean? How healthy is their metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a study using radioactive testosterone. They compared runners to weightlifters who had developed huge skeletal muscles. Using isotopes, they imaged the heart, lungs, and brain. The runners' tissues had atrophied; the lean long-distance runners had lean, flabby, very thin hearts.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's supposed to be the heart-healthy form of exercise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of things happen. Fertility is often reduced because testosterone goes down. Also, the lungs lose some ability to diffuse oxygen and carbon dioxide. The substance of the lung air sac thickens with just a moderate amount of continued exercise.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that an inflammatory process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a kind of edema or mild inflammation. Sports anemia is a recognized condition, somewhat like the feminizing effect of estrogen on the blood system.

## Metabolic Suppressors

**Andrew Murray:** Are some people more predisposed to inefficient glucose oxidation due to things like PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) or cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of things can interfere with a high rate of metabolism. Things that suppress your thyroid are the most common, but anything that increases cortisol or glucagon can interfere. Serotonin and estrogen, for example, both lower your body temperature. Many stresses increase those hormones, which tends to increase glucagon and shift you away from oxidizing glucose toward fatty acid oxidation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So sluggish digestion could increase estrogen and serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The bowel is one way to get rid of unneeded estrogen via the liver. If your bowel is sluggish, you reabsorb it. If your bowel is irritated, it secretes much more serotonin than needed, which brings up stress hormones and lowers temperature.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So eating carrots with vinegar, or taking liver herbs like cascara and dandelion root, can help with sluggish bowels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And just eating what you consider to be the most delicious food can greatly help the intestine secrete more juices so things digest faster.

## Safe Muscle Building for Seniors

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned that exercise and muscle building is important when adopting this diet. How do you advocate that for a sedentary 60-year-old lady?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just doing an occasional knee bend—squatting and standing up again—and maybe getting some five-pound dumbbells. Lift those in different motions just a few times, two or three times a day.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's about being actively involved in generating muscle, however gently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Make the muscle know that it's been active, warm it up a little, but not enough to make you get out of breath.

## Foamy Urine and Stress Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** You’ve mentioned foaming urine as an indicator of excess excretion of steroid hormone precursors and a sign of stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the morning, you have generally been exposed to several hours of darkness. Darkness is very stressful. Everyone is at their peak of exposure to stress hormones in the morning. During stress, like starvation or the overnight fast, hormones mobilize energy production, involving increased free fatty acids.

If your liver is well-nourished and supplied with thyroid, it will process steroids such as estrogen and cortisol. The liver attaches either sulfate or sugar (glucuronic acid) to make them water-soluble so they can be excreted by the kidneys. When attached to the sulfate or sugar, it acts like a soap—oily at one end and water-soluble at the other—so it makes foam.

**Andrew Murray:** If a person consumes adequate sugars during the day to stock their liver, or has ice cream or orange juice before bed to keep adrenaline down, is it still possible to have foaming morning urine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the stress always occurs. But if you are sleeping soundly, there is less intense damage. If you stayed awake in the dark, you would probably have super foamy urine.

## PUFA Accumulation

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the shift in fat content—switching to butter, coconut oil, and excluding liquid oils (PUFA)—you've said it's difficult to avoid PUFA totally.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Natural foods like milk, beef, lamb, and coconut oil all have 2% or 3% polyunsaturated fats. If you eat just a tiny bit more than you burn, some gets stored. The body recognizes that saturated fat is good to burn right away, so it selectively stores the polyunsaturated fat. Over time, your fat tissue becomes more polyunsaturated. So as you get older, your fat stores become more anti-thyroid and pro-estrogenic.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I often recommend 3 tablespoons of coconut oil a day. But if someone only burns 700 calories a day, would you still recommend that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, more like a small teaspoon three times a day.

## Measuring Metabolic Rate

**Andrew Murray:** Is there a way for people to assess their metabolic rate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One way is to calculate the fluid you drink—milk, juice, coffee—and measure the total volume of urine output. The difference is what evaporated. In an average level of activity and humidity, a person will generally evaporate a liter per thousand calories burned. If you only have a missing liter of fluid in the day, you know you're only burning a thousand calories.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if someone drinks a half-gallon (approx. 2 liters) and pees out a quart and a half, that’s a bad ratio.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A pint evaporated out of two liters suggests a 1,500 calorie burn, which isn't very much either.

## Caller: Exercise and Light Therapy

**Caller (David from Missouri):** I have a weak left knee and I've been experimenting with a rebounder versus running in place. What do you think?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know if there's much benefit to the bouncing. It does strengthen bones through compression, but something that builds more massive muscles—like resistance training in little bursts—would help to raise your androgens and strengthen the connective tissues.

**Caller (David):** What about basic yoga, holding postures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That kind of stress is good for the muscles.

**Caller (David):** I use the 250-watt bulbs you recommended. Is it useful to use those right before bed and when arising in the morning?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Studies on plant tissues showed that any tissue put in sunlight or UV light got some excited free radicals. Shining red light on those would immediately quench the excited electrons. If you keep living tissue in the dark, it starts building up those excited electrons.

**Caller (David):** Is dreaming a sign of stress during the night?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The metabolism has 90-minute cycles. If your liver is running short on fuel, the cycles become more intense. Dream cycles go with drops in blood sugar and surges of nerve chemicals like adrenaline. If your body is well rested, dreams are likely to be pleasant. Nightmares usually mean your body is stressed and not getting what it needs.

## Caller: Urine Output Clarification

**Caller (Piercy):** If you take in a half-gallon of fluid a day and pee out most of that, is that healthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It shows that you're not evaporating very much. If you are indoors with average humidity, it means your metabolism is slow and not producing much heat. Healthy people, like 12 to 15-year-olds, burn fuel very wastefully. That is when people are least likely to die—when they are wasting fuel like crazy.

**Caller (Piercy):** So a fast metabolism is a healthier metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the wasteful energy metabolism.

## Caller: Antidepressants and Weight Gain

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** One side effect of anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs is weight gain. Do you know how this works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they increase your exposure to serotonin or decrease your adrenaline, they'll slow your metabolic rate and make it harder to burn calories.

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** I'm reading that there are no conclusive studies relating low serotonin with mental state.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They aren't even sure how SSRIs work anyway.

## Calorie Quality: Orange Juice vs. Starch

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding the ideal diet, Sarah deals with many people on this.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If Dr. Peat recommended a quart of orange juice and a quart of milk a day, you wouldn't have room for much else if you only burn 700 calories.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you use 1% milk, that's only 400 calories per quart. Orange juice has chemicals that are anti-estrogenic, and milk calcium is very important as an anti-inflammatory and anti-stress agent. People who eat the same number of calories without milk are much more likely to be fat.

In Russia, I found there was no reliably good milk and the people had bad teeth and were fat. Crossing the border into Finland, stores had displays of cheese and the people were healthy-looking and slender.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So 400 calories from orange juice is not comparative to 400 calories from baked potatoes and rice. The rice would increase stress hormones and suppress metabolism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. Also, starch particles can enter the bloodstream and trigger stress hormones.

## Caller: Weight Loss During Sleep

**Caller:** I lose about 5 pounds of weight sleeping some nights. Is it better to be cold or warm at night to lose weight?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on how you respond to the cold. Some people steam up the windows, meaning they lose weight by evaporation. But if your body temperature drops because you are slowing down to resist stress, you turn on inflammatory hormones. If your feet reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit (cold), they are producing toxic stress substances.

**Caller:** So it's better to be comfortable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Don't have a cold head or cold feet. Some people sleep better taking a warm foot bath and wearing wool socks and a cap.

## Caller: Food Choices

**Caller (Phillipsville):** You mentioned eating food that tastes delicious. Is it good to eat whole grains like brown rice and millet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, there's almost nothing of value in those. White rice is relatively free of toxins, but has very little food value.

**Caller (Phillipsville):** What about ice cream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has a good balance because it has fat, protein, and sugar. It can help a lot of people go to sleep.

**Caller (Phillipsville):** What about fruit juices other than orange juice? Like berry, peach, or carrot juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many juices are good for minerals and antioxidants. Grape juice is very good. Some tropical fruits like guava and mango are good. Carrot juice should be avoided except in small amounts because the high carotene content antagonizes both thyroid and progesterone.
