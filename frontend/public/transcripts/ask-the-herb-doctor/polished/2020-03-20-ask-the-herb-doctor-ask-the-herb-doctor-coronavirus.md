## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to the March 20, 2020 edition of *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. You are invited to call in with questions related to this month's very specific topic: the worldwide frenzy surrounding the coronavirus. Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us, and he is bringing a very interesting mental shift to how we are looking at this.

I want to state at the very outset that this is a very emotional subject. No one is taking death lightly; when you have loved ones dying, it is absolutely no joke. While some comments may seem light regarding statistical numbers—referencing presentations from Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg in Germany—I will provide information for people to search this on the internet and see for themselves how some of these statistics have been skewed. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for joining us. As usual, please introduce yourself so listeners can find out a little more about your background.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got a Master of Arts degree in 1960 from the University of Oregon, then a PhD in 1972 specializing in physiology and biochemistry. I have been concentrating on reproductive and aging biology, with special attention to the nervous system and how nutrition interacts with those changes. It turns out I never was interested in virology, but this particular virus impinges exactly on the things I've been working on for a long time: inflammation, aging, and cellular respiration.

## Understanding Influenza and Comorbidities

**Andrew Murray:** I would like to outline influenza for people because the terms can be confusing. There are four types: A, B, C, and D. Only type A really produces the major flus—the Spanish flu, Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, Bird flu, SARS, and MERS.

When most people get a common cold, it is often a coronavirus. The main issue with influenza is the massive amount of inflammation that comes as the body's immune response to the virus. A severe complication is viral pneumonia, which can be secondarily infected by bacteria. This can overwhelm a system that is already crashing because of inflammation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a person gets a verified influenza virus, a typical analysis will find various other viruses, like common cold viruses and other respiratory pathogens, as well as the true influenza virus. So, even when there is a confirmed flu virus, you can't be sure that is really the culprit.

At present, most of the people getting seriously sick or dying are old—definitely beyond their mid-50s, with the highest mortality over 70. One report stated that 99% of the people dying with the coronavirus were suffering from other very serious conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or stroke symptoms. These things made it much more likely that they would die from stress. Other pathogens take advantage of that weak condition. Just because you have a test for one particular pathogen, you can't be sure that it is the contributing factor when there are so many other pathogens present.

## Origins and Phylogenetics of the Virus

**Andrew Murray:** Let's get into the origin of this. Most people are accepting the standard doctrine that this is of Chinese origin, coming from a wet market via a zoonotic infection. However, you mentioned some interesting facts regarding the gene sequencing indicating a different origin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Virologists in Europe, the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, and China have referred to DNA sequence analysis showing that the "trunk" of the family tree is in the United States. There are five different branches or varieties occurring early in the United States before the strain appeared in China. The strain in China identifies as the fourth or fifth branch off this trunk.

This is based on analyzing substitutions of bases in the DNA chain. If you have a virus with two changes, and then a third one with three changes, the ones with fewer changes necessarily came before the last one. The family tree of this virus shows that the one occurring in November in Wuhan was the fourth or fifth descendant.

**Andrew Murray:** So, people have been pointing out a 2015 article in *Nature* regarding this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It was a news item mentioning that people connected to the CDC, working at Fort Detrick, Maryland, were creating pathogens to develop a vaccine in advance. Normally, it takes 12 to 18 months to prepare a vaccine for a new strain, and by that time the flu season has passed. They wanted to have a vaccine ready before a natural epidemic broke out.

The CDC patented a coronavirus in 2003 specifically to work on that project. However, last summer—around July or August—it was in the news that the CDC ordered the closure of the virus lab at Fort Detrick because they had carelessly let their escape protection system deteriorate. They closed the lab because of the danger of an escaped virus just two months before the outbreak.

Additionally, American soldiers participated in international military athletic contests in Wuhan. Normally, these army athletes are outstanding, Olympic quality. But last year, for unknown reasons, the US team came in 35th rank among all countries. The Chinese were commenting on how poorly they performed, which was unusual.

**Andrew Murray:** That is interesting. However, I know there has been a very recent article published by top-ranked virologists regarding the engineering of this virus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they say that this particular virus was impossible to anticipate. Even though the intent of the CDC for years was to make a pathogen to study, these recent virologists say that the nature of this particular one is such that they can't foresee anyone having engineered it.

## Statistics, Testing, and Mortality Rates

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about the numbers. This event has paralyzed the world economically. We have Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, who flat-out refuses to believe this is anything exceptional compared to standard flu seasons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** John Ioannidis, another well-known professor who analyzes statistical disease situations, is suggesting that this might be history's greatest "evidence fiasco."

Dr. Wodarg and Ioannidis point out that we can't see the evidence clearly because we weren't doing this type of testing in previous years to compare. In China, it first looked like 2.7% of those infected were dying. But as they produced huge amounts of test kits and tested large numbers of people, the mortality rate per infection decreased to 0.6%. Ioannidis suggests the actual mortality figure could range from 0.025% up to 5%, depending on the population.

If you only look at people reporting to hospitals, a 10% mortality rate isn't unreasonable because you are measuring the sickest people. But as the testing population expands, the mortality rate drops, approaching the normal flu mortality of one in a thousand.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, give us an idea about how statistics can be skewed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I compare it to what happened historically with cancer incidence. Years ago, General Electric advertised that if everyone bought their X-ray machines, we could increase the cancer cure rate to 97%. If you diagnose cancer in 100% of the population, but only a small percentage were ever going to die from it, you can claim a high cure rate by treating people who never would have developed symptoms.

However, when you treat cancer aggressively, the mortality rate can increase with the diagnostic rate due to the treatment itself. Similarly, when you use a diagnostic test to herd people into hospitals, you subject them to a high rate of medical accidents. Historically in the US, between 200,000 and 440,000 people are killed by medical mistakes in hospitals annually.

## The Spanish Flu and Antivirals

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller asking about the origins of the Spanish Flu and theories surrounding that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The data is based on very few actual tissue samples compared to the millions of deaths. At that time, the flu was thought to be a bacterial infection. A popular treatment was injecting camphor dissolved in oil.

It turns out that a distillate of petroleum smelled like camphor. About 50 years ago, they purified it and added an amino group to make it water-soluble, creating the drug Amantadine, and its relatives Rimantadine and Memantine. These are broad-spectrum antivirals. They happen to be safe genetically.

In contrast, many antivirals being recommended recently—such as Acyclovir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine—interfere with human DNA and are recognized as genotoxic. If you have millions of people taking those preventively, you are going to have millions of people with genetic damage. You don't want that in a young population.

**Andrew Murray:** So you consider Memantine safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they are safe genetically and moderately effective against a wide variety of viruses. But aspirin, if it were under patent, would be considered a "super antiviral" because it is active against a wide variety, including influenza, herpes, rhinovirus, and hepatitis.

## Masks and Hygiene

**Caller:** Since transmission is by droplets from the oral or nasal cavity, wouldn't mandatory wearing of masks stop the spread?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That does seem reasonable since the aerosol will likely be trapped on a fairly fine, porous mask.

**Andrew Murray:** And regular hand washing is the number one preventative.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Soap is a surefire parasiticide for this type of virus. It is very virucidal on the skin.

## Social Distancing and Herd Immunity

**Caller:** The Governor of California said around half the population is going to get infected. Do you think that is an accurate projection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is within the historical range, but almost none of them will have a serious sickness. The reason there is a flu season from winter until late spring is that in temperate zones, sun exposure goes down. Most people become Vitamin D deficient and extremely susceptible to infection. By summer, Vitamin D rises, and viral immunity rises strongly, ending the flu season.

## Vitamin D, ACE2, and Treatments

**Andrew Murray:** I have a friend using 20,000 IU of Vitamin D per day, and their blood levels are just in the middle of the reference range.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The best way to know if you are taking enough is with a blood test. Dr. Peat, you recommend not being below 50 ng/mL?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, 50 to 60 ng/mL is a safe range. Probably 95% of people I've seen are below that. Low Vitamin D is connected to fatigue, muscle weakness, and high blood pressure.

Vitamin D and adequate calcium work on the same part of the immune system as the drugs the Chinese have been having success with: Cinanserin (a serotonin blocker) and Losartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would you recommend people ask for a prescription of Losartan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A man in Italy emailed me about his friend with confirmed coronavirus. I mentioned the Chinese recommendations. He got a Losartan prescription, and the next day his friend was out of bed. Today he emailed saying his friend feels like he has "new lungs."

**Andrew Murray:** Can you outline the mechanism regarding ACE1 and ACE2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is confusion because some say that since the virus attacks the ACE2 enzyme, anything that increases ACE2 must increase susceptibility. But it is exactly the opposite.

ACE2 is a defensive, anti-inflammatory enzyme that destroys angiotensin. It trims two amino acids off the angiotensin molecule, turning it into Angiotensin 1-7, which prevents fibrotic and inflammatory processes in the lungs and heart. Things that block the AT1 receptor (like Losartan) also increase the ACE2 enzyme, which is protective.

## Herbal Strategies

**Andrew Murray:** From an herbal perspective, for the primary pneumonia or "cytokine storm," you want anti-inflammatories. Echinacea root is definitely an anti-inflammatory. Elderberry has also been highlighted. For secondary bacterial infections, volatile oil herbs like Thyme and the mint family are positively antibacterial. But the main goal is to control the inflammation.

## Economic Impact

**Caller:** What will it take for our economy to bounce back?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government is talking about giving money to corporations. Milton Friedman, the conservative economist, proposed a minimum basic income decades ago. I think he was on the right track; it is necessary to get money to the consumers, not just to the corporations that are losing money.

## Mortality Context and Conclusion

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned an average of 44,000 flu deaths annually in the US. If 10% of those were caused by coronavirus strains in previous years, we would expect a certain baseline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, Dr. Wodarg made the point that based on the historical curve, the current deaths are actually behind the expected mortality curve in places like Germany.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In 2017, there were 85,000 pneumonia deaths in the US, and 58,000 of those were people over 70.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Old age causes sepsis and pneumonia as common causes of death. Old age changes the inflammatory system the same way this virus does—increasing the angiotensin receptor and decreasing the protective ACE2 system. Anything you do to protect against viral effects is really protecting against aging.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, Vitamin D, Vitamin B1, and aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, those move the system in the corrective direction.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to hold it there. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Peat. You can be found at www.raypeat.com.
