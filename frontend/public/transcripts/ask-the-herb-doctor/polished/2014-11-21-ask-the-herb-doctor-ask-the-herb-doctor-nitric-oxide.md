## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who have perhaps never listened to the show, which runs every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, I'm a licensed medical herbalist. My wife and I run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

Dr. Raymond Peat is happily joining us on the show to share his latest discoveries and research. You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of nitric oxide. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. For those who have never heard you, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, I studied for a master's degree at the University of Oregon in literature and related things, and then studied linguistics for a while. Finally, I came back to study biology from 1968 to 1972, specializing in the physiology of reproduction and aging, and especially the biochemical side of aging physiology.

## The Dangers of Nitric Oxide and Viagra

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask you some questions about your most recent newsletter based on nitric oxide. Given that the compound manufactured by Pfizer—Viagra—is well known, and nitric oxide has a major vasodilatory effect, what is it about nitric oxide that makes it so dangerous? It is responsible for things like cardiac arrest, stroke, arrhythmias, and increased ocular pressure. I've had several people who have used Viagra and had a heart attack or stroke. Also, recreational drug users use "poppers," which is exactly the same compound. What is your take on nitric oxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Speaking of poppers, several of the early theorists of AIDS were blaming it on the chemical—nitric oxide or a nitric compound—produced from the poppers. They were arguing that that in itself was enough to account for AIDS among the people who were using that as a pleasure drug.

In the 1980s, everyone knew nitric oxide primarily as a toxic component of smog. When people started discovering that it was being produced in small amounts in the body, they immediately started looking for parallels with smog poisoning: lung injury, circulatory disease, and so on. One of the first things they found was that it kills the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. So, in the early 1940s, there was a flurry of papers demonstrating that our "internal smog" is just as toxic as Los Angeles smog.

But then the Viagra patent and publicity came out in the later 1990s. Suddenly, the medical publications all found that it was a glorious, natural protector of just about every function you can think of—making you smarter, giving you more endurance, and all kinds of good things. After a few years, the investment in publicity started wearing off and people started coming back to the diabetes-producing effects and looking at what it's actually doing biochemically.

**Andrew Murray:** How does it cause harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The basic way it causes harm is probably parallel to the effects of carbon monoxide or cyanide: it is a competitor for oxygen. In the mitochondria—the enzymes that produce most of our energy—it knocks out not only the key final respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, but it poisons the previous electron-transporting parts of the mitochondrion too. Simply turning off the energy supply can account for a lot of its problems.

When you stop the oxidative run through the mitochondrion, the mitochondrion starts leaking electrons that have no place to go. The whole cell shifts over to a reduced chemical state. If you imagine a stream of electrons falling steadily towards oxygen, when you cut that off, they accumulate and float back. This reducing environment shifts the balance of sulfur compounds, and the surface properties of the cell change.

This cloud of excess electrons flows through an enzyme called NADPH oxidase and directly reduces oxygen on the surface. That produces superoxide, a possibly toxic free radical, which then produces hydrogen peroxide. In immune cells under stress, that's considered productive because it helps break down bacteria. However, this hydrogen peroxide can be used to oxidize chloride—which is always present—into hypochlorite. Basically, it becomes like Clorox.

**Andrew Murray:** So in general, nitric oxide forms a pretty energy-wasteful mechanism and is also damaging in its free radical producing effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, this shift of the whole cell away from oxidation starts a process that people are still just starting to put together. It has effects on the nervous system; for example, Parkinson's disease has signs that nitric oxide is one of the central damaging components of the dopamine system.

## Blocking Nitric Oxide: Progesterone and Methylene Blue

**Andrew Murray:** There are three species of nitric oxide. The one most commonly referenced is the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). That has been implicated in causing increased severity of disease, including herpes simplex encephalitis and chronic viral hepatitis. What are the most reasonable ways of blocking nitric oxide synthesis in the body, or at least managing its production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has various natural ways of keeping it under control. For example, progesterone inhibits the enzyme that makes nitric oxide, while estrogen excites and activates that enzyme. When the cell is stabilized by a generous amount of progesterone and related neurosteroids—including pregnenolone—those hold down the production.

Anything that irritates the cell and excites it, like endotoxin from the intestine, is probably the biggest single constant promoter of nitric oxide production. Sometimes serotonin and histamine, which are produced in reaction to endotoxin, can increase the formation of nitric oxide. Caffeine and similar drugs are known to have protective anti-toxic effects by turning down nitric oxide production locally.

In recent years, an old dye called methylene blue—which was used as a treatment for malaria 100 years ago—is being used for a tremendous variety of therapeutic purposes. Simply by turning down nitric oxide, methylene blue is having very positive effects in a variety of things, including herpes and other chronic viral diseases.

**Andrew Murray:** What would be a good short-term approach to block that from what is available presently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Niacinamide and progesterone are commonly available. But methylene blue, when available, is probably a good emergency thing to turn off the massive amounts of overproduced nitric oxide.

**Andrew Murray:** I read an article referencing methylene blue having favorable suppressive activity in small amounts, but larger amounts could actually cause harm.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the toxicity experiments have been ridiculous, feeding rats the equivalent of an ounce or two of crystalline methylene blue. That amount of any concentrated chemical is going to be harmful.

However, 25 years ago, a well-controlled study of severely depressed people showed that 15 milligrams per day was all it took to relieve severe depression. The side effects of even many times higher doses are essentially zero. Two studies gave graded doses up to the equivalent of 4 to 6 grams a day for a person—many times higher than the curative anti-depressive dose—for the whole lifespan of rats and mice. They saw no life-shortening effects. In fact, in female mice, they saw an extension of the maximum lifespan with the highest dose.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think the effects of methylene blue are due to electron quenching or electrical stabilizing activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the known mechanisms is that it can receive electrons from the mediator that receives them from glucose—NADH, for example—and then pass those electrons onto the part of the mitochondrion that is still working, bypassing damaged parts. So it can act like a missing enzyme, restoring mitochondrial function.

Also, the receptor that causes excitotoxic damage from overdoses of glutamic acid involves two sulfur groups. Methylene blue oxidizes those and turns off the receptor, stopping the excitotoxic process. That excitotoxic process is one of the things that turns on nitric oxide production.

**Andrew Murray:** Methylene blue is not a controlled substance; it's just a dye, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, fish farmers use it to cure various fish infections.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned there were other ways it blocks nitric oxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've counted about six different ways. The excitotoxic thing was one. Preventing excess polymerization of the microtubules is another. Probably increasing progesterone production and inhibiting estrogen production are others. But probably the most important thing people should do is be critical about the tremendous amount of propaganda selling the idea that people should eat more arginine to increase their nitric oxide production.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow. It always amazes me how this stuff comes into circulation as "common knowledge."

## Caller: Environmental Estrogens

**Caller:** I'm from Southern Humboldt. I wanted to know if all of the estrogen imitators in the environment are also something that will put us at risk?

**Andrew Murray:** Very much so.

**Caller:** I think I've seen that Bisphenol A (BPA) activates nitric oxide production.

**Andrew Murray:** There you go. And that's an estrogen promoter mimic. Dr. Peat, what do you think are some of the most damaging environmental estrogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The natural estrogen is damaging enough. It's getting into the rivers through the sewage. I think natural estrogen and birth control estrogens—which are many times stronger—are getting into all the downstream waterways that receive sewage.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** As a sewer board person, I can tell you that one of the ways they tell whether water is coming from a sewage system or from nature is they look for caffeine. That's considered a marker for sewage. So yes, a lot of those chemicals do make it through.

**Caller:** Is there a plant or an herb that mimics methylene blue that you can ingest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've looked around at various molecules. Methylene blue was a precursor for many drugs like tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines. It's a three-ring molecule, structurally roughly the same size and shape as steroid hormones.

I've looked at plants that make analogous things. The tetracyclines have many of the same anti-inflammatory effects; I suspect they work against nitric oxide. Vitamin K and Vitamin E are analogous in some ways. Lapacho, a chemical from a South American tree (*Tabebuia impetiginosa* or Pau d'Arco), is a dye that has many of the anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer properties of methylene blue.

Recently, people are talking about an Asian herb, black cumin, which contains thymoquinone. The quinones seem to be the essential model of the protective, pro-oxidant stabilizing chemical. Thymoquinone is considered a very powerful anti-inflammatory, and I suspect it will turn out to be acting against excess nitric oxide.

## Caller: Thyroid Signs and Carrots

**Caller:** I'm from Arcata. It was mentioned some time ago about a nutrient that could help remediate the earlobe crease. Does that ring a bell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is mainly a thyroid deficiency.

**Caller:** Was there a simple recommendation for correction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the main thing causing hypothyroidism in so many people is an excess of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), because they are able to block the production of thyroid hormone, its transport, and its action.

**Andrew Murray:** So avoid nuts and seeds that contain liquid oils. Dr. Peat always recommends coconut oil and butter as the two saturated sources of fat. Avoid liquid polyunsaturates, fish oil being the worst.

**Caller:** What about cod liver oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't have any better source, cod liver oil is a great source of Vitamin D, but it's better to get sunlight.

**Caller:** One other question. There was something about eating carrots—an antiseptic aspect. It was recommended that carrots be cut diagonally. As a juicer, I thought that was peculiar.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat has always mentioned grated carrots to increase the surface area. It acts as an antiseptic for the gut, removing excess estrogen and other waste products.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The juice contains a lot of good things, but if you throw away the fiber, you're losing the most important thing for stimulating and cleaning the intestine.

## Caller: Arginine and Viagra

**Caller:** I've got a couple of questions. First, did you say that L-arginine was bad? I've heard that was supposed to be good for you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The internet is swamped with advertisements for ways to supplement arginine. L-arginine is the natural amino acid, but if you get more than you need, it will increase your tendency to overproduce nitric oxide. Too much tryptophan also boosts that. It's very important to keep your amino acids in good balance, especially avoiding too much cysteine, tryptophan, methionine, and arginine.

**Caller:** So you don't recommend taking an L-arginine supplement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think it's very dangerous.

**Caller:** Now, did you say that Viagra is bad for you because it's made out of this nitric oxide stuff?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It inhibits an enzyme that is supposed to inactivate a substance made by the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide starts a chain reaction, and Viagra keeps that chain reaction going. In the process, it ends up systemically increasing the effect and level of nitric oxide. So it probably is increasing the aging process in the brain, heart, and pancreas.

**Caller:** But they say having sex is good for you. If that improves sexual function in an older man, isn't there a balance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it would be better to work on the actual physiological problem. Improving natural circulation and restoring good thyroid function will often increase libido and potency.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I remember you mentioning pregnenolone or progesterone as being very positive. You said it does not block the vasodilatory ability, so it actually promotes erection and is a reasonably safe way of doing that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aging men have decreased amounts of testosterone and progesterone and increasing amounts of estrogen. That shift increases the tendency to have erectile problems. One of the odd side effects of increased nitric oxide is that it decreases the ability to make testosterone. I think in both men and women, nitric oxide opposes and lowers those protective steroids while increasing estrogen.

## Nitric Oxide and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** What are your thoughts on the cancer-promoting effects of nitric oxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's one of the central factors in keeping cancer going. It is a definite promoter of cancer growth and metastasis. Many publications are now recognizing that breast cancer, prostate cancer, and probably every cancer will eventually be discovered to respond badly to nitric oxide.

The Warburg hypothesis was that cancer shifts away from oxygen as the energy source to producing lactic acid. Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are both able to knock out mitochondrial function and imitate cancer metabolism. Several recent publications show that the Warburg cancer metabolism is created by nitric oxide excess and is turned off by methylene blue.

## Immunity and "The Strong Man"

**Andrew Murray:** I have a question about immunity. Why are some individuals immune to HIV or able to mount a successful response against hepatitis? Why do some have an innate immunity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are new ideas about the immune system from Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger. I see the body as an ecosystem which is simply so strong in some people at maintaining its own organization that when an invader like a bacterium, virus, or cancer cell enters, the situation is so tightly organized in favor of the host that the invader can't find a place. The niches are all occupied doing business with the owner of the property. I don't see it as killing the invader, but simply using up all the electron space productively so keeping the door shut prevents strange things, like turning sugar into lactic acid.

## Questions: MSM, DCA, and Antioxidants

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Two simple questions coming through. First one is MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane)—does it have an influence on libido?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I am very cautious about it. Dimethyl sulfide has its uses, but I'm not sure that there's anything really fully safe with MSM.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about DCA (Dichloroacetate) for cancers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens to be very similar to methylene blue in the way it is essentially non-toxic in moderate amounts. People are getting as much as 10 or 12 grams per day intravenously and feeling great. What it does is restore the productive oxidation of glucose, getting electrons to go all the way to form carbon dioxide. It reverses the cancer metabolism—the Warburg metabolism—the same way methylene blue does. I see it as a very important way of making up for the toxic effects of nitric oxide, endotoxin, and free radical fat oxidation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You've spoken of antioxidants that are too strong. Could you give a spectrum? Is ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid) too strong?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) in the right proportion and situation are very safe and constructive. Alpha lipoic acid is pretty safe. But I would be very cautious with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). I think large amounts of it can push the balance in the wrong direction.

## Thyroid Intolerance and Magnesium

**Andrew Murray:** I had a question from a woman with hypothyroidism symptoms (depression, weight gain, cold hands/feet). Her TSH was 1.6 and T3 was 3.5. She used to take Armour Thyroid, but when she tried to supplement with T3 or a T3/T4 combination recently, she developed anxiety and tachycardia—even at small doses like 1mg of T3. What causes a person to become sensitive to thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes the product has changed; European forms of thyroid supplements seem unpredictable. But if it is the same product, usually a magnesium deficiency can cause exactly those symptoms. Thyroid makes your cells able to use magnesium. A big organ like your skeletal muscles and bones can take up so much from your blood that your brain and heart have trouble getting the magnesium they need to respond to the thyroid. Then you get an exaggerated stress and adrenaline reaction.

Also, low cholesterol is another limiting factor. If you have very low cholesterol, you can't respond to increasing your thyroid because one of the basic functions of thyroid is to turn cholesterol into progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA.

**Andrew Murray:** What dose of magnesium would be suitable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 100 milligrams at a time. If you take one or two micrograms of Cytomel (T3), 100 milligrams of magnesium will be plenty for the first two or three hours of responding to that thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** What is a good magnesium source?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruit juices and coffee. If you want a really intense source, you can boil leaves like kale or beet greens for just two or three minutes. The green water that comes out is very concentrated in magnesium and calcium.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** I'd love to look into the research about the "third circulatory system" and how we are what we eat next month.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a German group has been looking at DNA from our foods getting incorporated into our own DNA. Some biologists have been theorizing about this for a hundred years. When you ingest pollen blowing in the air, some of that DNA is probably getting incorporated into our chromosomes.
