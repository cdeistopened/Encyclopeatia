## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

This month, we wanted to continue exploring the positive role that sugar has to play in the diet and why good sugars are essential for good health. It seems that many things we're told are bad for us are actually beneficial, and we need to see the facts and the research that's out there. With an ever-increasing worldwide prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, what is it about sugar that we can defend?

We're excited to have Dr. Ray Peat with us again this month, and we'll be hearing from him on scientific research-based facts. Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us again. Would you please introduce yourself and your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been writing a newsletter on health issues for about 30 years. I started that about eight years after finishing my PhD research at the University of Oregon. Part of the reason for starting my own newsletter was seeing that the science journals are very doctrinaire and influenced by industry. Since doing my study at the University of Oregon, I've been reading lots and experimenting some on my own.

**Andrew Murray:** I know that you've published many articles and your specialisms are hormones—pregnenolone, estrogen, protective hormones—things that we normally would confer some protection to people from aging and free radical damage. Your other specialties are thyroid and polyunsaturated fats.

The sugar issue—you joined us last month, and we got some of the way through expanding on why sugars are good for you. As you mentioned, the common indoctrination is that sugars are bad for you, just like salt and saturated fats are supposedly bad for you. For those listening who may be diagnosed as diabetic, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid, sugar has had bad press in the last 20 years or so. They would have us eat less sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, that actually started about 200 years ago.

## The History of Sugar and Diabetes

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So what's the history behind why we started being told that sugar was bad for us 200 years ago?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At that time, they had defined diabetes as the "sugar disease" because they discovered glucose in urine. The mechanically thinking doctors said if you don't put glucose in, it can't come out. But in fact, the glucose was being produced by dissolving the protein in the person's body. It turned out that the worst thing you can do is to starve them for sugar because that accelerates the breakdown of both protein and fat.

Two doctors, at least in the 19th century, went against that conventional opinion and started giving their patients the amount of sugar extra in their diet that they were losing in the urine, figuring that they would die more slowly from diabetes. They found that they actually recovered very quickly. That curative effect of large amounts of sugar has been fairly recently demonstrated in animal experiments and in vitro experiments in which sugar stimulates the regeneration of pancreatic insulin-producing cells.

## Physiology: Cortisol and Fasting

**Andrew Murray:** So a basic question then: Do humans need sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Monkeys, for example, who normally live on fruit, develop very high cortisol levels when fruit is scarce. That is something that happens in any animal that habitually has a mixed diet containing carbohydrate. Some animals, like reptiles, can get along nicely on a protein diet. We can turn protein into sugar and fat, but it happens that one of the effects of the sugar is to inhibit the cortisol which turns protein into sugar. So, sugar spares protein; we don't have to eat so much of it.

Cortisol has many side effects other than breaking down the tissue proteins. At the same time that it helps to digest protein foods, it changes the whole arrangement of the way metabolism works. So it's better if we can minimize cortisol. Sugars also inhibit the chronic release of free fatty acids from storage. Our body—our brain in particular, and some tissues such as the red blood cells—strongly prefer sugars over fats and function better. When we get enough sugar, we inhibit the release of fats from storage and allow these tissues to have all the sugar they need.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's basically a backup mechanism. When you don't eat sugar, your body will get the sugar from your protein, your muscles, your bones, and your brain. The cortisol dissolves various organs that will then release different free fatty acids or proteins that the body will convert into sugar. That's a less preferable backup mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The famous arctic explorer, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, reported that people he knew eating a mostly fat and meat diet seemed to be many years older by appearance than they really were.

When people try to lose weight by fasting, what happens is for a day or so, their cortisol is still high and their metabolic rate is fairly high. So, they are living on a meat diet as they dissolve their muscles and fat. The thymus gland is one of the first to be dissolved. Since we would eat ourselves up in just two or three weeks if we kept eating at the same rate, our metabolic rate slows down drastically under the influence of these free amino acids liberated from our tissues. Those turn the thyroid hormone off. The falling blood sugar and the rising free amino acids and free fatty acids all turn our metabolic rate down. Then we can get along on a very low-calorie intake, but it slows down reproductive function, brain function, everything.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So basically, fasting is the worst thing you can do if you're trying to lose weight.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, or pretty much anything. Fasting turns off the liver's ability to detoxify things, so you're exposing yourself to increased toxins rather than decreased. The only thing that benefits is the intestine from not putting bad stuff into it.

## Types of Sugar: Fructose vs. Glucose

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of sugar as a quantity to consume, I've heard you say 170 to 250 grams of sugar per day. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think for a person of normal activity and eating mixed foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Let's discuss some of these sugars. Which ones are good sugars and which ones are bad sugars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lactose has a lot of special properties, so it's a very good sugar. It's somewhat slowly absorbed, but it stimulates digestion. It helps with calcium metabolism and absorbing the other nutrients in milk.

Sucrose consists of one unit of glucose and one of fructose. That is fairly quickly broken into the components when we eat it. The glucose stimulates insulin. Fructose, besides not itself stimulating insulin, actually slightly inhibits the release of insulin. So if you ate pure glucose, you would get a stronger insulin reaction. In most situations, if you eat slightly faster than you're metabolizing, a surge of excess glucose is going to turn on your fat metabolism. When you take sucrose with the fructose component, it will moderate the secretion of insulin and the production of fat depots.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because if a sugar stimulates insulin production, your liver is not happy and you store that sugar as fat. So we want to be eating the types of sugars that don't strongly stimulate insulin so we can use the sugar in our liver and stimulate metabolism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Surprisingly, fructose—besides moderating the production of fat—does many other things. It raises your temperature by a variety of mechanisms, which all by itself will increase your metabolic rate. It increases your conversion of carbohydrate to energy by about 20%. It'll do that even in a fairly small amount.

With sucrose, you have a 50/50 ratio, and it activates several components of the thyroid system better than glucose. Glucose is essential for keeping the thyroid functioning optimally, but fructose does some extra things that cause it to raise your temperature and metabolic rate more than glucose alone would.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The foods that these sugars are found in are primarily fruits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mostly fruits.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And honey and white sugar also have a little bit of fructose in them as well. So when you're looking at the glycemic index, how would you describe why diabetics should eat fruits and honey and stay away from starchy carbohydrates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 30 or 40 years ago, there was quite a bit of publishing activity relating to the anti-diabetes effects of fructose because of that stimulating effect on the metabolism. But currently, in the last three or four years, besides forgetting all of that, they're inventing a lot of new stuff to direct people away from the anti-diabetic effect of fructose.

## High Fructose Corn Syrup vs. Sugar

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Supposedly, some of the motivation for this is the popularity of what they call high fructose corn syrup. Those are more fattening than sugar, but it isn't because they are actually high in fructose. They have slightly more fructose than glucose.

However, a group in Los Angeles a few weeks ago measured the amounts in some soft drinks. They found that they accurately reported the content of fructose and glucose, but when they hydrolyzed the material, they found that there was much more carbohydrate in the drink than just the fructose and glucose. There was about four to five times as much caloric value in some kind of carbohydrate present in the drink that was not glucose or fructose. So if you have four or five times more food in your soda pop than you were thinking, you're going to be more likely to get fat—not because fructose is fattening, but just because you're getting a huge amount of pretty much the equivalent of eating flour.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So a huge amount of starch that strongly stimulates insulin, and insulin stores that starchy sugar as fat. Whereas if it was actually sucrose from white sugar, then it would be much easier for your body to store as glycogen in the liver. I know corn syrup is a hot topic, but there have also been reports that high fructose corn syrup is quite high in heavy metals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, a few years ago, some samples were analyzed and the government decided to drop it as soon as they saw that they were full of mercury. Then the industry supposedly corrected itself, but the government isn't keeping up on it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've noticed that a couple of different soda pops now are being advertised that have sugar rather than the corn syrup.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I heard that the Coke company was suing the Mexican branch to make them stop using sugar because so many Americans were importing it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I spoke to a chemist that tests products in Mexico, and she said that the Mexican Coca-Cola in Mexico will have sugar sometimes and corn syrup other times. So if you're drinking Coca-Cola in Mexico, you're not guaranteed that it is made with sugar.

## Sugar Quantities and Sources

**Andrew Murray:** I just wanted to cover the amounts. It's probably eight ounces of sugar a day?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, yeah, 250 grams is five to six ounces.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people can eat a lot more, but your appetite is a fairly good guide. Once your liver has enough glycogen, it tends to turn off your appetite for everything, not just for sugar.

**Andrew Murray:** I know last month you outlined that it takes about eight hours for the glycogen stores in the liver to be depleted.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Looking at weights and measures: one glass of orange juice contains 25 grams of sugar. One glass of milk contains 12 grams of sugar. One teaspoon of sugar only contains four grams. One tablespoon of honey contains about 17 grams. So it's easier to get a lot more sugar in fruit than it is actually in white sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And when you're eating fruit, the potassium and other minerals in the fruit really bypass the whole issue of glycemic effect. The potassium itself has an insulin-like action that helps you turn sugar into glycogen. If you ate too much, it would also produce fat, except that the presence of the potassium with your sugar means that it's going to keep your blood sugar pretty level compared to eating starches.

**Andrew Murray:** The general argument is that people defend avoiding sugar by saying sugar will make you fat. But probably what's important to bring across is that sugar will increase your metabolic rate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, a 20% increase in your metabolic rate makes a tremendous difference in how much you can eat without getting fat.

**Andrew Murray:** It's important to get the right kind of sugars—fructose, sucrose, and glucose—so that your liver has an adequate store of glycogen, rather than the sugars found in starchy carbohydrates like pastas and pastries which stimulate cortisol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things that fructose does is protect against the fat deposition effect of insulin. It not only restricts the secretion of insulin itself, but it makes insulin less harmful by blocking its tendency to produce obesity.

A publication that has been cited frequently to say that fructose is dangerous because it has an anti-insulin effect was the conclusion of a group of researchers who gave a 55-week diet to rats. They said at the end of five weeks, those who ate a gigantic amount of fructose were insulin resistant. The implication was, "See, in just five weeks we have made these animals diabetic." But the thing that doesn't get often cited is that those animals gained tremendously different amounts of weight. If you had continued that same diet for the rest of the year, the ones eating the starch would have weighed twice as much as the ones eating the sucrose diet.

## Pregnancy and Brain Development

**Andrew Murray:** Why do diabetic women have smarter, larger babies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I mentioned Zamenhof's experiments in developing chicks in the egg. He noticed that their brains stopped growing two or three days before they were ready to hatch. He saw that the glucose in the egg was depleted before the chick had finished maturing, and the brain stopped just at the time the glucose was depleted.

He knew from studies on mammals that if you give a pregnant animal either estrogen or insulin, which will lower the supply of glucose, their brain stops growing. So he made a little chip in the eggshell and injected some glucose right at the stage where the brain had stopped growing. He found that caused the brain to keep growing, and the chicken hatched with a brain bigger than chickens had ever normally had.

**Andrew Murray:** Smart chickens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In humans, they see that at about six months gestation, the brain has many more cells than it will have at birth. So from six to nine months, cells are dying rather than being created. Diabetic women are able to deliver more glucose during that time and prevent the death of this huge number of brain cells.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How do you feel when they give women who have supposedly gestational diabetes instructions to restrict their sugars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I met a woman whose doctor had told her to restrict her sugar when she was pregnant again. I asked about the development of her older boy, and she said he had taught himself to read when he was two years old. I had heard many stories like that from old obstetricians who associated that with so-called diabetes.

That caused me to look up where the idea of gestational diabetes came from. In the 60s, they were promoting the glucose tolerance test to diagnose diabetes very early. It was out of those situations, expanding the definition of diabetes, that they started noticing that most healthy pregnant women tend to have about 130 blood glucose—quite a bit above the non-pregnant normal. That simply was redefined as something off the scale of normal, and so they started thinking of pregnancy in terms of diabetes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But that's just the body's natural response when you're pregnant—to raise the sugar so the baby has more sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of the things Zamenhof did, besides adding glucose to the eggs, was adding progesterone. He found that also keeps the brain growing. It helps to stabilize and make more efficient use of glucose. Glucose and progesterone work together. Women with low progesterone tend to have unstable low blood sugar and many more problems through the pregnancy.

## Caller: Sugar, Thyroid, and Weight Loss

**Caller 1 (Gardener):** I have a lady friend who is overweight. I suspect she needs to kick up her thyroid to burn that fat. You're saying certain sugars would do that. She eats a lot of fruits and vegetables and stays away from too much carbohydrates. What's the relationship between the sugars and the thyroid being stimulated to kick up the metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your diet isn't providing either glucose or the mixture of glucose and fructose, your liver can't activate the thyroid hormone as fully. If you're living on a high protein and fat diet, your liver will slow your whole body metabolism down. That's just as effective as if your thyroid gland had shut down.

**Andrew Murray:** You're saying this because the liver converts T4, which is the inactive hormone, into T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The liver makes about 60% or 70% of the active hormone. Once your liver slows down, if you try to boost it just with the thyroxine (T4), that will tend to turn your own thyroid hormone production down. So if you're going to supplement, it has to be a balanced T3 and T4.

But often, just by avoiding the things that inhibit the conversion of thyroxine to the active form—avoiding too much muscle meat, avoiding the polyunsaturated fats, and getting enough of the pro-thyroid nutrients—you can help. Sucrose and lactose are both effective at maintaining your production of thyroid active hormones.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To summarize, that would be limiting muscle meat—steaks, burger, fish, and chicken—to a small portion. What would you recommend for an overweight person?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person really wants to concentrate on losing weight, use milk and gelatin as the main protein. Milk and gelatin are the most favorable for weight loss, partly because the milk comes with such a generous supply of calcium. Calcium powerfully stimulates the metabolic rate. Having enough salt in your food is another thing; salt and calcium interact to stimulate your metabolic rate.

The fructose in particular activates the whole range of cells, but specifically activates the production of the active thyroid hormone. Even if you're deficient in thyroid hormone, you can keep the activity going to a great extent with sucrose, salt, and calcium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's white sugar, salt, calcium, and avoiding the polyunsaturates. Those are powerfully thyroid-toxic oils found practically everywhere: corn oil, soy oil, canola, safflower, sunflower, hemp, flaxseed, fish oil, cottonseed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There was a whole series of studies that showed that polyunsaturated fats inhibit secretion from the gland by blocking the digestive proteolytic enzymes, and they block the transport in the bloodstream and at several different places in the cells. One of the enzymes that reacts to the thyroid hormone happens to be a key enzyme in the response to fructose. It's activated both by thyroid and fructose. The key respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, is activated both by thyroid and fructose. The polyunsaturated fats block these intracellular places as well as the transportation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So for the caller's friend: avoid polyunsaturated fats, replace those with coconut oil, butter, and a little bit of olive oil. Coconut oil specifically helps with weight loss. Along with lots of fruit, milk, and some cheese for protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Also, keep the intestine happy. Not eating too many raw, indigestible foods. If you have the wrong bacteria, even supposedly good fiber like grain fiber or bran can support the production of toxic chemicals in your intestine.

## Caller: Lecithin for Diabetes

**Caller 2:** I have a friend who swears by a diabetes cure of sorts. It's 400 international units of vitamin E and 1200 milligrams of lecithin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lecithin generally is made from soybeans. It could be extracted from eggs, and that would affect the composition if the eggs ate good food. But generally, lecithin is essentially the same as the polyunsaturated fats in corn oil or safflower oil. So a gram or so isn't going to make a big difference, but it does have a slightly toxic effect. I don't think it's safe. It's not very dangerous, but it's not the safest way to approach diabetes.

## Caller: Ghee and Alcohol

**Caller 3:** Along with your polyunsaturate list, you mentioned butter. Could ghee be included as well?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Actually, ghee and butter are saturated fats, so they are not thyroid toxic and they are very liver supportive. They would not be amongst that list of corn, canola, soy, etc.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In fact, these saturated fats are being researched as cures for liver disease because they're so protective to cells that are under attack from the polyunsaturated fats. Alcoholic liver disease is being treated with the highly saturated fats such as butter and waxes from palm trees.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't you tell me about a study being done regarding alcoholic hepatitis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think Northwestern University is doing it with butter. A man named Nanji is doing the most research. But there have been studies in the US earlier showing that fructose protects various organs against alcohol in pretty much the same way that it protects against diabetes. They've found that you can stimulate the removal of a toxic amount of ethyl alcohol from the body by giving a person some fructose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if someone's going to drink, they want to have a vodka and orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The fructose actually detoxifies the alcohol better than ordinary glucose.

## Caller: Fertilized Eggs

**Caller 4 (Mike):** I've heard that fertilized eggs are supposed to be better for you than non-fertilized eggs. I'd like to get your opinion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there actually could be a difference. When chickens are kept in tiny boxes where the eggs won't get fertilized, they're under extreme stress, and the stress is undoubtedly reflected in the egg. If they have the freedom of movement that would be necessary for fertilization, I think the eggs are going to be healthier.

## Caller: Cholesterol and Statins

**Caller 5:** My daughter, who is about 38, was told by her doctor that he's not happy with her cholesterol level. He says if it isn't lower in six months, he's going to put her on Lipitor. I have trepidations about Lipitor. What do you think about the cholesterol issue in itself and how much it really relates to heart disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been several studies showing that lowering cholesterol by any drug means has pretty serious side effects. That's because cholesterol is, next to glucose, probably our single most important protective all-purpose molecule. The reason it rises during stress in a fairly healthy person is that it's our defensive molecule and it's the precursor to the anti-stress hormones. It's used massively in making steroids such as pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone.

If you artificially lower the supply of cholesterol in the blood, you're going to proportionally push down the amount of progesterone you can make. That seems to be why it causes so many disastrous effects, increasing the general mortality in people who are using drugs to push down the cholesterol.

**Caller 5:** Can you tell me what some of these bad effects are of Lipitor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things that has turned up a lot in recent years is the breakdown of skeletal muscle—first pains, and then sometimes seepage of enzymes and myoglobin into the blood, damaging the kidneys.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Lipitor is a statin drug. Aren't statins really hard on your liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and it's through that effect that they affect the muscles. The muscles are destabilized if they aren't getting enough cholesterol. All of your organs, including the brain, suffer when your liver isn't supplying enough cholesterol.

**Caller 5:** Why are they so upset about cholesterol being a little on the high side?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A study of older people in nursing homes looked at their cholesterol as they aged. The longest-lived people were up around 280 milligrams of cholesterol. A Framingham study about 20 years ago saw that after the age of 50, people who have below 200 cholesterol are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. It's a very protective substance.

Since the 1930s, it's been known that hypothyroid people are susceptible to many diseases, including heart disease, and that hypothyroidism is the basic cause of increased cholesterol. Cholesterol has to be converted to progesterone under the influence of thyroid hormone. So if you're low in thyroid hormone, your body increases cholesterol to keep the progesterone production going.

**Caller 5:** My daughter actually takes thyroid medication.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The metabolic rate is a mirror image of the blood cholesterol level. As you increase your metabolic rate, your cholesterol will come down. But doctors have disregarded the effect on the metabolic rate and they prescribe only the inactive part of the thyroid hormone. Very often people stay hypometabolic despite taking thyroid.

**Caller 5:** One more quick question. Are you saying that sugars—fruit sugars and even white sugar—are okay, but the bad thing is white flour, white rice, pasta, and simple carbohydrates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. The starches and the polyunsaturated fats are the main culprits in fatness.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Another thing about cholesterol: think of it as a bandage. Dr. Peat, you told me about a Japanese study showing that arteries are blocked up by polyunsaturated fats, and the body bandages it over with a cholesterol plaque.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The unsaturated fats are very reactive with oxygen, and the bloodstream is where there's the most oxygen. The saturated fats that we make in the liver—if we eat too much sugar and are low thyroid—might cause high triglycerides, but these are saturated and they happen to be protective to the heart. The thing is to avoid the things that cause the distorted blood lipids, not to try to lower the lipids themselves, but to remove the cause.

## Artificial Sweeteners

**Andrew Murray:** The engineer has a question. She wants to know what you think of Splenda and artificial sweeteners.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Splenda is the one that has chlorine in the molecule. Exposed to bacteria, the bacteria can break down the molecule and liberate things in the family of organic chlorine compounds, like chloroform-related toxic substances. So I wouldn't want my intestine exposed to Splenda.

**Andrew Murray:** How about Stevia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's pretty safe.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So basically, you'd recommend our listeners avoid all those artificial sweeteners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Sugar is so much more nourishing and protective.

## Conclusion
