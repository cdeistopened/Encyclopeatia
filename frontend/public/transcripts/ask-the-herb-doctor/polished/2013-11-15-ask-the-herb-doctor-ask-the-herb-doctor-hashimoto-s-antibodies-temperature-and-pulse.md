## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month’s *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. My wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, herbal medicines, and dietary advice.

This month's subject is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We also have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. Dr. Peat, for those new listeners, would you mind giving a resume of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology at the University of Oregon Graduate School from 1968 to 1972. I did my dissertation on reproductive aging and oxidative processes, concentrating largely on the effects of estrogen and progesterone. I tried to explain why an excess of estrogen resembled the physiology of aging, stress, or X-ray poisoning. That was a follow-up of my interests from the 1950s on the effects of low-level radiation on public health.

## Defining Hashimoto's Thyroiditis

**Andrew Murray:** We have had a spate of people contacting us about Hashimoto's thyroiditis. I know you have a scientifically based, yet alternative view of this condition. What constitutes Hashimoto's disease in your mind, and what are the characteristic lab findings and symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A hundred years ago, Hashimoto described it as an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by infiltration of white blood cells. Some people actually stick a needle into the gland and diagnose on the basis of how he described it long ago. However, the general principle is that it is an enlarged gland that doesn't produce enough hormone.

You can make a guess as to its cause by looking at the blood. If there seems to be a deficiency of the hormone in the blood and evidence of inflammation—such as proteins and antibodies to the proteins from the thyroid gland—then they usually don't bother doing the needle biopsy.

**Andrew Murray:** So those two tests are the only real confirmation medical doctors look for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Simultaneously, a little before Hashimoto's study, people were seeing various reasons for the enlargement of the thyroid gland. Poisonings or iodine deficiency were recognized as the main causes of enlargement. Being in Japan, I suppose, was why Hashimoto saw the peculiar inflammation of the thyroid rather than blaming it on an iodine deficiency. Many people in Japan eat so much iodine that they get thyroiditis from blocking the functions of the gland. That classically results in increasing the TSH [Thyroid Stimulating Hormone] to overcome the blockage by excess iodine.

Exactly the same TSH excess is produced by a deficiency of iodine. So, what you typically see is a rising TSH driving the gland to work harder as the organism shows signs of decreasing thyroid function.

## Antibodies and Autoimmunity

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the antibodies—the anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies—I understand these are actually present in people that don't have Hashimoto's and show no symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Conversely, the identity of an antibody isn't as clear as people assume. They found a great cross-reaction between thyroid antibodies and joint antibodies. That explains why people with thyroiditis and hypothyroidism so often have arthritis and joint problems.

There is an issue with explaining disease by blaming the immune system for attacking the body. If you wrench your knee and damage the cartilage, they've done experiments in rabbits where taking a piece of foreign cartilage—like from a cow—produces very few antibodies in the rabbit. But if you twist it and structurally damage it, it produces a terrific immune reaction. Any organ that gets drained or overworked tends to leak some of its proteins. The immune system's function is largely to clean up any mess.

There is an alternative interpretation of what the immune system is doing: rather than looking for foreign invading pathogens, this theory says it is primarily cleaning up messes caused by anything pathogenic. In one of the so-called autoimmune brain conditions, people have demonstrated that the presence of the antibody to the brain tissue accelerates recovery. Cleaning up the mess is really constructive, rather than always being the cause of deterioration.

**Andrew Murray:** I've heard you mention this regarding Hepatitis C. You've questioned its existence as a virus in its own right, suggesting the antibodies measured are actually important in mopping up damage caused by insults to the liver, whether through PUFA, radiation, or other stresses.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is Duesberg's basic objection to the whole HIV theory, but it applies to Hepatitis C at least as much. Decades ago, the Egyptian government had a campaign to give a very toxic drug to the whole population to eliminate a parasite. That poison causes liver damage. Now, a tremendous proportion of the Egyptian population shows evidence of Hepatitis C, but I think it's just the after-effect of that process poisoning.

## TSH and Treatment Protocols

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of treatment, you always look at the necessity of getting the TSH down, which is normally elevated in Hashimoto's.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It has been well established in the last several years that TSH itself causes many of the symptoms blamed on hypothyroidism. It acts on the bone marrow and many other tissues, including the liver, increasing inflammatory cytokine chemicals. So, TSH in itself is a basic problem of hypothyroidism.

**Andrew Murray:** In a normal healthy person, is it a good idea to try and get the TSH as close to zero as possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My newsletter on osteoporosis a couple of years ago went over the arguments claiming TSH prevents osteoporosis. The references I provided show that basically, it is just increasing the load of inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding standard medical treatment, thyroxine (T4) is the main compound given. What do you think of its efficacy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In almost every situation, it will suppress the TSH. However, women have 5 or 10 times as much thyroid disease as men. The reason is that estrogen interferes with the liver's ability to convert thyroxine (T4) to the active T3 hormone.

The gland produces a ratio of about three parts thyroxine to one part active hormone. If the liver isn't producing T3, and you give that person big doses of thyroxine, you suppress the TSH. This turns off the little bit of active hormone coming out of their thyroid gland, and they go into an increasingly hypothyroid state. This has caused doctors to think people are simultaneously hypothyroid and hyperthyroid, which doesn't make sense unless you see that they are interfering with the liver's ability to activate the hormone.

**Andrew Murray:** So for someone presenting with Hashimoto's, is thyroxine reasonable as a treatment of choice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Especially in men. But since women are the main people who have Hashimoto's, it's very likely to bring on symptoms. It's reasonable to try it, but as soon as they start getting symptoms of worse hypothyroidism, it's time to give them the complete thyroid hormone [containing T3].

## Caller: Measuring Basal Temperature

**Caller (New Jersey):** I read Broda Barnes' book *Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness*. He suggests putting a thermometer under the arm for 10 minutes before getting out of bed. I averaged 96.4 over 18 days. However, I started measuring in subsequent 10-minute increments and found my temperature continued to rise. How do I accurately gauge my metabolic rate without flipping into Graves' disease by treating myself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It would be good if you could do it for half an hour or whatever it takes to stabilize. The trouble is that hypothyroid people have low tissue metabolism, which often goes with high adrenaline. Adrenaline cuts off circulation to your skin, fingers, and toes to keep circulation going to your brain, heart, and lungs. Especially if you are overweight, the skin and subcutaneous fat can take a couple of hours to reach core temperature because you are thoroughly insulated.

It's good to check your eardrum or mouth temperature as well as your armpit temperature, while noticing the temperature of your fingers, toes, and the tip of your nose.

**Caller (New Jersey):** Is there a significant difference in using a "basal thermometer"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are just marked so you can read them more easily in tenths, but I don't think small differences are that important. If your oral temperature is low and your fingers and toes are colder than other people's, that's a good sign your metabolic rate is low. Also, consider the calories you need per day compared to others.

The amount of water you evaporate is a very good indicator. A person should take in two quarts more fluid than they lose per day in urine. That two quarts would be average evaporation if your thyroid is good. Many hypothyroid people evaporate less than a quart a day, meaning they are waterlogged.

Checking your pulse rate and the temperature of your fingers and toes in a cool room are more sensitive indicators.

**Caller (New Jersey):** I'm in a heated room when I do this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even a dead person will be warm in a hot room. The best single test would be the Basal Metabolic Rate from the 1930s—measuring how much oxygen you breathe in and how much carbon dioxide you exhale. Temperature is just a rough approximation of how much fuel you're burning.

You also have to notice changes during the day. Low thyroid people typically compensate with stress hormones increasing—adrenaline, cortisol, serotonin, histamine. These make your tissues metabolize in an energy-wasting way. Adrenaline makes your skin cold. Cortisol breaks down muscle and glandular tissue to turn it into sugar, which heats your body up. Some people wake up with a 98 or 99-degree temperature, but after they eat breakfast, by 10:00 or 11:00 AM, their temperature might fall to 94 or 95 degrees.

## Interpreting Temperature and Pulse Patterns

**Andrew Murray:** Let's dig into the interpretation of temperature and pulse. If someone has a high starting temperature in the morning before getting out of bed, and then it falls after breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I first noticed this in a friend who cycled between depression and mania. During manic periods where she slept very little, her morning temperatures were extremely high. After eating, they would fall several degrees. She was under the influence of too much adrenaline. I suggested she take enough thyroid to stabilize her pulse and temperature. Within a few days, her morning temperature was lower, but it increased after eating instead of decreasing.

**Andrew Murray:** So, cold extremities would be driven by adrenaline acting as a vasoconstrictor, yet core temperature is high due to cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If cortisol is extremely high, you are making enough heat to keep hands and feet warm. But if you have a very high temperature and normal pulse, and then the temperature falls after eating, your pulse will probably get slower still.

**Andrew Murray:** What about a low starting temperature in the morning that falls after breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is still stress plus hypothyroidism.

**Andrew Murray:** And if they have a low starting temperature that stays the same after breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They probably didn't eat the right things. If you get enough sugar, protein, and essential catalytic nutrients (like B vitamins), and if you have any thyroid function at all, feeding the liver sugar should start producing a little T3, which would warm you.

**Andrew Murray:** What about pulses? If someone has a low pulse in bed that rises after breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That probably means T3 is going up from eating carbohydrates and increasing general energy. I've seen this in women who are premenstrual with high estrogen blocking their thyroid. They get cold when hungry, and everything slows down. When they eat, they warm up and the pulse increases.

**Andrew Murray:** What if they have a high pulse in the morning that rises after breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes that happens when they eat eggs without enough carbohydrate. If you are hypoglycemic, eating eggs stimulates insulin, drops blood sugar further, and causes a surge of adrenaline. If you feel good when the pulse goes up, you're increasing thyroid. If you feel faint or shaky, that's shock from too much protein without carbohydrate.

Some people wake up cyclically during the night. I advised people to set an alarm to wake up shortly before their usual waking time and eat something with carbohydrate—milk, juice, or a cracker. Within a week, they were sleeping through the night. The stress hormones that raise temperature and pulse around dawn also increase blood sugar—diabetics call it the "Dawn Phenomenon," but it's the result of stress hormones rising during the night.

**Andrew Murray:** And a high pulse that falls after breakfast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's good. That is the carbohydrate lowering the adrenaline. When the temperature goes up and pulse goes down, that's what breakfast should do.

## Caller: Radiation Protection

**Caller:** I have a question about the approaching Fukushima radiation plume. What should we do to prevent damage? Seaweed? Iodine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My first newsletter 30 years ago was on radiation defense. Research has confirmed that keeping your metabolic rate up accelerates the repair process faster than the injury. Progesterone decreases the injury, and thyroid increases the rate of repair.

All kinds of stress create signals from injured cells that travel through the body. Russian researchers noticed that total body irradiation had an estrogenic effect. Estrogen and radiation produce toxins that communicate to all cells. That's why thyroid and progesterone have a protective effect.

Regarding nutritional support, magnesium is the element most closely involved in repairing radiation damage. After your thyroid is activated, cells take up magnesium, and enzymes are activated to do the repair.

**Andrew Murray:** That would be from the green leafy broths you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Afternoon Temperature and Immune Function

**Andrew Murray:** Are morning changes reflective of similar metabolism seen in lunchtime temperature and pulses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If your temperature hasn't stabilized by 10:00 or 11:00 AM, a low thyroid person—especially a woman with high estrogen—might see temperature and pulse fall before lunch, or have an adrenaline attack.

**Andrew Murray:** If the temperature never reaches 98.6 or the pulse never gets over 70 in the mid-afternoon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have their chronic adaptation and can stay well at those numbers, but you have the greatest ability to resist stress and recuperate if your temperature and pulse are a little above average.

**Andrew Murray:** And if the temperature is higher than 98.6 in the afternoon and pulse is over 100?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The optimum temperature for the brain and immune system seems to be around 101 degrees, maybe even a little higher.

**Andrew Murray:** So if your temperature doesn't reach 98.6, you aren't running at 100% of your immune ability?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably. Usually, you can see evidence in blood tests, such as unnecessarily high TSH or other pituitary hormones, indicating you are driving your endocrine and immune systems unnecessarily hard. When things run smoothly on the cellular level, the endocrine and immune systems don't have to do very much.

## Caller: Valerian for Sleep

**Caller (Redway):** I recently started taking Valerian tincture for sleep. It's really helpful. Is there a possibility of developing a dependence, or is it contraindicated?

**Andrew Murray:** Valerian works on GABA channels. Some people get stimulated by it, but the majority find benefit. Dr. Peat, what do you think about Valerian and the mechanism behind insomnia, which you usually attribute to high adrenaline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That mechanism is very good. It's a very safe drug, but using a drug of that sort is potentially habit-forming.

My own experience when I took thyroid was being able to relax and sleep soundly. I once met a doctor who hadn't slept for three nights. I gave him 10 micrograms of Cytomel [T3]. The next night he told me, "That stuff is better than morphine."
