## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, my wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

This month we had a small amount to finish up from last month's show on misdiagnosis of thyroid conditions, but something came into the limelight that Dr. Peat has spent a long time researching in his own academic career: the aging process.

I saw an article in the health section of the BBC News titled "US Scientists have performed a dramatic reversal of the aging process in animal studies." The article said they used a chemical to rejuvenate the muscles in mice, equivalent to transforming a 60-year-old's muscle to that of a 20-year-old. They noted that muscle strength did not improve immediately, but the general quality or health of the muscle became that of a 20-year-old.

Their study in the journal *Cell* identified an entirely new mechanism of aging and then reversed it. Their research focused on a chemical called NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Its levels naturally drop off in the cell with age. The team showed that this disrupted the function of the mitochondria, leading to lower energy production. Experiments showed that boosting NAD levels could reverse this. One week of medication in two-year-old mice meant their muscles became akin to those of a six-month-old in terms of mitochondrial function, muscle wastage, inflammation, and insulin resistance.

Thanks so much for joining us this month again, Dr. Peat. Would you give people that may be new listeners an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 60s, I had been working in linguistics, but on my own, I was studying general questions of aging and the brain—in particular, how the brain makes consciousness and language possible, and how that changes during maturation and aging. I enrolled at the University of Oregon thinking I would study brain biology in 1968. I found that the brain biology people were extremely dogmatic, thinking only in terms of genetic control and membrane functions.

I looked around the department and found that the reproductive biologists seemed to be more scientific and actually looking for an explanation, rather than trying to explain things in terms of what they believed they knew. So, I worked on reproductive aging. Our lab specialized in female aging, and I concentrated on the energy oxidative metabolism and the changes occurring in the uterus with aging.

I found that all kinds of stress converged with the changes that you see during aging, especially in the reproductive system. The lining of the uterus was a very good model for things that happen in the brain and the whole organism. All types of stress—from radiation to bad diet, Vitamin E deficiency, or deficiency of oxygen—mimicked the changes that you see in aging. Basically, that's the area that I've been thinking about a lot ever since.

## Epigenetics and Gene Expression

**Andrew Murray:** The article talks about the interaction with DNA, specifically methylation as an additive process which degrades the DNA, and acetylation which is apparently more protective. They talk about an epigenetic modification. Unlike most modern thinking that tells us we are a result of our genetics and there's nothing we can do, you have found research proving that the environment has effects on the genes, even in a relatively short space of time. When articles talk about epigenetic modification involved in gene expression—for example, to stave off cancer or allow the cancer to exist—would you explain what that is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Luther Burbank was a person who explored the influence of the environment. Many biologists, from the time of Lamarck down through Barbara McClintock—who was ignored until just about 20 years ago—demonstrated that the need for a function could elicit the function in an organism. A stressful environment would cause changes in the chromosomes. Barbara McClintock referred to "jumping genes," but these were actual movements of DNA elicited by stress in the environment.

These people were excluded from science by a very dogmatic view of genetics. All of the dogmatic views of the geneticists of the 20th century are now completely defunct, but they live on in the practice of medicine. Last year, several dozen people asked me what to do because they discovered they are a "mutant" by having a DNA test. There are a couple of popular genes that almost everyone has a mutated form of, but actually, these make almost no difference in health or function—perhaps a very slight nutritional requirement difference.

If you look at identical twins, despite the fact that all of their DNA is identical and they experience the same environment in the uterus, when you look at a serious disease, there's very little overlap. For example, if one twin has rheumatoid arthritis, there's only a 12% incidence of it in the other twin. That's now well recognized, but the gene testing industry is still trying to sell the idea that you get sick if you have certain mutated genes.

**Andrew Murray:** You're saying it's more a product of the environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Perhaps. They put 40 mice in a stimulating environment and found that just by the choices they made in their daily life, they became very different in personality and behavior. This was just based on where they happened to go in the environment influencing what they learned. Over their lifetime, they became very recognizable individuals. That would really upset medicine if they had to consider everyone as a unique individual all the way down to the way their genes work.

**Andrew Murray:** I wonder what it is in the animals in that study that made the individual mice do things differently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Possibly just which one was the first to be weaned and wander off and have an experience that stimulated them in a way that the others didn't experience. The genes are being used constantly. Everything you do is using your genes in a certain way that varies according to whether you're awake or asleep.

But if you're starving day after day, this is going to pull up an accumulation of changes—not just a quick on-and-off effect—but it will accumulate change, sort of an inertia. Layer after layer will be laid down in the stuff around your genes, attaching carbon atoms to the DNA itself and attaching a great variety of molecules to the proteins that handle the genes (the histones). These are relatively easy to change. The methylation is a little more sluggish. When you're in an extremely stressful situation, a lot of your genes get turned off—methylated especially. Those can be identified in the chromosomes that you inherit from your father or mother specifically. If your father had a very hard life, you can identify the highly methylated genes in your chromosomes that came from that hard life.

**Andrew Murray:** So that's inheritable then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In animal experiments, it takes several generations for a very bad generation's experience to be removed when they're put into a normal environment. But if you put them into a super environment—like the enriched environment—you can repair the previous generation's damage very quickly. Some nutrients and drugs can do that: remove methyl groups from the DNA and attach more of the opening groups to the histones.

## Caloric Restriction vs. Nutrition

**Andrew Murray:** There is a train of thought that fasting is good for you and going without is healthful—that if you starve yourself regularly and live on a meager caloric intake, you'll have a greater chance of longevity. It's not actually true, is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. About 70 years ago, a researcher named Clive McCay showed that restricting the food supply made animals live longer. But later, people restricted the *type* of food—kept down the heavy metals in their diet alone—and let them eat all the fat, protein, and carbohydrate they wanted, and they lived longer.

## Caller: Gina from Kansas City

**Gina:** My question is about estrogen and if there are any herbs that can function as an aromatase inhibitor. I am in a high estrogen state. I'm in my 40s, but I am already post-menopausal; I entered menopause very early at about age 40. I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's and gained 40 pounds in just three years. My progesterone is very low, even though I am supplementing. My FSH and LH are very high. Even though the blood test shows the estrogen is low, I believe it's trapped in the cells. Since I can't raise the progesterone even with supplementation and diet (raw carrots, low fiber), would you suggest taking something as an aromatase inhibitor?

**Andrew Murray:** The main aromatase inhibitor I'm familiar with is nettle root, used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy in men.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost everyone around the age of 40 has the highest ratio of estrogen to progesterone. The trouble is, the estrogen seems to drop when you measure it in the serum, even though it was at its very highest lifetime level around age 40. When progesterone falls, the estrogen can't be released from the cell, so it doesn't appear in the serum until progesterone affects the cells to release it.

Even without taking something to increase your progesterone, aromatase inhibitors are very practical. Two fruits that contain effective aromatase inhibitors are oranges (naringenin) and guavas (apigenin). Aspirin helps by blocking the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. The supplement pregnenolone is indirectly able to increase your progesterone and lower estrogen production.

**Gina:** The pregnenolone is a precursor to DHEA, correct? My DHEA levels are quite high. Would taking pregnenolone make it even higher?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. When your estrogen is not being controlled, it likely over-activates your adrenals. DHEA tends to go up with cortisol, and cortisol is a major activator of aromatase. The function of pregnenolone is to lower the excess cortisol and prevent the overstimulation of aromatase.

**Gina:** Since DHEA is also a precursor to estrogen, how would I keep it from producing even more estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes the pregnenolone in itself can do that by lowering the stress hormones which drive the adrenal glands too hard. The diet to correct your low thyroid function is probably the basic thing. Estrogen causes inflammation of the thyroid gland; it inhibits the ability to secrete thyroid hormone while allowing it to synthesize it. Progesterone is needed for the gland to secrete. You want to do things that lower the stress on your thyroid. Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) are probably the most important factor in blocking the thyroid, other than estrogen.

**Gina:** I have eliminated those now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium in the diet is a very important thing for keeping your metabolic rate up and helping to lose weight. Two quarts of low-fat milk will provide a pretty ideal amount of calcium.

**Gina:** Would that amount be influenced by the fact that I have low stomach acid and no gallbladder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With 1% milk, there's enough to slow the absorption of the sugar and protein slightly, but not enough fat to upset your gallbladder.

## Caller: David from Missouri

**David:** I've been experimenting with red light using heat lamps—like a chicken light from a hardware store with a reflector—to get more light each day since we are near the winter equinox. A lot of problems could be coming from the low light situation.

I also have a question about aspirin. It seems like commercial brands have a lot of additives. I've explored getting pure aspirin, but it looks like the only place to buy it is through pet supply places. What do you think about using willow bark instead?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fillers definitely aren't good. If you have access to nothing but the pills, I think you should dissolve them in hot water to let the junk settle out and then just drink the sour water.

**David:** I also wanted to ask about pressure cooking and canning. I'm thinking about canning potatoes, kale, garlic, onion, and ground lamb in mason jars.

**Andrew Murray:** The main thought about that is the onion and garlic. Some people are fairly sensitive to it. It's like people eating a lot of vegetables and having flatulence—it's actually not good for you.

**David:** Do you think the nutrition aspects of canning would harm the foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. There were experiments in the 1940s in which rats were fed canned vegetables—corn, beans, etc.—and others were fed the same vegetables fresh and raw. The animals eating canned vegetables thrived; the others didn't. Well-cooked green leaves are extremely good nutritionally, especially to balance meat, because the greens contain very little phosphate and the meat contains too much phosphate and too little calcium.

**David:** One last thing: Calcium chloride. I buy a brand of pickles that has very few ingredients other than calcium chloride.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has a nice taste when added to food, but a lot of people are sensitive either to magnesium chloride or calcium chloride. It can cause headaches and bowel symptoms. If it's chemically pure, it's good as a food additive, provided you aren't sensitive.

## Methylation, NAD, and Cancer Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, the caller mentioned the importance of light.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even light can help to reverse the toxic methylation that happens from stress.

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of methylation being a bad process that happens to genes, are there other things that would be counterproductive or useful to use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people who have been told they have mutated genes are being told by doctors to eat lots of methyl groups—choline and methionine—to make up for the weak gene enzyme. However, the American College of Medical Genetics recently said that mutation doesn't call for treatment; it's not clinically significant. They didn't mention that people with that so-called mutation have a lower incidence of cancer. This probably relates to what we're talking about: the epigenetic methylation of the genes. People who have a slightly weaker methylation system are better off regarding cancer risk.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to bring out two compounds that are anesthetics: lidocaine and procaine. They have a demethylation activity for the DNA, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. These are being studied in several types of cancer—prostate, breast, pancreas, lung, and melanoma. Its effects are dramatic for reversing those changes characteristic of the cancer. It's being considered an important new approach to cancer treatment, but it's so cheap that no one is enthusiastic about applying to the FDA.

**Andrew Murray:** The BBC article mentioned NAD being the molecule responsible for reversal. Can this be synthesized from tryptophan? I've heard you mention excess tryptophan is not good.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Women in particular are very susceptible to too much tryptophan. They used to be the victims of pellagra much more often than men. That's because estrogen redirects the metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin rather than niacin or niacinamide. When corn is treated with alkali (nixtamalization) to make hominy or tortillas, the chemistry shifts it over in that pathway to make niacin and doesn't let so much serotonin be formed.

**Andrew Murray:** How about aspartic acid? I saw that was a good source from which NAD can be synthesized, specifically from asparagus juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You don't want to take plain aspartic acid because it's an excitotoxin in itself. But asparagus juice is fine.

Another amino acid being promoted on the internet is arginine or citrulline to increase nitric oxide. That's going exactly in the wrong direction epigenetically. Vitamin B6 is needed to prevent tryptophan from being turned into too much serotonin and to help turn it into niacinamide. Simply supplementing niacinamide is a very direct way to help reverse these epigenetic problems.

Five years ago, when the Harvard people were starting a drug company called Sirtris (which was bought by Glaxo and then dumped), they were promoting resveratrol. They warned that niacinamide antagonized resveratrol and lowered sirtuins, claiming niacinamide would accelerate aging. I think now they've changed their story. Even five years ago, it was clear that niacinamide greatly extended cell life—a tremendous increase in human cell longevity *in vitro*. It's very safe, so it can be used in all of these epigenetic problems: Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and various types of cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** I read that aspirin enhances the deacetylation of histones. What do you think about the co-administration of aspirin along with a deacetylase inhibitor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it works by itself or with any of the other protective inhibitors. Caffeine has some of the same effects. Aspirin and caffeine have been used together in a lot of products. They seem to work synergistically rather than interfering with each other.

## Lidocaine and Tissue Memory

**Andrew Murray:** We had a question about the use of lidocaine for cancer and how it is administered.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** These studies have been done in many different ways, but I've had several random experiences with both procaine and lidocaine that were amazing. For example, a girl with lifetime terrible eczema—red and scaly all over—put a handful of rubbing alcohol with some novocaine in it and stroked it up her shin. At the same speed that her hand moved up her shin, a wave of normal-looking skin appeared right behind it and stayed that way.

I've seen people with terrible burns; if they could get it on in the first minute or so, the burn stopped and didn't develop. It has antihistamine and anti-serotonin effects, stopping inflammation in its tracks. But what it's doing is undoing the limiting and harmful genetic changes caused by injury.

**Andrew Murray:** It's almost as if the perception of pain itself accelerates the damage. If you can block the signaling of pain, you can greatly reduce the symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's like the nerves increase the release of the inflammatory materials.

## Caller: Marquesa

**Marquesa:** A couple of years ago, I scalded my abdomen with hot oil while cooking chicken. A bulbous blister formed. Since that time, I've had blisters form again and again in the same location at intervals. If I put adhesive tape on that area, the skin comes off.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This sounds like a genetic imprinting or memory. I think the nervous system is probably involved in helping with the memory. There is a branch of medicine called neural therapy which involved finding key points and injecting procaine or other local anesthetics to change the nervous system. I've seen a great variety of good results from applying local anesthetics topically. It apparently helps to retrain the memory of the tissue so that it stops producing the recurrent problem.

There are strong local anesthetic ointments sold over the counter. Benzocaine in a small area is effective and safe, but you don't want to use a lot of benzocaine on a big area. Procaine and lidocaine are safer.

## Emodin and Cascara

**Andrew Murray:** We were talking about emodin and another laxative from cascara being used to suppress bladder cancer cell growth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the molecule for Pau d'Arco (lapacho), vitamin K, emodin, and tetracycline, they are essentially the same structure with a different number of rings. Each one is an analog of the other and has overlapping properties: anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-stress.

About 10 or 15 years ago, the FDA was attacking laxatives of that class, such as aloe and cascara, as potential causes of cancer. But as soon as they took it off the market, the cancer industry started getting interested in it. It relieves or cures many kinds of cancer and turns out not to have any of the harmful effects the FDA was claiming. Its mechanism seems to involve not only the usual anti-inflammatory things but a real basic reprogramming—demethylation and inhibiting the histone deacetylase enzymes.
