## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. Sarah is not with us tonight, so we're doing the show with Dr. Raymond Peat as a regular guest, continuing the last two months' topic of the endocrine system.

I'd like to break at some point during the show to intersperse some questions that have been emailed to us. Also, there is a latest newsletter from Dr. Peat. For those interested in his work, there is a lot of information available on the web. I've been amazed at how the web has exploded the availability of knowledge in all areas. Dr. Peat’s discussions on politics, science, and health are available all over the internet, as are these broadcasts.

For people who haven't heard about Dr. Peat, there is plenty of information at our website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com, under the Resources tab. This month's newsletter is a continuation and exposé of COVID, but now disclosing the CIA and other foundational groups that are ruling the top tier of society and molding the system to follow its edicts. Obviously, that comes with a lot of tyranny. To resist tyranny is a call to arms—not necessarily with violence, but by immersing yourself in alternative education. Knowledge is a powerful weapon against tyrants.

Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for your time. We will go through the endocrine system and then take caller questions.

## Prolactin, Lactation, and Thyroid Function

**Andrew Murray:** Where we left off last month, we were discussing the hypothalamus. You discussed thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates TSH from the anterior pituitary as well as prolactin. Prolactin is the hormone responsible for lactation.

Is there a mechanism to satisfy TSH production in low-thyroid individuals that does not result in increased prolactin production? In low-thyroid individuals, is there a potential for women to be exposed to higher than normal levels of prolactin? Have you known women to lactate when they weren't nursing or fertile?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I have talked to probably 100 women where hypothyroidism was their basic problem, but unwelcome lactation was one of their symptoms. Usually, there were menstrual irregularities at the same time—either too much or too little menstruation. Just correcting their thyroid function took care of the lactation and menstruation both.

It is partly regulating oxygen metabolism so that you can use your fuel very efficiently and keep your blood sugar steady so that you don't experience stress. In good health, estrogen is produced for about 12 hours once a month in a big surge to create tissue stress, stir up cell division, and prepare the uterus and the breast.

Low thyroid, by letting you get low blood sugar inappropriately, activates the stress hormones. It also inactivates the parts of the liver that normally destroy estrogen as soon as it reaches the liver. Normally, the small amount of estrogen being produced under moderate stress is kept very low by an active liver. When the thyroid is low, estrogen tends to rise. Both of these create an oxygen deficiency and a glucose deficiency. One intensifies the other, and these are the first steps in any kind of stress reaction.

The stress reaction turns on your pituitary to organize the adaptive system of the body. In fish, prolactin regulates salt and water metabolism. Mammals have the various components of milk formation involving the flow of water, salts, proteins, and sugar. Prolactin in all animals has a range of anti-stress functions, and lactation is just a useful component for handling the stress of pregnancy.

## Estrogen and Stress

**Andrew Murray:** I picked up on what you said about estrogen being a once-monthly, 12-hour surge. It seems a very ubiquitous poison that women are continually subjected to. How do you compare that to the background levels of estrogen that you advise women to protect themselves from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any tissue of your body that is stressed will start to produce estrogen. It's a very basic reaction to stress. With aging, when you've lost some of your basic anti-stress hormones—thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone—all of your tissues suffer from oxygen and glucose deficiencies. That means all of your tissues will begin producing a little bit of estrogen. For example, the post-menopausal breast tissue produces several times more estrogen than it does during menstruation.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the liver slows down because the thyroid is low, then that little bit being produced by any stressed tissue is going to pile up in the blood because it should be eliminated constantly through the liver and kidney.

**Andrew Murray:** When I was studying, I was under the impression that the ovaries were the main estrogen-secreting organ in the female body, and men didn't really have estrogen. But hearing that, you said any cell can essentially secrete estrogen in response to stress and inflammation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Old men get low testosterone because their stressed tissue is turning it quickly into estrogen. A younger man who is very sick or has an accident will have very high estrogen. That will usually bring up prolactin, growth hormone, and a lot of adaptive secondary hormones.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding lactation and prolactin in females, is it a quantitative issue where there's not enough prolactin being stimulated? Or is oxytocin a more powerful stimulator of lactation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oxytocin is really just to release the milk once it's formed. It isn't involved in directly forming it. When I was a little kid during the Depression, there were very poor people moving into Southern California. One family we knew had been starving for years. The mother found a job when they had a baby a few months old, and the father was able to lactate to nurse the baby while the mother was at work.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you see any difference in the quality of the milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Men aren't nearly as good at lactating—maybe not as much fat. It's a very extreme thing. Lots of men, when they came out of the World War II prison camps, started eating and got enough energy to mobilize cortisol and some thyroid. They began lactating because they had injured their tissues so much that they were very high in estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** It is well documented that gynecomastia (male breasts) is a common phenomenon in males exposed to estrogen. In England, it's not uncommon for men who drink a lot of beer daily to grow breasts. Is that related to the hops or environmental mimics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeast can produce estradiol. They think the yeast fermenting is a major source of the breast development in beer drinkers. They are probably more harmful than the hops.

## Cortisol and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary, which acts on the adrenals to promote cortisol. Most people have heard of cortisol, cortisone, or hydrocortisone being used to control inflammation.

Natural cortisol production is inhibited by negative feedback, so we aren't normally chronically exposed to it. What dangers do you see in the chronic use of hydrocortisone, either topically or aerosolized? What would be a better approach to quell inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Within the first two or three hours of a big dose of cortisol or synthetic glucocorticoids, the thymus gland starts shrinking, and the skin and muscles begin shrinking. Cortisol shifts the metabolism in the opposite direction of testosterone. They activate the proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins and inhibit the anabolic protein-synthesizing mechanisms.

The brain, heart, and lungs are very concentrated testosterone metabolizers and retainers. If you give someone radioactive testosterone, you see the emission from those organs—most of it from the heart and brain. The testosterone is there protecting these vital organs. But when you give a big dose of cortisol, you swamp that protective effect of progesterone and testosterone. The tissues that aren't very well protected very quickly shrink. Your skin becomes thinner, blood vessels weaken, and you tend to get little bloody spots (petechial hemorrhages) and bruise very easily.

Lots of women have constantly bruised thighs and upper arms. If they are low in thyroid and progesterone, they compensate with increased cortisol, which weakens their small blood vessels. If that continues over the years, it leads to strokes, osteoporosis, and typical aging conditions.

**Andrew Murray:** I've known people in England who have been on corticosteroid inhalants for asthma or creams for eczema for years. You're saying it essentially switches off the protective anti-excitotoxic mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and asthma is one of the typical estrogen-induced inflammations. High-estrogen women are very susceptible to asthma, especially during the night. One of the effects of estrogen is to directly stimulate the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. High estrogen leads to weak blood vessels, shrinking bones, aging skin, and low immunity by the shrinking effect of cortisol on the thymus gland.

Estrogen shifts the balance toward serotonin and away from dopamine. This shift is one of the things that activates the prolactin system. Serotonin is also one of the major activators of the corticotropin-releasing hormone. So estrogen activates the pituitary, the hypothalamus, and the adrenal glands directly to increase the tissue breakdown effect.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned female asthmatics getting worse at night. Is this nighttime stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, all of the stress hormones rise during the night. Hypoglycemia or disturbed oxygen availability increase both prolactin and usually growth hormone. Stress induces, I think, all of the pituitary hormones except for luteinizing hormone (LH), the one that produces testosterone and progesterone. When you activate all the other parts of the pituitary, you're likely to become sterile by losing your progesterone and testosterone.

**Andrew Murray:** For the guys listening, testosterone is extremely important. It is the counterpart to estrogen and the route by which inflammation is quelled.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's close enough in function to progesterone in protective tissues that they've experimented with removing the ovaries from rats after they've been impregnated and giving them testosterone during pregnancy. It is a progestin in the sense of being able to sustain pregnancy in the absence of ovaries.

## Caller: Hormones and Gender Perception

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our first caller. You're on the air.

**Caller 1:** I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area. Can an imbalance of hormones influence someone's perception of his or her gender? I've heard of instances like Caitlyn Jenner, where they knew from a very young age. What's your take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When that happens during gestation or in the first few months after being born, the actual cell structure of the brain is still developing. It is either masculinized or not by the presence of testosterone, which is turned into estrogen. Estrogen, in those stages of development, is the masculinizing hormone. A deficiency of progesterone early in life leaves the estrogen unopposed and tends to masculinize the brain. It can set up the feeling of the gender that is chemically activated rather than what the chromosomes were able to do.

## Caller: Transhumanism and Hair

**Andrew Murray:** Next caller, you're on the air.

**Caller 2:** I'm calling from Finland. I've been reading your *Generative Energy* book. It prompted me to think about transhumanism—robotic hands, brain chips, etc. Do you believe this transhumanism might fit into future evolutions of man regarding the trend toward maximum metabolism and energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the technology is so simplified compared to what actually is needed by the organism to maximize its metabolism, function, and experience. I don't think technology is going to have a role in the future development of health, longevity, or brain development.

**Andrew Murray:** I think the human body and the psyche play a much bigger part. Positive thinking, self-empowerment, and nutrition give us a far better chance of living a genetically healthy life that can be passed on. Transhumanism is temporal; it can't be transmitted.

**Caller 2:** Can I ask a follow-up? We're in an increasingly hairless society. People want to shave more regularly. How stressful is frequent shaving to the body?

**Andrew Murray:** I just read an article that said hairiness in females is becoming more recognized and accepted. Dr. Peat, what do you think?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the hair on the head actually has the function of preserving heat, helping to keep the brain warm. Wearing a wool hat will substitute somewhat for not having enough hair on the head. Armpit and pubic hair have the function of helping to distribute pheromones. But I think the body hair that is tending to appear more often in women is a sign of stress. It's probably related to that pheromone system shifting to an exaggerated steroid production in the skin.

## Testosterone and Muscle Building

**Andrew Murray:** To carry on with testosterone for the males listening: in terms of men maximizing testosterone without pumping huge amounts of weights, what is a good program to increase lean muscle mass?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Muscle contraction activates the synthesis locally in the muscle of testosterone and decreases cortisol activity. So, good physical work is probably the central thing to keeping your testosterone up. It shouldn't be episodic, intense, stressful work that is known to lower your testosterone and increase cortisol. At the same time, keep your metabolic rate up so you can do more intense activity without it being stressful. Having your liver very healthy is essential because otherwise, the episodes of falling blood sugar activate cortisol, estrogen, and all the other stress hormones.

**Andrew Murray:** So, stocking your liver with plenty of sugar, avoiding aerobic approaches to exercise, and ideally doing physical work.

## Dopamine and Parkinson's

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to dopamine. We've discussed Parkinson's. Dopamine inhibits prolactin release and regulates emotional responses, reward, and pleasure. Lack of dopamine has been implicated in addiction. Does this imply that many addicts have naturally low levels of dopamine and may develop Parkinson's later? Would dopamine supplementation be useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even in Parkinson's disease, studies are moving toward thinking of a balance between serotonin and dopamine.

**Andrew Murray:** So you're thinking serotonin excess might exacerbate it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they are somewhat antagonistic. For example, serotonin increases CRH and prolactin; dopamine tends to inhibit them. Nitric oxide, endotoxin, and serotonin all shift your body toward distress. Progesterone and its derivatives in the brain, like allopregnenolone, are important for keeping the balance in the right direction. Estrogen increases serotonin and stress; progesterone tends to reverse that and increase the balance toward dopamine.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think this would be a cause for Parkinson's down the road if people have addictive natures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you can correct it most safely with progesterone and testosterone, or the precursor of both, pregnenolone. When you try to push the dopamine system directly, you tend to increase oxidative damage. It's safer to work at the anti-stress level rather than pushing the end product of dopamine.

## Growth Hormone and Sleep

**Andrew Murray:** Growth hormone-releasing hormone stimulates growth hormone, which regulates metabolism and promotes slow-wave sleep (deep sleep). I read that slow-wave sleep was implicated in nightmares and sleepwalking, especially sleepwalking to raid the fridge. Do you think the deep sleep connection is real?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think deep sleep is important as a restorative part of your brain function. I think a lot of people would be happier and healthier if they would eat during the night. People who resist eating near bedtime or during the night often have more stress and more hypoglycemic insomnia. Most people can get back to sleep if they have orange juice, lemonade, or ice cream.

**Andrew Murray:** There is a cultural barrier where people feel if they eat close to bedtime, they will put on fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very important to restore your glycogen level during sleep. I think that's one of the main purposes of sleep—to get the glycogen back into your brain and heart cells so you can expend it to resist stress during the daytime.

## Listener Questions: Cancer and Gums

**Andrew Murray:** I have a question from a listener: "Did Jimmy Carter's cancer cure have anything to do with receptors? Isn't the entire cell a receptor?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think he was having standard chemotherapy for a while, then brain radiation, and then he got this new antibody that is specific for allowing cells to undergo normal apoptosis. Statistically, it doesn't look like it was a terribly impressive cure because the number of people studied was not very big, and the percentage who responded well—I think it was 24%—had a temporary regression. That happened in a lot of the people who had only the preceding brain radiation.

**Andrew Murray:** Another question: "Since gums like carrageenan and xanthan gum are toxic, does the same apply to gums like frankincense and myrrh?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carrageenan and xanthan are basically polysaccharides. Carrageenan is a sulfated polysaccharide, and I think all of the sulfated polysaccharides, besides our own heparin, are toxic and dangerous. Xanthan gums and gum arabic are not digestible but can support bacterial growth in the intestine. Where carrageenan is specifically pro-inflammatory and dangerous, the other gums are simply nuisances that tend to increase bacterial growth and gas.

Frankincense and myrrh contain lots of anti-inflammatory substances, probably anti-cancer effects, and some steroid-like molecules not so different from testosterone and progesterone. They seem to have an anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation effect on cancer cells.

**Andrew Murray:** On the issue of receptors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are actual proteins called receptor proteins. But my position is that since the condition of the cell determines what a particular substance binding to that receptor is going to do, it isn't as meaningful as some people think to "activate a receptor," because it can have opposite effects depending on the history of the cell.

## Stem Cells

**Andrew Murray:** What is your view on stem cell technology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think we're full of stem cells, and what we have to do is activate them intelligently.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think the research is going in the right direction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Finding out exactly what the stress signal is that activates them is key. It's already known that many types of stress will activate the maturing of stem cells, and that things like progesterone and testosterone, once they have been activated, will keep them going in the right direction so that they replace tissues rather than replacing cancer.

When they kill cancer by radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery, the cancer tends to come back even though they remove the tumor completely because the place where the cancer was has been injured. It calls out to the body for stem cells to repair the damage. Being damaged itself as a framework, it misdirects the stem cells so they develop into cancer.

## Caller: Gut Health and Nutrition

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller 3 (Derek):** I'm in Denver. I've been looking into gut permeability and food intolerances. A lot of protocols involve avoiding nutrient-dense foods like eggs and dairy. I know you talk about the carrot salad, but are there other compounds you like to incorporate to heal the lining of the intestines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nutrients that are most important are magnesium and Vitamin A, just for the actual replacement and repair of cells. But the whole range of nutrients—protein, zinc, Vitamin D, anti-inflammatory things like Vitamin E and Vitamin K—everything is essential for protecting the intestine. Having liver, eggs, milk, and orange juice can often get the repair going.

I think the reason eggs have a bad reputation is that they are extremely concentrated protein. If a person eats an egg or two without carbohydrate, their blood sugar is going to fall for sure, especially if their liver doesn't have good glycogen stores. The egg will drop their blood sugar, which activates mast cells, and you'll have allergic reactions. Any pure protein without carbohydrate will increase inflammation. Sugar, progesterone, and aspirin are things that will protect you from those surges of histamine and serotonin.

**Caller 3:** Does the histamine get produced because you don't have enough glycogen due to a cortisol spike?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid ultimately is the most common reason for not having enough glycogen stored. Cortisol weakens the tissues so that even though it helps get your blood sugar up momentarily, in the long run, it adds to the problem of unstable blood sugar. Anytime your blood sugar falls, the mast cells are likely to degranulate, and that's influenced by a lack of testosterone and progesterone or an excess of estrogen.

**Caller 3:** Is lack of thyroid hormone often a root cause of small bowel overgrowth (SIBO)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Your digestion slows down when your metabolic rate slows down from hypothyroidism. So your stomach becomes sluggish, doesn't secrete much, and doesn't move fast enough. People might eat a carrot today and it might not come out for four or five days. Speeding up your digestion and secretions—streaming fluid from your stomach, pancreas, and liver—should wash your whole small intestine clean so that no bacteria can thrive in it.

**Caller 3:** Is there a good quality nutrition-based textbook you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not that I know of. Years ago, I saw some really good monographs on particular topics, like how the intestine works, but I don't know of one that has put everything together.

**Caller 3:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** If you want to email me at `andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com`, we've produced a comprehensive breakdown of things Dr. Peat advocates and doesn't advocate.
