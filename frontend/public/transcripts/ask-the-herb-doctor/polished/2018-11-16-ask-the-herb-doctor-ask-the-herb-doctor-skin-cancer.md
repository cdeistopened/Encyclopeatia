# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Skin Cancer, Vitamin D, and Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. This month we are discussing skin cancers, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies. We have Dr. Raymond Peat with us this evening. He has been joining us for nearly ten years, and we are always pleased to have his wisdom because he comes from an era before financial interests steamrolled the way things are understood now. Dr. Peat, for those who have never heard you, would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I graduated from Southern Oregon College in 1956 with a Bachelor's degree majoring in humanities. I went to the University of Oregon for a master's degree and taught linguistics and other subjects for several years. Then, in 1968, I went back to the University of Oregon in biology for a Ph.D., which I received in 1972.

**Andrew Murray:** You have been working ever since, doing your own independent research. You often cite authors and work that one wouldn't find much evidence of now unless digging deeply.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I actually started reading old medical textbooks in the 1940s. I found that there was more interesting stuff in the old books than they were teaching in college. That's why I studied humanities rather than sciences at first.

## Solar Radiation, Vitamin D, and Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** There is an ongoing debate between pro-UV exposure groups and the anti-UV camps. On one hand, solar UV radiation represents a significant environmental risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer. On the other hand, 90% of all vitamin D in the body is formed in the skin through the action of UV radiation. The dilemma is the undeniable association between vitamin D deficiency and a host of pathologies—ranging from colon, prostate, and breast cancer to bone diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular issues.

We know that UVB causes a rearrangement of DNA, producing photo products which are known mutagens. UVA causes damage via oxidative processes. You have mentioned previously that cholesterol is not a villain, but actually very important. Can you speak on the effect of skin cholesterol on the conversion of ultraviolet light to vitamin D, and the difference between a young person's skin and an aging person's skin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have known for several years that over the age of 60 or 70, it takes about twice as much sunlight exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D. It turns out that is simply because old skin has only about half as much cholesterol as young skin.

That age effect is not confined to the skin. It occurs in the adrenal glands, which are the largest producers of steroid hormones and cholesterol itself. The digestive system and liver are important sources of cholesterol, and the brain and skin produce most of the cholesterol they need. But in all those organs, the machinery for producing cholesterol declines roughly 50% by old age.

In the skin, it becomes obvious because vitamin D isn't produced in the sunlight. But cholesterol has many functions. The brain produces steroids from cholesterol, as do the gonads and adrenal glands. The skin can also produce steroid hormones from cholesterol. Any injury to the skin—even intense blue light or injecting irritating substances—will cause the skin to defensively increase the production of both cholesterol and the vitamin D derived from it, to the extent that it can according to its age and health.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this the mechanism where you've mentioned that polyunsaturates and lipid byproducts—lipofuscin in particular—cause oxidative damage to the endothelium, and the body produces cholesterol to repair that damage? So the cholesterol found in a blockage is actually an immediate response to that stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once the oxidative damage occurs, that damage is enough to rouse the system to produce vitamin D and cholesterol. However, the polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) has a direct action on the cholesterol enzyme HMG-CoA reductase; it inhibits production. Saturated fats don't inhibit cholesterol production. So if you are going to use any oil on the skin, it should be cocoa butter, cow butter, or anything highly saturated—not any of the PUFA seed oils.

**Andrew Murray:** So people using rejuvenating or anti-aging creams should definitely not use products based on polyunsaturates.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct. There were experiments about 30 or 40 years ago on rabbits. They shaved their backs so they were exposed to ultraviolet sunlight. The rabbits fed polyunsaturated fats developed quickly wrinkled, aged skin on their backs. The ones with the saturated diet didn't have that sun damage. The double bonds in polyunsaturated fats are especially reactive to ultraviolet light.

Even through indirect pathways, blue light can activate the lipid peroxidation process. For example, vitamin B2 (the yellow vitamin) absorbs blue light and becomes chemically reactive. Either ultraviolet or blue light can create a vitamin deficiency, impairing the ability of the cell to produce energy oxidatively. That leads to the production of lactic acid, which creates inflammation. Even blue light can lead to a fatigued process of the cell, leading to inflammation and degeneration.

**Andrew Murray:** And this is why you advocate eliminating polyunsaturates from your diet and switching to saturated sources. It is coming to be recognized that stearic acid, a purely saturated fatty acid, has anti-cancer effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Just to recap: an elderly person has 50% less cholesterol in their skin and needs twice the sunlight exposure to create the same amount of vitamin D. Being indoors in a nursing home further compounds their susceptibility to cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of years ago, there were experiments on hairless mice. They exposed them to ultraviolet light and then gave them topical vitamin D. The topical vitamin D prevented the UV carcinogenesis by treating them *after* the exposure.

## Statins and the Mevalonate Pathway

**Andrew Murray:** I looked at the mevalonate pathway while doing background reading. The production of cholesterol, steroids, carotenoids, saponins, and limonoids are blocked by statins at a particular point in this pathway. If you are over 50, you want a cholesterol level of around 200 to 220; it is protective. Using statins to lower cholesterol leads to a deficit in all those other steroids and products for which cholesterol is a building block.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is gradually being realized that ubiquinone, or Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), is a product of that same enzyme statins inhibit. CoQ10 is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory system. When a tissue is stressed, such as a muscle during exercise, the mitochondria fail to produce enough energy, leading to muscle breakdown. Sometimes that muscle breakdown plugs up the kidneys and kills the person. But very commonly, it causes muscle pain made worse by exercise. That is due to damage to the mitochondrial respiratory system. Since the brain and other organs use the same CoQ10 and mitochondrial processes, the muscle damage is just a very noticeable symptom, whereas the cognitive damage is less noticeable.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned lactic acid being a byproduct and very inflammatory. Is that apart from this CoQ10 decrease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a necessary adaptation to anything that impairs oxidation.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you see any of the other steroid hormones or components like terpenes and terpenoids being affected?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect even body odor will be affected by it. It is known that some of these perfumey chemicals made by that pathway are involved in the fragrance of a young person's skin oils. I imagine statins would tend to make a person lose that fragrance.

## Body Odor, Stress, and Health

**Andrew Murray:** What do you see as a direct link regarding body odor? Some people have no smell, and others smell bad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alexander the Great, who apparently had great vitality, was famous for how sweet he smelled. Historians wrote that people would collect his used garments because they had a permanent perfume infused into them. Everyone under stress can emit different chemicals. For example, isoprene tends to show up during nighttime stress.

**Andrew Murray:** How else do you see body odor, apart from bacterial breakdown?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a healthy person, the skin is under the influence of thyroid hormone and feedback from progesterone (which is produced in the skin from cholesterol). Insulin and thyroid hormone are very important for keeping the flow going from energy through cholesterol into the steroids. Those steroids include the pheromones and sex-attracting steroids. Some of the testosterone-related minor androgens create a perfume that is very closely associated with high production of steroids.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there any link to liver dysfunction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When the liver is failing, the fats that should be broken down and excreted can come out in the breath. Acutely, they show up in the breath—for example, when you get hungry. If your liver isn't efficient, things in your tissues will come out in your exhaled breath. Chronically, they accumulate and come out more gradually in the skin oils.

**Andrew Murray:** We call this "death breath," and you find it on children too. Our five-year-old, if we haven't made sure she gets plenty of sugars during the day, will wake up with this smell. It doesn't happen when she has a sugary snack in the evening.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That smell can precede an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache—anything where the blood sugar is inadequate and the stress hormones break down tissues.

## Caller: Monk Fruit and Diabetes

**Caller (Chris):** I've done research on Monk Fruit sugar (Luo Han Guo). In China, they use it for controlling diabetes. If administered regularly, it supposedly reduces inflammation and oxidation. What do you say about Monk Fruit sugar compared to regular table sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I actually think *any* sugar, but especially fruit sugar, is a good treatment for diabetes. Glucose is a promoter of stem cell renewal in the pancreas and tends to suppress the free fatty acids which are produced under stress. Free fatty acids are constantly killing the beta cells in the pancreas. Every time they regenerate under the influence of glucose, if there isn't enough glucose to suppress the free fatty acids, the regenerated beta cells get killed again. Keeping the fatty acids down is the essence of curing diabetes.

**Andrew Murray:** Engineer, you mentioned a chemical in Monk Fruit?

**Engineer:** Yes, it contains about 35% fructose and sucrose, but there is a triterpene glycoside that gives it the sweetness.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, have you seen comparisons of Monk Fruit specifically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't seen any comparisons of it in diabetes.

## Caller: Skin Rash, Vitamin D, and Thyroid

**Caller (New York):** I had a skin rash and avoided cortisol creams, using salt and baking soda baths instead, which helped. It is coming back now. My Vitamin D level was 39, which is low. I'm over 60. How can I get my Vitamin D up if sun doesn't seem to work? Also, regarding cortisol: if adrenal glands are less efficient with age, wouldn't taking adrenal hormones help rejuvenate them so I can make my own cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you tried supplements like DHEA, progesterone, or pregnenolone?

**Caller (New York):** I took pregnenolone and felt great, but I wasn't sure how it affects other hormones. I also take CoQ10 because I run. I take 30mg of natural desiccated thyroid. My temperature is in the low 97s in the morning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is essential for making all of these steroids. In a young, healthy person under stress, a lot of cortisol is produced. That will also increase cholesterol, pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone to back up the cortisol. With age, there is a constant decrease in the ratio of DHEA and protective steroids in relation to cortisol. Even though your average cortisol might stay the same with aging, it becomes constantly more active. You are more susceptible to side effects from cortisol because your DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone are going down, along with the decreasing cholesterol in all tissues.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding Vitamin D, absorption is variable. Some people need 2,000 to 4,000 IU, others 10,000 IU. Using a supplement is one of the best ways to get it if you aren't producing enough from sunlight. Aiming for the 50 nanogram per milliliter range is a good strategy.

## Caller: Skin Bacteria and UV Light

**Caller (Mike):** What are your thoughts on skin bacteria, specifically *Corynebacterium*? Is UV a good treatment for killing bacteria in the skin, like with acne?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think thyroid and vitamin D are major factors in immunity. There is another cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is very similar in function to 25-hydroxyvitamin D. They both activate the immune system. I think they work right along with vitamin A and thyroid hormone in keeping skin bacteria under control.

## Topical Treatments for Skin Lesions

**Andrew Murray:** Would topical application of vitamin D with a saturated fat, like coconut oil, be a reasonable approach to improving vitamin D status in the skin and addressing lesions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think vitamin D and cholesterol—especially with saturated fats to compete against whatever polyunsaturated fats happen to be in the skin—have a good chance of overcoming the pre-cancerous condition.

In a typical cancer, there will be a fully cancerized zone surrounded by lower degrees of conversion of the cells. It is as if something is being emitted from a center, causing gradual progressive change in the surrounding tissue. It isn't that cells are traveling out; it's that the surrounding normal cells are gradually being injured. Part of that is that normal metabolites are being suppressed by toxins, such as lactic acid emitted by the cancer cells.

Things applied topically in the vicinity are going to keep those pre-cancerous cells from going the rest of the way. About 20 years ago, researchers found that almost everyone with outside light exposure had mutated, pre-cancerous cells in their facial skin. But when they covered the skin for just a few weeks, that same area was entirely free of the mutant cells. This shows the body is able to kill off the bad cells and replace them with fresh, non-cancerous cells if given the chance to rest from the damage.

**Andrew Murray:** So stopping the injury allows it to return to normal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Autopsies on middle-aged people killed in accidents found that everyone by the age of 50 has cancer somewhere in their body. Yet most people don't die of cancer. The goal is to stop making cancers. I think that is the function of applying things such as progesterone, vitamin D, cholesterol, and maybe mevalonic acid.

## Caller: Skin Cancer History and DHEA

**Caller (Chris from Humboldt):** I'm 51, grew up in Southern California getting baked on the beach. I've had severe sunburns and have fought skin cancer recently—actinic keratosis and spots they keep cutting off. I'm worried if they keep cutting, I won't have any skin left.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Your description reminds me of a man in Southern California who had cancer on his ear. The doctor said he had to cut off the ear to cure the cancer. He didn't want that, so he put a mixture of progesterone and DHEA on it. A week or two later, the cancer fell off.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to add a caveat: when using DHEA, ensure your thyroid is working well. Otherwise, you run the risk of converting DHEA into estrogen, which is a pro-cancerous compound.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes skin cancers heal up just from increasing the thyroid, because the thyroid increases the production of cholesterol and the immune steroids.

**Caller (Chris from Humboldt):** Is DHEA and progesterone something I can just go buy?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes, they are both non-prescription dietary supplements.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes was the person who showed how effective the temperature check could be for diagnosing hypothyroidism. His books are very important to read.

## Caller: Vitamin E and Royal Jelly

**Caller (Long Island):** You didn't mention Vitamin E. Are tocotrienols preferable? Also, thoughts on royal jelly versus bee pollen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is information that tocotrienols in large doses cause liver enlargement in experimental animals, which suggests they are treated as a toxin. I've been suspicious that they are overemphasizing their value for marketing reasons compared to traditional vitamin E. One problem with vitamin E is that it can preserve the amount of PUFA in the tissue. It is important to keep your polyunsaturated fats down as well as using vitamin E to block their effects.

**Andrew Murray:** And royal jelly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is extremely rich in nutrients. If there was a lot of it, everyone should probably eat some, but you don't want to steal the bees' food.

## Caller: Cannabis Oil vs. Olive Oil

**Caller (Redway):** My 97-year-old grandmother was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma on her nose. The doctors wanted to cut her nose off. We applied cannabis oil—basically hashish mixed with olive oil—and found efficacy within two weeks. I know it sounds anecdotal, but do you have thoughts on cannabis oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the olive oil is more therapeutic than the cannabis oil.

**Caller (Redway):** I heard someone say that too.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aloe leaf is another thing people have used successfully on skin cancers. But regarding the oil: oleic acid, which is the major fat in olive oil, increases the synthesis of cholesterol.

**Caller (Redway):** Wow, who knew? Thanks for the show.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat, for your time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.
