## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. Every third Friday of the month from 7:00 to 8:00 PM, I do a health-related topic, and we are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us. He has been a long-term guest of the show.

For the past 10 years, we've been blessed to have Dr. Ray Peat on this show to give his scientific perspective on what we are told is good for us medically. From his research, we've sought to educate and light the way for others, to show the many misleading claims drug manufacturers make, and to expose the truth concerning many prevalent drugs prescribed without full knowledge of the science—which clearly shows harm in using them.

Last month we covered the harmful effects of serotonin and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are commonly prescribed using the false justification that they are beneficial for mood, depression, and anxiety. Prior to that, we discussed the ongoing war on words concerning estrogen and progesterone, with a huge amount of data showing estrogen's pro-carcinogenic activity whilst demonstrating progesterone's protective anti-cancer benefits.

This month, I wanted to cover the misleading, dangerous, and widespread collusion and cover-ups surrounding nitric oxide propaganda in endothelial health, the heart attack risks associated with the infamous drug Viagra, how cholesterol is so important in the maintenance of good health, and how the use of statins is dangerous.

Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for giving your time again. As usual, please tell people about your background, where you came from, and what you spent your last four decades doing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 50s, I was mostly studying humanities. In the 60s, I got involved in experimental education, and then from 1968 to 1972, I did graduate school in biology for a PhD in physiology.

**Andrew Murray:** You've spent the last 30 or 40 years gaining information and finding out that what you were taught, or what your professors wanted you to believe, was inaccurate and not scientifically valid. When you looked at actual scientific research, you found conflicting information about tenets that were held as the truth at the time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over the years, I spent a lot of time in the university science library. In all those years, there were only two professors that I saw repeatedly in the library looking things up, out of several dozen.

**Andrew Murray:** Because you were there a lot.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was there a lot, and they weren't. It was rare to see.

## The Industry of Medical Science

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to discuss the commonly prescribed drugs that people are familiar with and how there isn't good information supporting their use. You've mentioned the political weight behind FDA approvals, the financial lobbying from drug companies, and the indoctrination within medical teaching establishments to reinforce an ideology that supports drug manufacturing profits.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The industry has promoted the idea that the only valid science to support a medical approach is the randomized blinded study in humans. But that requires a huge amount of financing. Normally, only the drug companies want to put that much money into that sort of thing. The typical scientist looking for things to explain how the organism works does their experiments on animals at a moderate expense—maybe several thousand dollars rather than dozens of millions.

The drug companies say that animal research isn't valid for basing medical decisions, except when they don't have any valid human information. The drug companies will base everything on animal studies when it suits them. For example, with estrogen, they first tested it on dogs and found it killed them in various ways. So they shifted to rats. The whole science of preventing osteoporosis by using estrogen is based on rats because they gave the "right" kind of result, whereas dogs gave the opposite result. By selecting their animal experiments, they can gather information to support selling their product. But if it's anything critical of their product, then it can't be accepted; it has to be these huge double-blinded controlled human trials.

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of getting objective results, people are probably the only truly accurate representation of a drug's safety and efficacy. But as you've pointed out, when you look at the papers written to supply the evidence base, there are often glaring mistakes in the setup or the inference.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In my recent newsletter on cholesterol, I mentioned that for decades it's been known that if you lower cholesterol, you create depression, suicidal tendency, cognitive impairment, and all kinds of physical ailments that are demonstrably damaging cell structure. But just a couple of months ago, a new trial was started to supposedly treat atherosclerosis and heart disease by removing cholesterol from the arteries using exactly the chemical—cyclodextrins—that for decades has been shown to damage the organism by removing cholesterol.

One trial years ago found that a short exposure to cyclodextrin removed cholesterol from the fibers of the hearing apparatus and the cochlear hair cells, causing deafness. Animal studies made it clear that these things are very dangerous, damaging brain cells, muscle cells, and the hearing apparatus. But the trial is going ahead on the crazy idea that taking cholesterol out of the blood vessels is going to improve health.

About 30 or 40 years ago, I talked to a person who is now a well-known physiology professor. At that time, he was proposing to inject very fine powdered ground glass intravenously to grind out the cholesterol from the atheroma. That really probably isn't as harmful as this current human trial using the cyclodextrins.

## Cholesterol and Cell Flexibility

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned before that cholesterol introduces fluidity and flexibility into a molecule, and that when cells become rigid, they rupture. Low cholesterol has been positively correlated with dementia and neurodegenerative effects. What do you say about the flexibility conferred to cells by adequate cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The best-known model of that kind of flexibility is the red blood cell, which has to fold up to go through the capillaries, which are narrower than the diameter of the cell. If they are stiffened by the removal of cholesterol, they won't go through the capillaries. When put under pressure, they tend to disintegrate because of the brittleness. That same stiffness has been identified in essentially every type of cell; it just happens the red blood cell is convenient to look at.

That lubricating quality of cholesterol is something where the foundation goes back 90 or 100 years to the work of Bungenberg de Jong, a Dutch chemist who studied emulsions. He called the complex emulsion a "coacervate," meaning a clustering together of different phases of different types of molecules. For example, a starch and a protein mix and find stability containing different proportions of the two polymers and water. You get several phases with just those three substances. Each phase has its way of relating to small molecules, segregating ions like sodium and potassium, sugar, and urea in very complex ways.

Gilbert Ling, for example, was working directly out of Bungenberg de Jong's basic research on the physics of solutions. The cholesterol has a lubricating, limbering effect on these coacervate complex mixtures of polymers.

The people who ignore that physical basis of biology talk about cholesterol as existing in cell membranes. Some say 97% of the cholesterol in a cell is in the cytoplasmic membrane, but that ignores 97% of its real functions, which are to control the entire physiology of the cell. Every protein in the cell is associated in particular ways with cholesterol. The cytoskeleton, the structure that creates cell division, the matrix that regulates and holds the DNA—all of this involves the intimate lubricating or relaxing effect of cholesterol on these large polymer molecules.

**Andrew Murray:** Time and time again, it is shown that cholesterol is so important and actually a positive indicator of longevity. Over the age of 50, you're actually better off in long-term studies with cholesterol around 250, even though 200 is the cutoff point they use.

## Nitric Oxide vs. Nitrous Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** I want to ask you about nitrous oxide and nitric oxide. Around here, we see little gas canisters on the side of the road—nitrous oxide used as a propellant for whipped cream, or "whippets." It's also used in dental practices as "laughing gas." It's not the same as nitric oxide, though they are similar nitrogen-containing compounds. Do you know anything about nitrous oxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can be metabolized into the others. The immediate effect isn't as harmful as nitric oxide, but since the body can metabolize it into nitrite, nitrate, and nitric oxide, you don't want to expose yourself to it very many times.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about nitric oxide. I know you've done several newsletters on it. I wanted to ask about Viagra, which is based on nitric oxide, and how drug companies turned this basic poison into a medical product. The people who discovered nitric oxide got the 1998 Nobel Prize for it, purporting it to be beneficial for killing infections and treating atherosclerosis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early part of the 20th century, several gases were known and studied for their toxic effects: cyanide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and nitric oxide. They were found to kill cells or impair energy production by blocking respiration. These have over the years been found to be produced inside the body. Some people say that if the body produces them, they must be beneficial. But until about 1980, nitric oxide was mostly known as the toxic component of smog.

As it came to be studied through the 80s, several people showed that this toxic effect contributes to diseases such as diabetes by knocking out oxidative energy production. But in the late 80s, someone noticed that estrogen acts by way of increasing nitric oxide. For example, when the uterus is exposed to either estrogen or nitric oxide, it swells up, takes on water, and goes through an oxygen-resisting type of metabolism.

The estrogen industry created a great myth about the benefit of estrogen. The nitric oxide people attached themselves to the estrogen-nitric oxide interactions. Then Viagra came on the market, shown to intensify the effects of endogenous nitric oxide. That, combined with the estrogen myth, created a great surge of positive thinking about nitric oxide and suppressed 10 years of research showing that it contributed to brain damage, heart damage, and vascular damage.

For example, women with pulmonary arterial hypertension impairing their circulation were told, "Nitric oxide opens blood vessels, let's have them breathe nitric oxide." But one of the functions of interfering with oxidative metabolism is that it causes cells to turn on collagen production. Breathing nitric oxide creates fibrosis of the lungs. I've known older women who were given Viagra because of that mystique of nitric oxide in the lungs.

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned before that there is a conjoining of estrogen, nitric oxide, and increased DNA methylation which is heritable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It shuts down your energy-producing systems, and that shuts down your expensive organs and tissues such as the brain. You can turn off the best functions of the organism not only in the individual but pass it on to the next generations.

**Andrew Murray:** You said that nitric oxide also shuts down the beneficial oxidative metabolism of glucose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the heart, when the parasympathetic system is activated to an extreme in shock, it slows down the heart. The parasympathetic acetylcholine stimulation activates nitric oxide production, and that reduces the heart's ability to use oxygen. It creates a hibernation state.

In the heart, the stress and shock reaction can shut down energy production. Within limits, it has a benefit because if you can't use oxygen, you don't suffer in the same way from oxygen deprivation. But the function of the heart is restricted. The heart becomes unable to relax. Relaxation is a high-energy function. If you turn off energy availability, contractile cells such as the heart won't be able to relax. That will raise the diastolic pressure. Usually, the whole circulatory system fails to relax in between beats. Having not relaxed fully, it can't beat fully. So it creates a progressive tendency toward heart failure.

**Andrew Murray:** That's an interesting concept, that relaxation is dependent on energy. We tend to think relaxation is a passive event.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hypoglycemia or suffocation will lead to constriction of blood vessels and even seizures. The brain goes through a total activation when it's deprived of either or both glucose and oxygen.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding nitrates and nitrites in preserved meats—these are byproducts of nitric oxide oxidation. They have been linked to cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1970, they were definitely identified as carcinogen formers in the stomach. Now that nitric oxide has been promoted, the nitrates have apparently lost their carcinogenicity.

**Andrew Murray:** And there is a causal link to Alzheimer's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starting at about the age of 40, nitric oxide synthesis increases generally, even in healthy people, but it is intensified in the demented brain.

## Caller Questions

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller.

**Caller (Michael):** My name is Michael, I'm from Redway. What is amyl nitrate?

**Andrew Murray:** It was "poppers." I think athletes used to do them. How does that fit into all of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically the legend was that for a while they thought it was the cause of AIDS. I think it's still considered to be an immune-destructive chemical. An interesting thing I saw recently was that nitric oxide stops hair follicle renewal. If people start thinking about baldness, they might be more interested in investigating the dangers of nitric oxide than just heart disease or dementia.

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller.

**Caller (Mike):** Mike from Connecticut. I wanted to find out what causes the faces and necks of aging men to turn red more so than women, and are there any tips to avoid that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's related to the hot flush that women get at menopause, which is clearly a surge of nitric oxide. But in men, there are other things, including an actual deficiency of riboflavin (Vitamin B2). I think that for some reason, as a consequence of nitric oxide poisoning, riboflavin is essential for respiratory energy production. The rosacea cheeks and red shiny nose—Vitamin B2 is usually a factor in that. I've seen almost instantaneous relief when someone got a big dose of Vitamin B2, but it doesn't last long. Once you've got a deficiency, the tissue doesn't retain the B2 effectively. It seems to be a chronic problem of getting the diet converted so you are taking in a little more than the normal amount of Vitamin B2 every day.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next call.

**Caller (Mendocino):** I'm calling from the Mendocino coast. Cardiologists will frequently tell their clients taking statins to take CoQ10 for fatigue. I was wondering how that helps. Also, they have them carry around nitroglycerin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The statins are poisoning the enzyme that makes cholesterol. That system makes several substances other than cholesterol, including CoQ10. It is now widely recognized that you're poisoning the whole respiratory system. CoQ10 is one of the other essential factors for oxidative metabolism. When that's deficient, the failure of energy can reach the point where muscle cells lack functioning mitochondria.

About 7% of statin users have some muscle pain. If you exercise while under the influence of the statin, you greatly increase the risk of killing the muscle cells because energy production can't keep up with energy expenditure. If the muscle breakdown is complete, the flow of debris from the disintegrating muscle can destroy your kidneys. Giving a good dose of CoQ10 is very protective. It isn't just protecting the muscles; the statin is doing exactly the same thing to the brain mitochondria and heart mitochondria.

**Caller (Mendocino):** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about nitroglycerin for relief of angina?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has similar side effects. I think it should be limited to relieve the symptoms, but work on correcting the problem with such things as CoQ10 and normalizing oxidative metabolism.

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller.

**Caller (New York):** I'm from New York. On the CoQ10, what is a "good dose"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think anyone really knows how to schedule the dosing. Just by effect—if you feel your muscles and nerves are functioning properly and you don't get any muscle soreness or swelling, then the dose is probably enough.

**Caller (New York):** My next question: As you get older, hydrochloric acid (HCL) in the stomach declines. I started taking a smaller dose of Betaine HCL, like 150-200mg, with the glycine/gelatin you recommend to avoid irritation. It seems to have improved my digestion. Is that possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. Even strong vinegar or acetic acid helps the enzymes to function. The betaine hydrochloride definitely acidifies the stomach and works. But one long-range concern is that betaine feeds into the methyl metabolism. You want to look at the long-range effects of increasing methylation. Currently, it's stylish to supplement methyl groups, but if you decrease the methionine and cysteine in the diet of animals, their lifespan increases 30 or 40% just by the absence of those methyl donors. I would suspect that chronic use of betaine is going to be like increased consumption of methionine and cysteine.

**Caller (New York):** If I take it with gelatin, which doesn't have those methyl donors, does that balance it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's still possible that will balance it.

**Caller (New York):** Second question: If someone wakes up in the middle of the night with high cortisol, what is a good way to get the body back into repair? Red light, food, or a CO2 bath?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nitric oxide has the same curve, rising to a peak around 7:00 AM along with cortisol. Penetrating red light helps to free the respiratory apparatus from both carbon monoxide and nitric oxide. That is a way of protecting yourself from darkness. But sugar and thyroid function, producing carbon dioxide... Carbon dioxide is the basic stabilizer against stress.

**Caller (New York):** What about a dry CO2 bath? Like sitting in a bag of CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you have a big plastic box full of CO2 by your bed, you can just get out of bed and sit in your box of CO2 and absorb that for 20 or 30 minutes without eating. Even in Japan, they're treating cancer with transdermal carbon dioxide.

## ADHD and Medical Corruption

**Andrew Murray:** In the last few minutes, I wanted to mention the ADD and ADHD drugs. This is now treated as a disease for which amphetamines are prescribed to young children.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things that impair the oxygen metabolism of your brain do create attention deficit. Some studies found that coffee improved focus and attention not only in those with the diagnosis but even honors students. But it happens that as far back as the late 1960s, people were noticing a connection between amphetamines and lymphoma. I was aware of that because I had a close friend who loved his Benzedrine and died in his 40s from lymphoma. Lately, more people are recognizing that lymphoma is the result of toxic stress.

**Andrew Murray:** Ritalin is another one of those drugs. It's another unfortunate example of how these things are weaponized against us for massive profit.

I want to close the show with two quotes from the editors of the most prestigious medical journals in the world.

Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of *The Lancet*, said in 2015: "The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue."

Dr. Marcia Angell, former Editor-in-Chief of the *New England Journal of Medicine*, wrote in 2009: "It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor."

And Dr. Relman, another former Editor-in-Chief of the *New England Journal of Medicine*, said in 2002: "The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it's disgraceful."
