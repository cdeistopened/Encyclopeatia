## Introduction: You Are What You Eat

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. I’m Andrew Murray. For those of you who have never listened to the show, I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and graduated with a degree in Herbal Medicine. I run a clinic in Garberville where I consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

This month's subject is "You Are What You Eat." This phrase has come to us via quite a tortuous route. Anthelme Brillat-Savarin wrote in *Physiologie du Goût* in 1826, "Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are." In an essay titled *Concerning Spiritualism and Materialism* (1863), Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach wrote, "Man is what he eats." Neither Brillat-Savarin nor Feuerbach meant their quotations to be taken literally; they were stating that the food one eats has a bearing on one's state of mind and health.

The actual phrase didn't emerge in English until sometime later. In the 1920s and 30s, the nutritionist Victor Lindlahr, who was a strong believer in the idea that food controls health, developed the "catabolic diet." Research now suggests that depression and dementia are affected by the quality of our diets across the life course. Indeed, studies from countries as diverse as Norway, Spain, Japan, China, the UK, the US, and Australia show people whose diets are healthier are less likely to experience depression. The most recent evidence points to the importance of the mother's diet for the mental and physical health of their children.

We are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat to hear his perspective on this subject. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. For those who may not have heard you, I would appreciate it if you would give an outline of your academic and professional background.

## Metabolic Efficiency and Aging

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After I had studied in the humanities and taught art and English, I decided to go back to graduate school in Biology in 1968 at the University of Oregon. I wrote my dissertation on the age-related changes in oxidative metabolism in the hamster uterus and how it affects fertility with aging. That involved hormones and nutrition, and how the environment affects those factors, especially the efficiency of metabolism using oxygen. Since then, I've been writing, doing consultations, and trying to figure things out, still working on some of those same themes: oxidative metabolism and aging.

The whole idea of metabolic efficiency is one of my current themes. Lindlahr, whom you just mentioned, had the idea of the catabolic diet: to choose foods for their metabolic *inefficiency*. People eating to satisfy their appetite tend to get fat on the available foods. He found that he could get people to lose fat very consistently and quickly by choosing certain foods that increased their metabolic rate so that they could burn calories faster than they were eating them.

That was in the 1920s. Just by chance, a few years later, George Burr, who was studying the effect of fats in the diet, found that if he made his rats deficient in unsaturated fatty acids, they burned calories at a terrific rate—as much as 50% faster than normal. He thought that was bad. However, he became very popular with the agricultural industry because they found that feeding those polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) to pigs and chickens caused them to gain weight quickly and cheaply without eating very much food. This was just the opposite of what Lindlahr wanted to do, which was to find foods that would decrease the efficiency of the metabolism so that people would produce heat without gaining weight.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know what kind of foods Lindlahr advocated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of fruits and vegetables, including fruit juices. Standard nutritional education emphasizes the concept of specific dynamic action, or the thermogenic effect of various foods. It's widely recognized that eating protein increases your body temperature and heat production by quite a bit—15% or 20%. Sugar a little less than that.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you've mentioned coconut oil quite a lot in the past as being thermogenic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think there are many reasons for that. Coconut is a very highly saturated fat. It happens that the unsaturated fats interfere with the mitochondrial use of oxygen in several ways: by producing free radicals, inflammation, and by interfering with thyroid hormone function. So, all along the line, the polyunsaturated fats slow down oxidative metabolism. If your body is soaked in these conventional seed oils, then when you eat coconut oil—especially the shorter, very mobile fatty acids that are only a third or half as long as the standard fats—these move into cells very quickly and oxidize without that anti-thyroid effect that the seed oils mostly have.

## Dieting, Cortisol, and Muscle Loss

**Andrew Murray:** So Victor Lindlahr came up with the catabolic diet. Anabolism is to build muscle, and catabolism is to break it down with the production of heat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and 60s, people were experimenting with what kind of diet is efficient for losing fat while maintaining health. They did experiments in which people would have just pure water for 10 or 14 days. They analyzed what happened to their bodies and found that they lost almost pure protein during that time, and very little fat. However, if they ate maybe 600 to 800 calories per day during that same period, they would lose mostly fat and very little protein.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting. That protein loss is the muscle mass a person loses when they fast.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's why so many women are dieting constantly and getting fatter. If they eat an extremely low-calorie diet, creating stress, the high cortisol and other stress hormones cause them to break down their protein. Their big muscles shrink. A typical dieter will have calf muscles that become atrophied. The big skeletal muscles, even at rest, burn fat to maintain themselves. So, the more dieting they do, the smaller their muscles get, and the easier it is to get fat the next time they eat a normal diet.

**Andrew Murray:** You said with the addition of some food, protein was conserved. How much fat was in that diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They fed them a mixed diet—a little protein, a little carbohydrate—not especially a low-fat intake, but enough to get some calorie needs from the diet rather than from their tissues.

When you are in the first day of a fast, your body uses up the sugar stored as glycogen. As soon as your blood sugar falls because you've used up your stores, your cortisol rises. First adrenaline, then cortisol. The cortisol, having no food available, starts converting your thymus gland and big skeletal muscles into free amino acids. Some of these are converted to glucose to feed your blood cells, brain, and eyes, because those have an absolute requirement for glucose. Even a plain sugar diet to supply that minimal amount that your brain and blood cells require will greatly prevent the rise in cortisol and loss of good tissue.

## The Microbiome and Natural Antibiotics

**Andrew Murray:** I want to jump onto the subject of the microbiome. It is well established that your gut is your "second brain." There are quite a few journal articles linking disease processes to the microbiome. I know you advocate several dietary factors that modulate the microbiome, such as indigestible fibers like bamboo shoots and carrots. You also talk about cascara, not just for bowel motility, but because it has a structure similar to tetracycline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's interesting that both emodin (from cascara or Chinese rhubarb) and tetracycline (and related minocycline and doxycycline) are anti-inflammatory as well as antiseptic. They have a surprising range of good effects. Minocycline is being found to prevent or possibly improve dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Emodin seems to have new functions found every year, including improving the flora of the intestine.

**Andrew Murray:** Am I right in thinking that emodin is also present in aloe vera?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, lots of plants. Generally, they are laxative plants. But it isn't the typical purging kind of laxative. If the cascara isn't properly aged, it does have an irritating, purging effect. But aging makes it insoluble in water comparatively; it loses the irritating inflammatory property and becomes anti-inflammatory and sedative. It actually increases the production of energy while having a nerve-calming effect.

**Andrew Murray:** This is that red compound you've mentioned that is energetically favorable in terms of electron quenching and anti-inflammatory activity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As a sideline to my research in graduate school on what causes oxidative metabolism to go down with aging, I would look for all kinds of plants and animals that were colored, do extracts, and look for things that stimulated oxidative metabolism. I got the interest partly from Albert Szent-Györgyi. He found that the color of cells is closely connected to the oxidative process—for example, the deep maroon or purple color of the liver. He knew that semiconductors are generally black because of a peculiar electronic arrangement that causes them to absorb all the light that hits them. He figured that the life process involves semiconduction, so pigments are especially relevant to the use of energy in living things.

**Andrew Murray:** Like methylene blue, which we discussed last month as an artificial electron transporter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Like vitamin C. Vitamin C in its normal form isn't a pigment, but it has some of the same electronic behaviors. Both of those can pick up electrons from nutrients such as glucose and pass them into the mitochondrion. Even if the first two units of the mitochondrion are damaged, methylene blue and vitamin C—and probably many other natural pigments—can deliver energy electrons down to the third complex of the mitochondrion and allow it to keep functioning. Part of that function is to stop producing free radicals.

## Gut Bacteria and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** What are your thoughts about altering the microbiome so that specific bacteria known to be detrimental can be eradicated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 1990, I read an article from a fertility clinic where women were trying to conceive, but the fertilized ovum wouldn't implant. The doctors thought it might indicate an infection in the uterus, so they gave all their patients a course of antibiotics. Besides improving their fertility, a lot of the patients said their chronic headaches had disappeared. They gave them hormone tests and found that the antibiotics had lowered their cortisol and estrogen production and increased progesterone.

Following that, I suggested that since estrogen is excreted by a healthy liver into the bile, much of it is reabsorbed if you have a sluggish intestine. I suggested that if they eat a carrot every day to stimulate the intestine, the fiber will bind the bile and lower the serum estrogen level. It is now generally accepted that any fiber tends to lower your absorption of estrogen from bile. Within three or four days, these people tested their estrogen, cortisol, and progesterone, and the carrot was doing the same thing the synthetic antibiotics had done.

Knowing that carrots can get tiresome if you eat one every day for years, I looked around for other foods that were antiseptic. Bamboo shoots are something you don't get too tired of; they don't have much flavor, so you can put them in different foods. Cooking a bamboo shoot doesn't destroy the fiber the way a cooked carrot does. You have to eat raw carrots or cooked bamboo shoots.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know of any other fibers that have that effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mushrooms, I think. Because they grow underground in a very decaying environment, they have to have powerful antibiotics. They have high-value protein, and the protein happens to be pretty low in methionine, which is the most toxic of the amino acids. Methionine slows your metabolism. So with mushrooms, you're getting metabolic stimulants, lowering estrogen, and disinfecting your intestine.

## Caller: High Blood Pressure and Thyroid

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our first caller. You’re on the air.

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** I have a question. Last month I developed very high blood pressure that spikes. I don't have a family history of it. About two months ago, I had my T3 medicine increased, and I got heart palpitations. I titrated down off of that over six weeks, but I still had palpitations until I started magnesium after hearing your show.

However, in October, I went on a "silly little thing" where I was trying to increase my body temperature by eating more sugar and salt. I increased my salt quite a bit—maybe 3,000 or 4,000 milligrams. My blood pressure skyrocketed. Could coming down off the thyroid and that high salt diet have contributed to this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Was your TSH measured as part of the thyroid exam?

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** When I first was on T4, it was like 3, but then it went down to below zero—like 0.3. It's way low.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** TSH causes a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism. If T3 causes your T4 to go down too low, your TSH might come up. TSH does a lot of things that go with hypothyroidism, including high blood pressure. It makes your red cells more rigid, your blood and serum more viscous, and it tightens up small blood vessels. Everything it does tends to create higher blood pressure. If your TSH is currently extremely low, then you probably should have your other hormones, such as adrenaline, checked.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you always advocate a TSH as close to zero as possible just because it's a fairly inflammatory chaperone molecule, don't you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** I think I got mixed up. If TSH gets pretty low, does T3 make it lower?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you had lowered your TSH by taking fairly large amounts of T4...

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** It was 25 micrograms. It got really low. Then they incorporated T3 at 25, then increased it to 50. Then I started having heart palpitations. I titrated down, went to the doctor, and they said my thyroid is fine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Were other things like albumin and blood sugar okay? It's good to have albumin well above 4.0, blood glucose anywhere from 70 to 110, and potassium and sodium around the middle of the scale. Is there anything that might be irritating your digestive system? Sometimes that can cause stress and increased pressure.

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** No. I take Great Lakes gelatin, mix it in cold orange juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't dissolve the gelatin thoroughly, sometimes that can cause gas and irritation by feeding bacteria in the intestine. Is your pulse rate about where it was?

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** It's always been around the 70s.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Magnesium and calcium are two nutrients that help to lower blood pressure, but potassium is probably the most powerful. Orange juice is a very good source of potassium. One other nutrient that can powerfully lower blood pressure is vitamin K. I know a doctor whose blood pressure had been 240 over 140, and within two or three weeks of using a lot of vitamin K, his pressure came down to 140 over 70.

**Andrew Murray:** What would be a reasonable daily trial of vitamin K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That doctor who got such extreme results was taking 40 or 50 milligrams per day.

**Caller (Eastern Oregon):** Okay, thank you. They put me on lisinopril plus a diuretic now.

**Andrew Murray:** It definitely sounds like something more than just your thyroid because of the rapid onset. It sounds like an alarm reaction or adrenaline producing that blood pressure. Thyroid hormone generally antagonizes that and brings blood pressure down.

## Caller: Coconut Oil, Starch, and Mushrooms

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller (David):** I've heard for years that coconut oil is an antibiotic and antifungal. I wanted to ask Dr. Peat if that is true and how it works. Also, I've heard you say that when you eat starch, it can get into the bloodstream and create problems in capillaries, and that saturated fat helps prevent that. How does saturated fat help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It slows digestion enough to keep things in an emulsion, giving enzymes time to start breaking down the starch particles. Gerhard Volkheimer, who did the persorption research, showed that starch without fat would immediately—in 15 or 20 minutes—show up in your bloodstream. With fat, it didn't show up, probably because it gives it time to break down.

But I think the most important effect of the fat is that germicidal action, suppressing the bacteria. If your digestion is working right, your whole small intestine should be sterile. In sluggish digestion or low thyroid, people often get bacteria growing all the way up close to their stomach. In that case, when you eat any starch, it feeds the bacteria. The bacteria produce endotoxin, which causes your intestine to produce nitric oxide, serotonin, and histamine. The nitric oxide is a very powerful poison of oxidative metabolism.

So, the combination of bacteria—especially in the small intestine—and any kind of starch that isn't quickly absorbed is going to feed the bacteria, increase nitric oxide, and basically poison your respiratory metabolism. Germ-free animals eat about 20% or 30% *more* calories than ordinary germ-bearing mice, but they are leaner and don't suffer from anxiety. This means the bacteria are producing something that poisons your metabolism.

**Caller (David):** Is coconut oil better for that action because of the short and medium chains compared to butter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Saturated fats are pretty good antifungals and antibacterials. The athlete's foot remedy that kills fungus efficiently is an 11-carbon saturated fat. The shorter they are, the faster they diffuse. Apparently, they are more active as a toxin or antiseptic if they're a little shorter than the stearic acid of butter.

**Caller (David):** I'm going to try a soup with bamboo sprouts and potato juice. I was going to add shiitake mushrooms. Do you think that's a decent soup?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so, but make sure you don't get toxic mushrooms.

**Andrew Murray:** I have to interject here. The only thing I am allergic to is shiitake mushrooms. I came out in a widespread body rash. It took about four weeks to resolve. It happened again years later, and a third time when I was handling shiitake mushroom powder. I find it a very allergenic product.

**Caller (David):** Dr. Peat has talked about Gerald Pollack and structured water. Pollack mentioned that walking barefoot and getting natural sunlight could possibly help structure the water in the body. He also said red wavelengths of light help structure the water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. The flow of electrons is the basic thing that structures water. When I talk about energy and structure, I'm thinking primarily of the fine layers of water adjoining proteins and fats in the cells. That is created and maintained by the flow of electrons, mostly from glucose to oxygen. When that flow is interrupted, the structure is lost. Just like if you stir a pot of spaghetti, all the strings line up; energy flow generates structure. A German researcher named Andrei Sommer has been doing interesting research showing exactly that—that red light itself organizes the structure of water.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you talk about red light a lot as a free radical quenching substance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And it desorbs nitric oxide from the cytochrome oxidase.

## Under-Eye Puffiness

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had a caller who left a question with the engineer. She is 64 years old and wondering about under-eye puffiness.

**Andrew Murray:** A 64-year-old lady sounds like low thyroid. Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, sometimes low thyroid or something missing in the diet can be a factor, but most often it's low thyroid. For example, if your thyroid is chronically low, your cholesterol is likely to be chronically above average as a compensation. Thyroid should turn cholesterol into the steroids: progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA. Those should regulate the water and the inside-outside balance of water in the cell.

## Caller: Sulfites in Wine

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller. You're on the air.

**Caller (North Coast):** What do you know about sulfites in wine regarding digestive problems?

**Andrew Murray:** Sulfite-free wine can be labeled as such, but others must state "contains sulfites." I know Dr. Peat has mentioned that sulfites are very allergenic and can cause symptoms from headache to respiratory disorders.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is potentially very pro-inflammatory and interferes with the handling of electrons. I think that's why it is so dangerously allergenic for so many people. I've had the experience of sulfited wines giving me vertigo and extreme symptoms for several days, which I think were from causing inflammation of the intestine.

**Caller (North Coast):** What about messing up the digestive system and causing pain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, red wines contain their own histamine, which can cause symptoms in a lot of people.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We will stop right there. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for spending your time with us again. Dr. Raymond Peat's website has a wealth of information and fully referenced scientific articles at [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com).

This is a couple of days until the winter solstice. I hope everyone pays attention to what they eat over Christmas. Hopefully no polyunsaturates. Hopefully, people are cooking with butter and animal fats and making sure what you eat is organic. The food chain is permeated with chemicals now, so always eat organic. Until the third Friday of next month, Merry Christmas.
