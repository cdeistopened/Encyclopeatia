## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month’s *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

This month we are very pleased to welcome Dr. Ray Peat back to the show. We will be exploring the emerging revelation concerning endotoxemia and how unsaturated fats further burden our bodies in ways we could never imagine. Welcome to tonight’s show, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thanks.

**Andrew Murray:** Perhaps for those tuning in, could you outline what endotoxin is, how it is formed, and how it is harmful to our health?

## Defining Endotoxin and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure that people really know what it's doing in the bacterium, but it's been known since 1892. It was called endotoxin to distinguish it from the older known bacterial toxins that the bacteria secrete to poison something in their environment. Supposedly, the endotoxin only comes out when the bacterium is broken apart, but I think actually it leaks a little bit all the time. So I wouldn't say that it's strictly an endotoxin like the textbooks used to say. It is somewhat of a structural protein, but it's a medium-to-smallish molecule that can leak out in the process of growth and cell division.

Its other name is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) because its structure is a chain of sugar molecules with fatty acids attached. That gives it a soap-like behavior that is part of why it is toxic so generally. They are so common in the environment that organisms have their basic defenses against them. One of our basic defenses is the high-density lipoprotein (HDL). They talk about HDL in terms of carrying cholesterol, but I think its historic main function is that it's our first defense against endotoxin once it gets into the bloodstream.

Normally, the intestine is a good barrier against absorbing the endotoxins. If some of it leaks through the wall of the intestine into the blood vessels and gets carried to the liver, the liver enzymes break it down. It shouldn't normally reach the bloodstream in significant amounts, but it's a matter of tens of milligrams that can circulate into the bloodstream every day.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know if there is an acceptable value or level of endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It stimulates defense reactions, so it's kind of a "toughening up" reaction to have a small amount of it. If you're born in a germ-free environment, your first exposure to bacteria is likely to be lethal. Absorbing a little bit of the endotoxin toughens up the system.

**Andrew Murray:** Perhaps this hearkens back to the germ-prevalent society of 100 years ago producing children that had better immune systems and did not have autism or other syndromes associated with the sterile environments of today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think when you try to be too sterile and then are inevitably exposed to germs, the sudden shock is probably a lot more stressful.

## How Endotoxin Damages Cells

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned lipopolysaccharide. How is it harmful to our health if we are exposed to varying amounts of it daily?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It triggers a whole series of reactions. It seems to be a physical-chemical process that stirs up a cell to recognize a threat. It is the things that it sets into action that really cause the chronic, accumulating degenerative damage.

One of the first things it does upon exciting a cell is to cause the cell to take up calcium and to activate the synthesis of nitric oxide. The nitric oxide and the cell excitation that goes with absorbing calcium trigger other reactions. A small amount of endotoxin can stimulate the intestine to contract more, but if the cells are getting overloaded with it, that—and possibly other irritants—can cause cells to produce so much nitric oxide that it becomes a major metabolic disruptor. It will cause the intestine to lose the ability to contract, and it will poison the respiratory apparatus so that cells can't make energy to fight back. At that point, with increased nitric oxide and reduced energy, the cells also take up water.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And then they become basically non-functioning to a degree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they are under stress. If the body can deliver enough energy to them quickly, they can excrete the water and the calcium, turn off the nitric oxide, and return to normal functioning.

When they swell up, the textbooks give a simplified, mistaken idea of what is involved in bowel damage. They talk about the leakage *between* cells, as if the cells lose the glue that holds them in contact so holes open up. That does happen, but it isn't necessarily the worst way that the endotoxin gets into the cells.

As the cytoplasm takes up water, instead of being fat-like and tending to exclude water, the introduction of this sugar connected to a fat acts like a soap. It makes the cell tend to admit not only more water but pretty much anything that is in its environment. The whole substance of the cell becomes spongy and leaky.

When this starts affecting the whole organism, that kind of change occurs all through the body. Once the stuff has passed through the lining of the intestine, crosses capillaries, and gets into the bloodstream, the endotoxin starts doing the same thing to any cell it comes to. It will leak out of capillaries no matter where it is. If it happens to reach the brain, it will cause the brain capillaries to leak whatever is in the bloodstream, which can contribute to Multiple Sclerosis.

Every organ has its particular way of responding, but there is a generality. No matter what the organ, there are basic defense reactions that will occur not only to endotoxin, but to any radical threat to the survival of the cell. X-rays and gamma rays will produce essentially the same kind of change in brain cells or bowel cells that endotoxin does. If you're overexposed to X-rays, for example, you'll get constipated the same way that overexposure to endotoxin will cause constipation.

**Andrew Murray:** So there's a kind of saponification going on then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, an opening up and loosening up of cell structure. If you imagine a lump of gelatin soaked in oil, it will stay stable in the presence of water. But if you mix a little bit of lecithin with it, it will quickly start taking up water, and then the whole thing is on the road to dissolving and breaking up.

## Leaky Gut Syndrome

**Andrew Murray:** Many of our listeners have heard the term "leaky gut." Can you outline what causes a leaky gut and how it leads to this translocation of bacteria or endotoxin into the bloodstream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Endotoxin is always present in the intestine and is the first thing to defend against. But many other stresses and toxins—like radiation, heavy metals, estrogenic substances, or too many polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)—all tend to loosen up or saponify the cell structure. This causes the cell to take up water and let junk enter from the environment into the cell substance itself.

Getting into the cell substance, it can just as easily go out the other side of the cell into the underlying extracellular material, and from there across the capillary cells and into the bloodstream. That is essentially what the leaky gut is: leaky cell substance, which involves leaky capillaries. Ultimately, it can cause leakiness of any tissue.

In pre-cancerous states, for example, you see substance leaking out of the characteristic cell. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is just a normal prostate protein that leaks out because the cell is under stress. The same protein leaks out of breast cells when they're under stress.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So literally, the cell is falling apart, breaking down, and leaking.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And something as simple as Vitamin E can tremendously strengthen the cell and help to hold it together so it doesn't leak its protein substance out into the environment.

**Andrew Murray:** What would be the mechanism behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one really knows, but partly it is stopping the free radical damage that nitric oxide is producing. It helps to keep calcium from overloading the cell and keeps the water from associating too closely with the proteins. The natural hormones progesterone and testosterone also help to toughen up the cell. Factors similar to Vitamin E that are associated with energy production—Coenzyme Q10 and Vitamin K—are extremely powerful at defending the respiratory apparatus from nitric oxide and endotoxin.

## Thyroid, Energy, and Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned the influx of water into the cell due to lack of energy. Would thyroid have a part to play in raising the energy of the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The thyroid is essential for making the enzyme that allows oxygen to absorb electrons out of the mitochondrial system. The mitochondria take up electrons from sugars and fats and derive energy from those electrons as they are passed along to oxygen. Thyroid is the essential factor for making that happen.

There are other supporting factors, such as uncoupling proteins, that make the electrons run more quickly to be taken up by oxygen. What that does is produce carbon dioxide more quickly, which turns off the formation of lactic acid. That, in turn, turns off the nitric oxide forming system. If you can run the system fast enough with plenty of thyroid, you'll make the carbon dioxide, inhibit lactic acid formation, and pretty well defend against producing nitric oxide. This gives you relative immunity to the lipopolysaccharide.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that what they call the electron transport chain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The electrons pass down to oxygen, but they can't do it without thyroid. Temperature is also a factor. When you run the electrons through this system, you produce heat as well as carbon dioxide and ATP. Keeping the temperature up helps turn off the production of nitric oxide and other free radical destructive factors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So all of these harmful X-rays, LPS from bacteria, and excess estrogen are essentially free radicals that are damaging our oxygen usage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Not all free radicals are toxic, but nitric oxide is one that is widely produced in response to stress. It increases greatly with aging, just because aging involves progressive stress reactions.

**Andrew Murray:** I remember "poppers"—drugs that were nitric oxide-based and very damaging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nitroglycerin has been used as a drug to open the circulation of the heart. Nitric oxide didn't really get much interest scientifically until Viagra came along. That is basically doing the same thing as nitroglycerin, but it's extremely toxic. It's like eating toxins, getting irradiated, and getting old ahead of time.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's a powerful free radical that people don't realize creates damage by depleting their bodies of oxygen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some free radicals can actually defend against the toxic free radicals. When the thyroid and oxygen are working properly, the electron transport chain involves lots of free radical activity, but it is all productive and protective. The faster you run oxygen through the mitochondrion under the influence of thyroid, the less free radical damage you have to the structure of the cell.

If you are low thyroid or lack oxygen acutely, the electrons, instead of being safely passed through this chain, wander off and attack the fats that make up the mitochondrion. Those fats become peroxides, which are a randomly destructive kind of free radical.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs)

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** These would be the polyunsaturated fats, which includes corn oil, sunflower seed oil, safflower, canola, fish oil, hemp seed, flax seed, cotton seed, and many packaged foods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. All of those tend to accumulate in the tissues. When they're given acutely as an emulsion—they used to do it in hospitals to fatten people up, and now they do it to suppress immune systems for kidney transplants—they not only suppress immunity but create an instantaneous diabetes or inability to respire and use sugar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if we eat food fried in these oils, we are essentially ingesting a free radical?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very quickly, yes. An experiment I did illustrates how they spontaneously oxidize even at room temperature. I put a rubber hose in a bottle of safflower oil and the other end in a glass of water. Just at room temperature over a few hours, the bottle was in effect "respiring." It was sucking oxygen up and drawing water up into the tube. The oxygen was combining with the unsaturated fats and forming lipid peroxides.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the situation is even worse in our body when it's at 98 degrees.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Much faster at that temperature. And we have catalytic amounts of iron and heavy metals floating around to accelerate the reaction.

**Andrew Murray:** What foods promote or prevent the formation of free radicals and endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since polyunsaturated fats are the main material that causes an explosion of free radicals once the process starts with endotoxin and nitric oxide, simply minimizing those in the diet is a basic way to defend yourself.

There have been studies for 100 years showing that a fat-free diet, if you give the required nutrients, extends lifespan and reduces cancer. A 1927 study showed no spontaneous cancer in rats on a fat-free diet. Roughly 100 studies show the beneficial effects of a so-called deficiency of polyunsaturated fats. When a rat is made "deficient"—meaning they don't feed them PUFAs but give them purified nutrients—those animals can stand tremendous physical trauma that would kill a normal rat. They can be given cobra venom and survive. Toxins that would produce diabetes in normal rats don't hurt the deficient rats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So why are we so brainwashed that these are called "Essential Fatty Acids"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Burrs (George and Mildred Burr), who were promoting that idea from 1929 through the 1930s, were working for the lard and vegetable shortening businesses. When independent researchers checked their claims in the 1940s, they found the Burrs had simply produced a Vitamin B6 deficiency. The polyunsaturated fats poison thyroid function, raising the metabolic rate by about 50%. If you feed them only a normal amount of vitamins, they become deficient. Researchers in 1946 cured the syndrome by giving extra Vitamin B6.

However, in the 1950s, the industry went through a change. They discovered they could economize on food for pigs and chickens by poisoning their thyroid glands so they wouldn't eat as much but would still get fat. They found that polyunsaturated fats suppress the metabolic rate. That was when feeding pigs a diet of corn and soy took off.

At the same time, the paint industry discovered how to turn petroleum into paints and plastics, so they didn't need linseed or safflower oil anymore. The soy oil industry needed another market besides animal feed, so they convinced people to eat the production they couldn't sell as paint.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the story continues into 2009.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After 50 years, the original data—that vegetable oils caused softening of the brain, infertility, and cancer—became too public. Everyone was catching on that linoleic acid was carcinogenic. So about 20 or 30 years ago, marketing shifted to fish oil. The fish industry was being pressured by the EPA to stop dumping waste in bays. They made fish protein from skins and heads, and since the oil spoiled so fast, they marketed it for human medical use.

**Andrew Murray:** It's a lesson through history that wherever there's a waste product, there's an industry to turn it into a profitable product.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Shrimp shells are now a medical product. I'm waiting for used tires to come out.

## Liver Detoxification and Albumin

**Andrew Murray:** I want to go back to the liver breaking down endotoxin. How do you view liver health and how would you approach improving it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver has several ways to catch toxins. The brain is our second most active detoxifying organ. But if the liver is spending too much energy detoxifying, it becomes unable to produce albumin. Albumin circulating in the blood is one of the layers of defense.

When we're being poisoned, the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) made in the liver increases. Estrogen and alcohol increase HDL.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And this is what doctors tell us is the "good cholesterol."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it is good because it's a reaction to being poisoned, so it helps protect when we're having a bowel problem.

**Andrew Murray:** So if you have low HDL, that may indicate you don't have a high toxin load?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The albumin in the blood binds fatty molecules. Between albumin and lipoproteins, our blood can hold a lot of stuff temporarily to give the liver a chance to catch up.

When the liver is poisoned—estrogen and radiation can do the same thing as endotoxin—the ability to form albumin decreases. Looking at albumin in a blood test is one of the first indicators of a person's basic resistance. If it's high, their prognosis is usually good. If it's down around 3 (where normal is 4.5), you're going to have to clean out the bowel. I've seen people go from below 3 up to over 4 in just a couple of weeks just by eating fiber and fruit juice to reduce the absorption of endotoxin.

## Caller: Crohn's Disease and Medical Knowledge

**Caller:** I have a question for Dr. Peat, but first I'd like to make a statement. I am living proof that what this man is saying is the truth. I have had Crohn's for about 20 years. I've had four major surgeries, had all but 12 inches of my intestines removed, and have a double ostomy. By changing my diet, I no longer have any Crohn's symptoms whatsoever. My question is: Do common doctors understand these things? And if they do, why don't they tell their families?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The average doctor learns his high school courses very well. Then, the medical school courses on the alimentary canal and digestive physiology are really just a repeat of junior high and high school textbooks. So doctors get a very superficial picture of nutrition and digestion. I've been running into more fairly famous gastroenterologists who are barely better than the junior high textbooks.

**Caller:** I believe they are just trained to be drug pushers. Thank you so much for your wisdom.

## Caller: Heart Rate and Metabolism

**Caller:** You had spoken last month about a raised heartbeat being preferable. Since then, I've heard the opposite on another show.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why do people feel better when they have a pulse above 80, when we are taught that an athletic heart rate of 60 is healthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain needs oxygen and sugar. Unless you have a very big heart, it usually takes around 80 or 90 beats per minute to pump enough oxygen and sugar to the tissues to keep them warm.

Over the last 30 years, the normal temperature doctors look for has decreased considerably. From the beginning of thermometers, normal was around 37°C (98.6°F). In recent years, the average temperature of Americans has decreased. That means the heart rate can go slower, and the person feels they're getting enough, but they don't really feel as good as they should. I've talked to people who had temporary episodes of hyperthyroidism where their heart rate went to 125 for a couple of months, and consistently they say they never felt so good in their life.

## Iodine and Thyroid Health

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** A previous caller wanted to know if kelp and iodine-rich seaweeds are good for thyroid health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have about 80 articles in my file on the toxic effects of getting excess iodine. Thyroid cancer is increasing at a tremendous rate. I think part of it is the polyunsaturated fats, but another part is a chronic, lifelong overdose of iodine. Taking more than twice the essential minimum of iodine is enough to increase the rate of thyroiditis and antibody attacks on the thyroid.

## Caller: Saturated Fats and Protective Measures

**Caller:** Could you speak briefly on saturated fats and if they're beneficial? Also, you mentioned Vitamin E and Coenzyme Q10; are there other proactive things to do to heal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Saturated fats are very protective, but you can make your own saturated fats if you eat enough sugar, like fruits, instead of breads. There are groups curing cirrhosis and hepatitis by giving more saturated fats and excluding the unsaturated entirely. They are anti-inflammatory and therapeutic. But you don't necessarily have to eat the saturated fats because you can make them if you get enough sugar in the form of fruit.

Regarding other suggestions: Anything that speeds transit through the intestine helps. Aspirin, surprisingly, can act as a laxative because it suppresses nitric oxide and defends against endotoxin.

The fibers that are protective and don't support bacterial growth are the basic way to stimulate quick passage and minimize endotoxin formation. Raw carrots and boiled bamboo shoots are very good fibers because they are germicidal as well as being able to bind the endotoxin and other toxins.

## Caller: IBS and Wheat

**Caller:** I've suffered from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) all my life. I became vegan, and then recently took wheat out of my diet. Once I took the wheat out, I haven't had a problem. Could you explain what is really happening with IBS?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is basically an inflamed bowel. The same chemicals that can cause the usual paralysis that develops with aging (constipation) can shift over to causing intensified peristalsis, leading to diarrhea. It's an inflammatory process triggered by irritants.

Wheat and other seeds contain chemicals that the plants use for defense. The two major problems with seeds, especially grains like wheat, are:
1.  **Gluten:** This storage protein resembles a protein our tissues make under the influence of estrogen or stress. If a person has a problem controlling estrogen, that predisposes them to react violently to gluten.
2.  **Chemical Weapons:** Seeds are the next generation of the plant. The plant puts its most intense toxins into the seeds to interfere with grazing animals. They are specifically designed to interfere with animal metabolism. Vegetarians often forget how toxic plants have to be because they can't run or fight; they use chemical weapons.

## Cascara and Constipation

**Andrew Murray:** I have one more question regarding bowel endotoxin. You are a big exponent of Cascara (*Rhamnus purshiana*). Native Americans have used it for centuries. How do you view the action of Cascara?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of these responses to inflammation tend to become progressive and can lead to the death of nerves in the intestine. It's better to use a substance like a plant drug rather than suffer the consequences of inflammation.

Cascara has structural analogies to many of our own substances. Vitamin K, Coenzyme Q10, and progesterone have structural similarities to Cascara. It reinforces our defense systems. It is very unusual among drugs because it reinforces all the good processes—it is anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, helps reduce anxiety, and increases energy production the way thyroid and progesterone do.

Early in the century, Dr. W.F. Koch began working out how to defend our cellular respiratory system from toxins. He explored quinones, like those in Brazil wood, and found that they work with Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Coenzyme Q10, and thyroid to maintain and protect respiration.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. For those who would like to consult further, Dr. Ray Peat can be contacted via his website at www.raypeat.com. Good night.
