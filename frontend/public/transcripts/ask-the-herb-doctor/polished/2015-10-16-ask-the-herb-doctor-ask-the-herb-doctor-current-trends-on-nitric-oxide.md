## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions. Tonight’s subject is a continuation of a previous topic on nitric oxide and the current trends surrounding it. In the last year or two, both the sports industry—specifically for muscle building and male performance enhancement—and the medical community have promoted it.

However, there is a lot of recent research showing that nitric oxide is actually a very negative product, even though we produce it naturally. It has wide-ranging damaging effects. Dr. Peat’s research details the evidence supporting what we are going to talk about tonight. Nitric oxide has implications for conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to diabetes, generalized inflammation, and old age. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for your time. For those who may not have heard of you, would you describe your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I did my master's degree in humanities at the University of Oregon and then went back years later in biology for a PhD. I intended to study brain biology but quickly shifted to reproductive aging physiology. I concentrated on the biochemistry of the steroid hormones in relation to aging.

## The Dangers of Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** I want to open by discussing what people find if they search online. Unfortunately, the internet is rife with misconceptions. Nitric oxide is touted to help the immune system, regulate blood pressure, improve sleep, and is heavily advertised for endurance, bodybuilding, and sexual performance. Dr. Peat, given that we produce it naturally, why does it have so many negative effects?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And why do they claim it is used for all those conditions when it isn't true? Where are they twisting the truth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My dissertation in 1972 focused on estrogen, but I saw that the effects of estrogen were indistinguishable from the effects of X-rays, aging, and oxygen deprivation. It works by changing the oxidative enzyme function, cytochrome oxidase. It was known that smog produces nitric oxide, but it wasn't known that it occurred naturally in the body until the late 80s. The nitric oxide in smog was known to inhibit or damage that same respiratory enzyme.

At the time I was studying estrogen, it was known that carbon monoxide and cyanide also blocked the effect of oxygen in the cell. No one really thought about what nitric oxide was doing to the cell, except regarding smog exposure. As soon as it was discovered that it was produced in the body, a series of publications identified the harm it did in various tissues. For example, several papers clearly showed how inflammation or stress-increasing nitric oxide damages the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It is a major cause of diabetes. They saw similar damage to every tissue they looked at, which seemed logical since it was a free radical analogous to cyanide and carbon monoxide.

However, someone noticed that nitric oxide causes vasodilation during arousal, and Viagra came on the scene with a tremendous amount of funding for research.

**Andrew Murray:** This was about 15 years ago?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, around 1997. Suddenly all the bad stuff was forgotten, and everyone wanted to find out the curative effects of the drug that could improve virility. Very soon after it came out, I started hearing from people who were suffering things such as diabetes from taking virility pills.

**Andrew Murray:** There is a positive association between cardiac arrest and Viagra use, isn't there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is probably killing more people than are being identified. Nitric oxide is produced in any stressed cell or tissue, and it decreases the function of the tissue by blocking energy production. It creates a vicious circle, the same way too much estrogen or stress can. It starts a cycle of energy loss, increased production of stress mediators (including nitric oxide), exciting the tissue, blocking the energy of the tissue, and leaving the cell to die.

## Muscle Growth and Inflammation

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is there any thread of truth to the claims that it helps muscle growth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It actually does make muscles grow, but that is one of the things Szent-Györgyi and Otto Warburg understood 50 years ago: in the absence of oxygen, life can't do anything but grow and divide. Anything that blocks cytochrome c oxidase—blocking oxidative metabolism—tends to stimulate cell division because that's all life can do on the lactic acid-producing cycle.

Experiments with nitric oxide supplements, or creating conditions like cutting off blood supply to cause muscle tissue to produce its own excess nitric oxide, found that it stimulated the multiplication of cells. The satellite cells surrounding the muscle fiber multiply under the influence of nitric oxide or simply hypoxia.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's a very inflammatory process. Even though they describe it as wonderful for muscle growth, it’s actually damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They found you could cause muscle enlargement just by putting on a tourniquet. It causes really big muscle growth from injuring it. Cells divide like cancer when they don't have the energy to do what they should do.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's a negative response to stimulation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Anytime you injure a tissue, whether in the brain, heart, or blood vessel, stem cells multiply. The lack of oxygen temporarily stimulates multiplication of stem-like cells which have the potential of regenerating the tissue.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's a natural process to stimulate cell growth, but they're twisting it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is always a local, microscopic process when it's natural. But if you flood the system hoping to grow all your muscles bigger, then your brain, immune system, and gonads are effectively being deprived of oxygen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So drugs that increase nitric oxide would be classified as carcinogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that is starting to be recognized. It is a very basic factor in promoting cancer development, growth, and spreading.

## Blood Pressure and Vasodilation

**Andrew Murray:** Is there any truth to the vasodilatory effects helping people with blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does that. Nitroglycerin was used for a long time to open up heart arteries. You do increase the flow of blood by relaxing the arterioles. The trouble is, if you increase it beyond temporary dilation, it starts the damaging process of increasing collagen formation and cell multiplication. You can get a momentary effect from nitroglycerin, but as a chronic or systemic thing, it is not good. In fact, it ages you.

For example, in irritable bowel syndrome, you absorb both nitric oxide and endotoxin. The endotoxin increases the production of nitric oxide everywhere. In the blood vessels, the chronic effect of nitric oxide is to promote thickening, atherosclerosis, and hardening of the arteries.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it actually worsens the condition you're taking it for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The momentary effect can be helpful if you have a constricted area, but systemically, you are adding to chronic inflammation and degeneration. One of the things it does is increase aldosterone, the adrenal salt-regulating steroid, which produces inflammation and fibrosis as a side effect.

**Andrew Murray:** Aldosterone is also implicated in blood pressure regulation, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, too much aldosterone gives you high blood pressure. So the side effect of chronic nitric oxide can be exactly the opposite of what they're promoting.

## Inhibiting Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of inhibiting nitric oxide, I found two compounds. One was aminoguanidine, which is sold as a blocker of the glycation process.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was its first recognized effect, but it turns out it achieves that by blocking nitric oxide, which leads to the oxidation damage of blood vessels.

**Andrew Murray:** Is aminoguanidine a reasonable approach to systemic inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it probably is, but there are safer things that have been studied more. The safest inhibitors happen to be **niacinamide**, **aspirin**, and **progesterone**.

**Andrew Murray:** I’ve seen **methylene blue** mentioned as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that is another pretty safe inhibitor. But first I would try aspirin, niacinamide, and progesterone as they are the most physiological.

**Andrew Murray:** What dosage would be reasonable for niacinamide or aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For aspirin, if you take Vitamin K, it is safe up to several grams a day. Usually, two doses of 500mg provide good systemic protection. Vitamin K also helps hold down nitric oxide production. For niacinamide, it is probably safe up to 1,000mg a day, but I've seen people take three or four doses of 125mg (totaling 200-500mg a day) do dramatic things for curing nerve degeneration.

## Caller: Cystic Fibrosis

**Caller:** I wanted to know if Dr. Peat could briefly discuss cystic fibrosis and practical strategies for overcoming it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never worked with anyone that had it, except some people who suspected they might have it, and it turned out they were just very hypothyroid. The function of the adrenals can cause you to leak chloride, leading to extreme saltiness of the skin, which is often used to diagnose cystic fibrosis. Just correcting the thyroid and adrenal function in the people I've seen resolved it; they turned out not to have cystic fibrosis, just a bad reaction to low thyroid function.

## Caller: Nose Breathing and Fat Loss

**Amy (New York):** I'm studying a breathing method that's supposed to increase carbon dioxide levels by always breathing through the nose. I was worried whether that would increase my nitric oxide levels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Anything that irritates your membranes will cause nitric oxide. You want to avoid inflammatory things in your food or atmosphere, but breathing through your nose itself doesn't contribute to that. The idea of breathing through your nose is that it extends the dead space so that you keep a higher concentration of CO2.

**Amy:** I have another question. You mentioned a study regarding pigs wearing sweaters that ended up with larger stores of saturated fats. Is that a viable strategy for people in cold climates who want to lose stored unsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping your arms and legs warm is very important for your systemic metabolism. The pig study demonstrated that the production of unsaturated fats is a defense against cold because saturated fats harden at low temperatures. When you synthesize unsaturated fats from sugar or starch, they are going to be safe Omega-9 fats (Mead acid), which are much less unstable than the fish oil type.

**Amy:** So it changed the new stored fat, but didn't change the burning preference of existing stores?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping your body temperature up helps you oxidize fat safely.

**Amy:** What about brown fat? People take cold showers to increase brown fat to burn off white fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think keeping your thyroid function up is better. Cold activates stress hormones that cause side effects. To oxidize your fats while at rest by having a good resting metabolic rate and high body temperature is the safest way, rather than increasing stress to increase fat burning.

## Caller: Thyroid Medication and Eye Pain

**Caller (Madison, WI):** I've been taking T4. It's working well, but I get some eye pain in the process of titrating it. I started on 7 micrograms and went up to 12. Is that normal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't heard of that, but I would back off on the T4. If your liver isn't effectively converting it to T3, it can have an anti-thyroid effect by accumulating and turning off your pituitary. If your liver isn't converting it, you can accumulate so much T4 that it has stress-activating actions.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think it would be better to try the active hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's always better to use the combination [of T3 and T4] in the traditional way. Or, if you have a sluggish liver, small amounts of active T3 can be used safely.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** T4 on its own doesn't have any action; it has to be converted to T3. If you take enough T4, you turn off your brain's stimulation of the thyroid gland.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, drug companies synthesized thyroxine (T4) and tested it on male medical students, claiming it worked just like real thyroid. But women with high estrogen compared to men always have a more sluggish liver. Thyroxine is very often causing problems in women.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** T4 can actually make low-thyroid people feel worse by increasing adrenaline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the effects of good thyroid function is to lower nitric oxide. Nitric oxide, contrary to advertising, can increase pressure inside your eye. Hypothyroidism can create enough nitric oxide to cause symptoms such as hardening of the eye and increasing pressure.

**Caller:** That's interesting. I was switching over from cortisol to thyroid and wondered if my eye was running low on energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cortisol increases the pressure in the eye, so it's possible you were still producing too much cortisol relative to the protective pregnenolone and progesterone.

**Caller:** What percentage of popular lab tests are fraudulent or useless? My doctor said my TSH was normal, but when I went off thyroid, I had symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors are taught that the TSH normal range is something like 0.4 to 5.0. However, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has lowered it to 0.3 to 3.0. In a population of healthy people without thyroid problems, they average 0.4 TSH or less without supplements.

**Andrew Murray:** So if you are over 1.0 or 1.5, you would likely benefit from the hormone.

**Caller:** I think I was at 3.7.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't it correct that while someone might be taking T4 and not converting it to T3, their TSH would still lower?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and stress hormones will lower it too. So you can't really diagnose anything by TSH alone. High cortisol lowers TSH and simultaneously causes the liver to turn thyroxine into reverse T3, which interferes with active T3 function.

## Nitric Oxide and DNA Damage

**Andrew Murray:** I saw articles demonstrating that nitric oxide was responsible for damaging DNA, implicating it as a carcinogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Radiation biologists saw that cells hit by X-rays emitted something that caused radiation damage in the neighborhood. Nitric oxide turned out to be a major transmitter of that effect. It spreads to adjoining cells. Nitric oxide not only breaks DNA strands but also changes methylation, altering the control system for expressing DNA.

## Caller: Blood Pressure Alternatives

**Caller (Eureka):** I wanted to know what alternative there is to blood pressure medicines.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the symptoms of chronic hypothyroidism, hypertension is one of the prominent things. A very large proportion of people who think they have a high blood pressure problem are simply hypothyroid. TSH itself, which rises when you're hypothyroid, increases stress hormones and blood pressure. So TSH is a pro-inflammatory factor causing hypertension.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You could ask your doctor for a TSH test. If it's above 0.4, perhaps think about taking a thyroid supplement.

## COPD and Lung Function

**Andrew Murray:** We had a caller ask about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). How do you see the etiology or treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known several people who had it. One friend in his 80s was blue in the face and panting just sitting down. His brain wasn't getting enough oxygen. I gave his daughter some pregnenolone, progesterone, and thyroid to give him. When I came back two weeks later, he was back at work in his upper-floor office, dramatically improved.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that how someone could regain their breath?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. High estrogen and nitric oxide can cause leakage of fluid into the air sacs and a thickening of the pathway between the air and the capillary. Pregnenolone seems to sometimes very quickly improve oxygenation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What would be a recommended starting dose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With thyroid, you want to start very slowly because it increases your need for oxygen. It's good to start with pregnenolone, which helps prevent edema. 15 to 30 milligrams is often a therapeutic dose. With progesterone, 10 to 30 milligrams can make a big difference.

## Antibiotics and Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** I saw articles demonstrating that **minocycline** lowered the inducible form of nitric oxide. What do you think about minocycline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For several years it's been recognized as helpful for Alzheimer's disease and other brain problems. It directly blocks the enzyme [that creates nitric oxide], the way niacinamide does.

**Andrew Murray:** What about **tetracycline**?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's in the same family. The only problem with tetracycline is that it's too cheap, so doctors are not educated to use it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wonder if **Cascara** would have a similar effect because it has anthraquinones that are very similar to tetracycline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that structure is what is happening.

## Caller: Human Growth Hormone

**Caller (Ukiah):** Can you talk about Human Growth Hormone (HGH)? My friends in weightlifting talk about it to build muscle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have the same problems that you get from nitric oxide or estrogen. Women chronically have high growth hormone during reproductive years. Growth hormone causes a breakdown of fat into free fatty acids. This increases oxidative damage. That is likely why they see increased thickness in blood vessel walls in the kidneys, causing progressive loss of kidney function from chronic exposure to growth hormone. There is a suspicion that it increases the risk of diabetes, which free fatty acids are known to cause.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's very inflammatory.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And people want to avoid supplements touted to increase nitric oxide, like arginine and citrulline.

**Andrew Murray:** We need to wrap up. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time and dedication.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
