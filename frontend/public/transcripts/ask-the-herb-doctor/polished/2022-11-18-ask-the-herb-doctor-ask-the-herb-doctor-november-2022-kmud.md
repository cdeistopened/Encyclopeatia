## Introduction

**Radio Host:** Andrew and Sarah haven't arrived, and Dr. Peat isn't answering the phone. However, I have a recording of Dr. Ray Peat from the *Strong Sistas* YouTube channel. I’m going to play that now. They are discussing foods to prioritize versus foods to avoid.

## Essential Foods to Prioritize

**Interviewer:** If it were up to you, what are 5 to 10 essential food items that you would recommend somebody includes in their diet? What foods should people prioritize eating regularly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends a lot on your situation, but very safe and highly nutritious foods—which are convenient as well as safe in the long run—include milk, cheese without additives, eggs, low-starch fruit, and generally meat and fish that are not high in polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs). Depending on your ability to digest them, well-cooked vegetables are very good for most people. What I've left out are mostly grains, legumes, and other seed-related parts such as nuts.

**Interviewer:** Would you say that you are not incorporating nuts, seeds, and legumes because of the PUFAs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not just that. Plants create a storage form of nutrients to support the embryo's development. Those nutrients have to be in an insoluble form so they don't wash away while the seed is waiting to germinate. They have to be mobilized in an organized way.

Those preparations for the seed embryo go with specific defenses against those same nutrients being used by predators—such as mammals, worms, insects, or fungus. Essentially, they have pesticides or insecticides incorporated into the seed chemistry. They put their most special blockers of digestion, neurotoxins, and digestive toxins into the seed as self-defense because the seed is the essential, most important part of the plant. The plant can grow new leaves if a predator eats them, but the seed is the long-term existence of the plant. So, the worst toxins, as far as animals are concerned, are in the seeds.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs) and Metabolism

**Interviewer:** Can you expand a little bit on PUFAs? Beyond nuts and seeds, how do you view PUFAs influencing cells and causing insulin resistance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cold organisms have to survive the winter. Cold storage is very good for a seed. Insects, fish, and frogs can live daily life at a very low temperature, close to freezing. When a seed is ready to germinate in the spring, or when a fish or insect moves in the cold, they have to mobilize their enzymes. There has to be mobility in the cells.

Saturated fats harden at a moderate temperature. If you put butter in the fridge, it becomes very hard. Even olive oil solidifies in the refrigerator. An animal or plant living in the north at a low temperature simply can't survive if it uses saturated fats for energy storage. In proportion to the coldness of the climate, they remove hydrogens from the fats, making them liquid at cold temperatures.

However, the degree of unsaturation—the removal of hydrogens to make them liquid oils—makes them highly oxidizable. If you increase the temperature of a fish to human temperature (98 degrees), it very quickly stinks. If you put highly unsaturated seed oil or fish oil at body temperature, they will quickly start to harden. The oxidation spreads and hardens them into solid masses.

If an organism is going to live outside of that cold environment, they have to get rid of the polyunsaturated fats. The warmer the environment, the more saturated their fat has to be to survive, because the highly unsaturated fats simply turn to glue—a plastic-like material that is totally incompatible with life.

**Interviewer:** What does that do for metabolism? What part of the cellular metabolism do PUFAs interfere with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a person eats a seed oil, the first thing it does is block the digestive proteolytic enzymes in the stomach and intestine, impairing protein digestion.

When it gets into the blood, if it reaches your thyroid gland, it inhibits the proteolytic enzyme needed to form thyroid hormone. Circulating in the blood, it keeps thyroid hormones from being transported on the blood proteins. When it gets into the cells, it blocks the action of thyroid to stimulate respiration.

So, the polyunsaturated fat inhibits respiration and blocks energy production. At the same time, it starts to degrade and produce reactive oxidative fragments that are toxic to cells. Furthermore, circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids intensify estrogen actions. They release estrogen from binding proteins, making it more active, and they activate estrogen receptors, imitating the actions of estrogen. They systematically impair metabolism.

**Interviewer:** From my understanding, PUFAs cause our fat cells to become insulin sensitive, and that's not what we want. We want our fat cells to become insulin resistant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that is just one of the many consequences.

## Monounsaturated Fats (Olive Oil and Avocado)

**Interviewer:** Some people question the role of monounsaturated fats. How do olive oil or avocado compare to PUFAs versus the saturated fats you recommend, like coconut oil or animal fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When we eat carbohydrates in excess, we make our own saturated fats. If we are free of polyunsaturated fats, we can modify a certain percentage of our saturated fats. We can unsaturate them midway down the fatty acid molecule at carbon number nine. This is closer to the acidic head of the fat molecule, which makes it safer from oxidation.

The ones we produce from saturated fats or carbohydrates are called the Omega-9 series fatty acids. Those happen to be anti-inflammatory and are protective against the plant-derived Omega-3 or Omega-6 fatty acids.

**Interviewer:** Are you saying that the Omega-9s—oleic acid—are protective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. That is the major fat in avocados and olive oil.

**Interviewer:** Are the Omega-9s we get from avocado or olive oil protective against Omega-6s and 3s, or only the Omega-9s we produce in our bodies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ones we produce in our bodies independently are purely protective and anti-inflammatory. The trouble with olive oil is that it usually contains about 10% PUFA. If you eat more than one or two teaspoons of olive oil per day, you're at risk of accumulating that 10% highly unsaturated fat. It will build up gradually over time and offset the protective effect of the Omega-9. But if your calorie intake is fairly low and you don't overeat olive oil, then those will be disposed of safely.

**Interviewer:** That's an important point. Caloric surpluses can amplify some of these negative consequences.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, eating excess calories causes these to go into storage and build up over time.

## Fish and Essential Fatty Acids

**Interviewer:** Thinking of the way we grew up, I can't imagine how many PUFAs we've accumulated. You mentioned fish earlier. Do you have a role in your diet for fish high in essential fatty acids, like salmon or salmon roe? Or do you prefer white fish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salmon is terrible because of its high content of polyunsaturated fats. If you can't eat tropical fish—like in the Amazon river where the water is warm and fish fat is as saturated as butterfat—you can select cold-water fish with a very low body fat content. Cod and sole, for example, are much better than salmon.

**Interviewer:** How did the Inuits get by with very little health problems when they were eating a diet high in cold-water fish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a very harmful diet. If you have a high metabolic rate and are able to oxidize the fats as fast as you eat them, they won't accumulate at a dangerous rate. But if you're fairly sedentary and tend to add a little fat every day, you're going to run into accumulated pro-inflammatory oxidative conditions.

There are claims that since the brain contains high levels of Omega-3, they are necessary for the brain. However, the baby at birth doesn't contain them, yet develops a fully normal, functional brain. In dementia, these polyunsaturated fats accumulate in the brain bound to cholesterol. In proportion to dementia, the brain contains more Omega-3 fatty acids.

The story to promote the sale of fish oil is basically crooked. They are immunosuppressive; they knock out your white blood cell function. The oxidative breakdown products cause damage and suppression of the immune system.

**Interviewer:** Do you have any resources you would suggest for someone to read regarding the potential downsides of these "essential" fatty acids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Someone recently sent me a draft of an extremely good book on polyunsaturated fats. It has a thousand references but is very readable. It isn't available right now, but it will be published imminently.

## The Case for Sugar

**Interviewer:** Moving on to a controversial topic: Can you make the case for sugar? What role does sugar play in a diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a highly digestible starch, it quickly breaks down into glucose and provides safe energy. But many starches are hard to digest. For someone with sluggish digestion, starches tend to support bacterial overgrowth in the intestine.

Vegetables are fine when your digestive system is working well. But if you have digestive limitations—bacterial overgrowth, slow peristalsis, or nocturnal reflux—starches make symptoms worse. In that case, a low-starch fruit, such as citrus, can be a perfect source of carbohydrates. You need some kind of carbohydrate to safely metabolize fats and proteins.

**Interviewer:** So sugar provides fast energy that doesn't cause the digestion problems that starches or vegetables might?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it doesn't require digestion, so it absorbs right in your stomach and upper intestine. Even if you have a perfectly digestible starch, it has the same quick reaction that pure glucose does—it is a powerful stimulant to insulin. If you eat too much starch, it activates insulin secretion and turns the excess sugar into fat. That sudden surge of insulin lowers your blood sugar, which can cause stress reactions.

The difference with sucrose (the common sugar in fruits) is that it is only 50% glucose. It doesn't have the glycemic reaction that starch has; it is only half as able to stimulate insulin. The fructose component actually has a mild insulin-inhibiting effect. So, it provides sugar energy much more gradually than starch and tends to avoid the glucose-insulin-hypoglycemia stress reaction.

**Interviewer:** Where do the anti-fructose arguments come from? For example, the idea that because fructose doesn't spike insulin, it automatically leads to fat storage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Naturally, if you overeat fat, protein, starch, or sucrose, you're going to get fat. The anti-sugar argument started in the 50s with the idea that sugar stimulates hypoglycemia and adrenaline.

Later, John Yudkin wrote a book claiming sugar turns to saturated fat, and since they believed saturated fat caused heart disease, he argued sugar caused heart disease. It was a doubly wrong argument.

More recently, Robert Lustig made arguments that fructose is as toxic as alcohol. I looked up his references, and they didn't support his argument at all. In fact, fructose is a powerful, specific antidote to ethanol poisoning—absolutely the reverse of what he says. Ethanol, like a high-fat diet, shifts the electronic balance of the cell metabolism toward a reducing state. This is the same state caused by starvation or the ketogenic principle. Fructose does the opposite.

## Reintroducing Carbohydrates

**Interviewer:** Considering we came from a keto and carnivore background, what is the best way to start incorporating sugar after starving the body of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think you have to work gradually into it. A dose of sugar, as long as it isn't grossly excessive, will be the best antidote to the poisoning you experienced in the starvation condition. Ketones from outside your body (like in fruits and vegetables) are protective, just like sugar. They start the repair process of lowering stress hormones and getting cellular oxidation going again.

**Interviewer:** What do you say to the argument that our ancestors didn't have access to carbohydrates and relied on animal fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at primates, the longest-lived in proportion to body size is the squirrel monkey. They have a pure fruit diet and live an average of 30 years. Brain development is in proportion to the amount of sugar provided to developing nerve tissue. It requires sugar energy. To develop a brain, primates had to have a relatively high carbohydrate diet.

**Interviewer:** Some argue Homo sapiens are different from chimpanzees. Is there evidence from our early lineage that carbohydrates were beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is fossil evidence regarding isotopes that shows the importance of carbohydrate in brain development. One of the African precursors of Homo sapiens lived on a type of giant grass, similar to sugar cane, along the Nile River. They had specially developed molars for mashing the sugary juice out of this reed and had very well-developed frames. Many arguments to the contrary are ideological; they shape the evidence to fit the argument.

**Interviewer:** You've also said our current environment is very different regarding stress, 5G, and pollution.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the last 50 years, conditions have radically changed. For example, the atmospheric nuclear testing in 1963 loaded the Northern Hemisphere with radioactive isotopes. Vaccination schedules have risen to something like 60 per child. These environmental influences—radiation damage, for example—are amplified by polyunsaturated fats and estrogens. Estrogen and PUFAs synergize with ionizing radiation in tissue damage.

## Diabetes and Sugar

**Interviewer:** What would you say to someone with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes? Many people go low-carb to manage these.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing to consider is: how was it diagnosed? For 50 years, I've asked people this. You cannot diagnose Type 1 without measuring insulin, but very few actually have their insulin measured. They are treated based on blood glucose.

The most common cause for high glucose is stress causing unopposed cortisol secretion. If you don't measure insulin or cortisol, you might be doing the wrong treatment. To lower cortisol, sugar is the most powerful treatment. Doctors in the late 19th century were curing terminal "diabetic" patients—who were wasting away even on meat diets—by feeding them ordinary white sugar alongside their meat and potatoes. They recovered.

## Weight Loss Protocol

**Interviewer:** If you were 50 or 60 pounds overweight, what would you do to lose weight?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, stop eating for a while. Then, go on a low-fat milk and cheese diet with a little bit of orange juice and an occasional egg and oyster.

Calcium and Vitamin D are supportive of the thyroid hormone. It's good to check your thyroid and Vitamin D if you are overweight because deficiency is common and slows metabolism. A high PUFA intake suppresses Vitamin D and thyroid metabolism.

You want to lower the phosphate in your diet relative to calcium. Milk and cheese as the staple will tremendously increase heat production, energy metabolism, and oxygen consumption, making it much easier to lose weight. Moderate amounts of egg and shellfish (like oysters) provide trace minerals.

**Interviewer:** That isn't purely focused on calories, but on nutrients for organ function. Do calories still matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but the difference is that a person who has been dieting will often be burning calories at a rate of only 700 or 800 per day. They get fat on just a few snacks.

When you shift to a high calcium-to-phosphate ratio and high protein relative to fat—with enough carbohydrate to handle the metabolism without stress—that will very quickly increase your calorie consumption from 800 up to a normal 2,000 per day. This makes it tremendously easier to lose weight. As you stay out of the stress condition, you will put on muscle as part of your ability to burn more calories.
