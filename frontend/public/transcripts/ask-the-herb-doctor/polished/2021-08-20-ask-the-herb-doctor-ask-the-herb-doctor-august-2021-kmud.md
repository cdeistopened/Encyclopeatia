## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. From 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you are invited to call in with questions related to this month's topic of iron and its dangers. Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us again. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining again. When the subject of iron was suggested as a topic, I started looking at articles from PubMed and the National Institutes of Health. I wanted to preface the show with something I've written to let people know clearly where the show content is going and where the evidence is coming from.

I know you've written several newsletters and articles related to the dangers of iron. It seems pertinent to the information and science surrounding the inflammatory nature of COVID, especially surrounding the thousands of fatalities in people receiving the experimental drug from thromboembolic processes. This is added to the acute and chronic inflammatory processes stimulated by receiving this drug, and the potential massive autoimmune disease going forward.

Tonight, we will be discussing the link between iron, estrogen, and the suppression of peptides like cathelicidin and hepcidin. We will discuss the experimental drug for COVID-19 and the rising numbers of deaths and adverse events reported to VAERS. With this in mind, we are pleased to welcome Dr. Peat to discuss the physiology of inflammation and its relationship to COVID-19.

Dr. Peat, regarding the serious outcomes of COVID—people on ventilators or those who have died—and the relationship between iron and inflammation, would you like to discuss the physiology of this process? Let's put some science to the mechanism of inflammation and look for a strategic solution.

## The Physiology of Iron and Inflammation

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are lots of ways that iron triggers inflammation, but the best way to start thinking about it is that inflammation triggers the excessive uptake and retention of iron. Inflammation often affects hepcidin, which is a germicidal peptide that also regulates iron. Its function is to suppress the absorption of iron. When you have enough iron, you increase your hepcidin, which is virucidal and bactericidal, and it blocks the absorption of iron.

However, one of the effects of inflammation is to increase the absorption and retention of iron. When it is extreme, it ends up damaging cells, such as the red blood cells. When you are stressed by anything, you tend to release free fatty acids into your bloodstream. Too many free fatty acids activate destabilizing things that tend to dissolve your red cells and activate lipid peroxidation. Under stress, the lifespan of your red blood cells is shorter, meaning they are increasing your iron burden—the free, dangerous, uncontrolled iron.

Another effect of inflammation is that it increases the enzyme heme oxygenase. This enzyme breaks down the heme group. When your red blood cells have leaked hemoglobin, the heme itself is a dangerous, wild catalyst leading to lipid peroxidation. It has to be disposed of. But in breaking down heme, this heme oxygenase enzyme liberates bilirubin (the chemical involved in jaundice), creates a molecule of carbon monoxide, and liberates a free atom of iron.

Chronic stress makes you dispose of these heme groups constantly. Especially in the brain, they are very dangerous. This stress-induced heme oxygenase is constantly dropping these random iron atoms along with carbon monoxide and bilirubin. This is probably one of the major factors in iron overload. It is an internal process involving the breaking down of red cells.

At the same time, lowered hepcidin under stress leads you to retain more iron from your food. Inflammation—specifically pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukins, prostaglandins like PGE2, and tumor necrosis factor—activates aromatase, producing estrogen. So, estrogen goes up in inflammation. Under the influence of high estrogen, a woman will retain several times as much of the iron in her food as a man does who isn't under stress. There are several vicious circles: inflammation leads to heme oxygenase, which leads to estrogen, which leads to more inflammation and iron retention.

## Testing for Iron Overload

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This is something that can be easily tested on a blood test, right? You can look at the iron saturation on a blood test.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The transferrin saturation percentage is probably the most useful thing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that better than the iron saturation percentage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is what they mean when they say iron saturation—it is how loaded the transferrin molecule is.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** All right, because then you can test the quantity of transferrin as well.

## Ferritin, Chelation, and Historical Context

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an article on the NIH website related to COVID outcomes. They found a statistical correlation between high ferritin levels and poor outcomes. They were suggesting iron chelation to lower ferritin levels to mitigate serious outcomes. What do you say about ferritin levels and chelation as a method of helping people with known high ferritin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several people have been talking about protecting against disease, and now the coronavirus, by chelating iron. Going back decades, people realized that free iron is associated with infections—parasites, fungus, bacteria, viruses—and cancer. Cancer acts like an invading pathogen in its hunger for iron. Things that want to grow fast need a supply of available iron.

Ferritin should basically be an intracellular storage form that is invisible to anything in the blood. But as you get stressed and overloaded, it starts leaking out of the cells. Just looking at your blood level, you can't really tell what your stored iron is because inflammation makes the iron leak out. Both transferrin and ferritin in your blood increase during inflammation. So, as you experience inflammation, your blood iron rises apart from the real level inside your cells.

Fifty years ago, doctors were diagnosing iron deficiency based on low hemoglobin and hematocrit and prescribing iron to a high proportion of female patients. It was an Anglo-American custom going back to the 19th century regarding "chlorosis" or "green sickness."

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Was that from too much iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The diagnosis was that because their blood was low in hemoglobin, it was a "weakness typical of young women" that made them look green. The green was likely a combination of poorly oxygenated blood giving a blue tint, combined with yellow bilirubin from the breakdown of red blood cells. It was likely a sluggish liver and low thyroid being unable to get rid of bilirubin.

Arsenic was commonly used to treat it because irritation stimulates the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. In the 1920s, when arsenic was discarded, they kept the same process of stimulating bone marrow using high doses of iron—sometimes horribly high doses of intravenous or intramuscular iron.

**Andrew Murray:** Probably causing massive damage and driving up cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I knew women who had black marks all over their legs from injected iron.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding ferritin, if someone has a level of 800—twice the upper limit—what would you think about iron chelators like deferoxamine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago, I was interested in deferoxamine. Just as I started thinking about using it, I read that it could move the iron into worse places and lead to cancer. I'm a little skeptical about what kind of chelator is used.

**Andrew Murray:** So it wouldn't bind it up for excretion; it would shunt it somewhere else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens with a lot of chelation. When they think they're chelating mercury, lead, or cadmium out of the bone where it was sitting passively, they often move it into the kidneys and brain.

## Coffee as a Safe Chelator

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know of any safe chelators?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee is the only one I feel safe with. It has been shown to reduce the bound heavy metals in kidneys and other crucial organs, especially the liver. Many studies show that coffee drinkers have low ALT, an indicator of liver stress. Heavy coffee drinkers have an extremely low incidence of all kinds of liver diseases, including liver cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Haven't you said also that calcium and eggshell is a good chelator of heavy metals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a very indirect way. When you analyze the minerals in arteries, kidneys, and brains where you shouldn't have calcium crystals, they find iron and other heavy metals associated with them. This association occurred in calcium-deficient areas. When you are deficient in calcium, you load up on whatever "junk metal" happens to be around.

The reason is that a stressed tissue shifts from oxidative metabolism (producing carbon dioxide) to glycolytic production of lactic acid. When a cell produces lactic acid, it leaves a slightly alkaline shift inside the cell, ionizing the cells and making them retain both calcium and any positively charged metals like iron and aluminum.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What foods are high in iron that we should limit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It matters how much calcium they have, too. If you aren't getting enough calcium to turn off your parathyroid hormone and keep your metabolism towards carbon dioxide, you're going to retain more iron. Meat, and liver in particular, has very low calcium and very high iron. It's extremely important to have coffee when you're eating those to block the iron absorption. Vitamin D also helps avoid iron retention by lowering parathyroid hormone.

## Caller: Fulvic Minerals

**Andrew Murray:** We have a question from a caller asking if fulvates or fulvic minerals would be good for binding iron.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they would probably hold it in your intestine to some extent, the way they bind minerals in the soil.

**Andrew Murray:** So if you ate contaminated food, it might hold it, but it wouldn't necessarily pull it out of the rest of your body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen research on that, but it's a possibility. However, if you have a lot of stomach acid, the acid might release minerals associated with what you took in.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I know it's not a good idea to eat clay regularly because it has a lot of iron in it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, when it hits your stomach, there is a slight dissolution of the clay substance.

## Mechanisms of Detoxification

**Andrew Murray:** Just to wrap up chelation: you don't recommend standard chelators because they pull metals from safe stores into circulation, but coffee has an excretory ability?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Also, when we make acids like citric acid or succinic acid inside our cells, if we make enough that some moves into the bloodstream, that is known to carry aluminum and iron out of the cell into the bloodstream. But if you *eat* those acids, they will pick up heavy metals in your intestine and carry them *into* your body. Our body creates a stream of chelators which are constantly tending to pull cadmium and aluminum out.

**Andrew Murray:** Would it be okay to take capsules of ground coffee or instant coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure, capsules of instant coffee, for example.

## Caller: Low Hematocrit vs. Iron Levels

**Caller (Eureka):** I'm calling on behalf of my husband. We are regular blood donors. In the last year, he has failed the hematocrit test consistently at the blood center where they take it out of the fingertip. However, when he does a regular lab test from his elbow, he is fine. We've tried iron supplements and Vitamin C, but he still fails the finger prick test.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Capillary hematocrit is not the same as arterial or general system hematocrit. You have to figure out what's going on with the difference between the two.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So his hematocrit is low at the fingertip, but normal in the venous blood.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is important to look at things other than hematocrit. If you are under stress and have an elevated estrogen-to-progesterone ratio, estrogen lowers hepcidin. If estrogen is up, you are retaining iron at the same time that you are lowering your hematocrit. This is the same thing that was happening 100 years ago; women looked anemic but were being poisoned with too much iron. That can happen to men too.

## Caller: Supplements for Iron Detox

**Caller (New Mexico):** Can niacinamide, aspirin, or lithium detox iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin is known to be very protective against iron. That was established 30 or 40 years ago. It acts as an antioxidant and maybe as an iron binder. It is probably one of the most protective things next to coffee and Vitamin E for preventing the toxicity of iron.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about niacinamide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does all kinds of defensive things to maintain your cell's oxidative capacity. It is the failure of oxidative energy production that makes iron become so toxic. So, niacinamide and aspirin are extremely good bets.

**Andrew Murray:** What about lithium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it can have some adverse effects on your iron system.

## Caller: Chelated Vitamins and Inflammation

**Caller:** I have extreme inflammation. My doctor has me on medicines and vitamins that are "chelated." Is chelation bad or good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think "chelated vitamins" is just a marketing ploy. The way vitamins and minerals exist in food is the safest. If you associate them with other chemicals, there hasn't been enough study to know if they are safe compared to getting them naturally from foods.

**Caller:** I'm allergic to everything. Is there anything I could take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over the years, I've seen lots of chronic, mysterious ailments clear up as soon as the person stopped all of their supplements for a week or so.

## Caller: Adverse Vaccine Reaction

**Caller:** I got the COVID shot 10 days ago. On the eighth day, my arm blew up like a balloon with a rash. Now, the blood seems to be pooling at the ends of my fingers and toes—they are blue and red, and my palms are blotchy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The vaccine creates inflammation. The most dangerous part is that this type of inflammation produces a tendency toward hypercoagulation. When you have areas that aren't circulating fully, there is a tendency to form fibrin layers or clotting material inside the blood vessel. This relates to the "blood sludging" phenomenon.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What would you recommend she use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin, cyproheptadine, milk, and Vitamin D. Serotonin is one of the things that goes crazy under the inflammation of both COVID and the vaccine.

## Blood Sludging and Rouleaux Formation

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, could you sum up the "rouleaux" formation—where red cells stack up on each other—that has been seen in the blood of people after receiving the vaccine? How does that relate to the coagulopathies, strokes, and myocarditis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Melvin Knisely was a person who studied the "blood sludging" phenomenon in people who were under stress and deteriorating quickly. He saw it as a lack of metabolic energy. People following up on his work emphasized that what was happening was catalyzed fibrin polymerization, creating a layer or blockade film of fibrin inside the blood vessels. This thickens the capillary wall, making it hard for oxygen to get through, and coats red blood cells with a layer of fibrin.

People working with very good microscopes studied these coin-like rolls of red blood cells (rouleaux). When they pulled them apart with microprobes, they would snap back together. They published images showing filaments—assumed to be fibrin polymers—stretched between the red blood cells like rubber bands. That was brought on basically by a reduction in oxidative metabolism and a shift to lactic acid metabolism. That is where you start having iron problems and inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people's blood could be clumping like that just under a stressful situation, not necessarily just from COVID or the shots.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's an apparently universal thing that happens when you're in very bad condition.

## Closing and Aspirin Safety

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wanted to mention regarding aspirin: it is only safe to use more than a baby aspirin a day if you are taking Vitamin K. Thorne Research makes a Vitamin K2. For every aspirin (325mg) you take, you need 1 milligram (1000 micrograms) of Vitamin K2 to keep yourself from bleeding excessively.

**Station DJ:** Could you mention natural food sources of K2?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Kale is king, but it may not be in high enough doses if you want to use aspirin to block inflammation in doses of 1 to 3 grams a day. If you take a baby aspirin (90mg), you don't need the supplement. But for high doses, it's not safe unless you have Vitamin K2.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you for listening. Good night.
