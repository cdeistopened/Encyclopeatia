## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have perhaps never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions. We manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

Tonight, we are continuing our topic on the thyroid, its role in health, and the use of coconut oil as a means of weight loss and improved thyroid function.

To carry on from last month's exposé on the polyunsaturated versus saturated fat controversy, I wanted to mention right from the get-go that some of this material has been copied from Dr. Raymond Peat. This material is not something that we have produced, although in between the excerpts, the commentary is ours.

I want to continue this exposé of a fairly startling turnaround. Many people believe that polyunsaturated fats are good and saturated fats are bad, but it is seemingly very much the other way around. Our ancestors and grandparents had it right the first time: eating lots of saturated fat, animal fats, butter, milk, cream, and dairy products. They were very healthy and had very low incidences of cancer, diabetes, and obesity—things which have shot up since the 1920s.

## The History of Seed Oils vs. Saturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** At the end of the Second World War, the seed oil industry was in a crisis. The traditional use of seed oils, such as flaxseed oil in paints and plastics, was being displaced by new compounds made from petroleum. The industry needed new markets. They discovered ways to convince the public that seed oils were better than animal fats, calling their seed oils "heart protective," even though human studies soon showed the same results that animal studies had: they were toxic to the heart and increased the incidence of cancer.

This began in the 1920s and 1930s with experiments on animals in feedlots. Farmers wanted to increase the animals' weight in the last six or eight weeks of life to make them more valuable. They started using coconut oil, a cheap, imported tropical saturated fat. They believed it would be a good feed source to increase weight gain. Lo and behold, rather than gaining weight, the animals actually lost weight.

So, they changed their plans. They switched from coconut oil to corn oil and soy oil. When they did that, the animals started gaining weight. However, the long-term effects of these fats were toxic. The animals were unable to continue eating this for more than six or eight weeks before they started getting serious, life-threatening inflammatory disorders.

Ultimately, coconut oil was thrown out, and a huge campaign was started to alert the American public that these cheap, tropical imported oils were not good for you. They claimed the alternatives should be USA-grown corn and soy. With the chemical and pharmaceutical industry behind this, corn and soy became very important crops to be genetically engineered and owned.

Rapidly, the information was disseminated that soy and corn were good for you—that they were polyunsaturated, good for your heart, and good for cholesterol. The propaganda was promoted by a lot of money.

## The Lipid Hypothesis

**Andrew Murray:** Despite the widespread acceptance, the lipid hypothesis has never really been proven. Oil researcher Mary Enig, Ph.D., and Sally Fallon, founder of the Weston A. Price Foundation, point out in their article "The Secrets of the Edible Oil Industry" that the lipid theory was first proposed by David Kritchevsky. In 1954, he published a paper describing the effects of feeding cholesterol to rabbits.

By showing that polyunsaturated oils from vegetable sources lowered serum cholesterol temporarily in humans, Kritchevsky appeared to show that the findings from animal trials were relevant to heart disease. Soon, the United States was on an anti-cholesterol campaign.

In 1956, an American Heart Association fundraiser was shown on TV. Panelists presented the lipid hypothesis as the cause of America's heart disease epidemic and recommended a "prudent diet" in which corn oil, margarine, and chicken replaced butter, lard, beef, and eggs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But the panel was not unanimous. Dr. Paul Dudley White disagreed with his AHA colleagues. He noted that heart disease in the form of myocardial infarction (MI) was non-existent in 1900, when egg consumption was three times what it was in 1956 and when corn oil was completely unavailable. When pressed to support the prudent diet, Dr. White replied, "See here, I began my practice as a cardiologist in 1921 and I never saw an MI patient until 1928. Back in the MI-free days before 1920, the fats were butter and lard. And I think we would all benefit from the kind of diet we had at that time when no one had ever heard the words corn oil."

Unfortunately, his observations fell on deaf ears. Ads in the Journal of the American Medical Association described Wesson oil as a "cholesterol depressant." Mazola advertisements claimed that "science finds corn oil important to your health." Dr. Frederick Stare, head of Harvard University's nutrition department, wrote a syndicated column encouraging the consumption of up to a cup of corn oil per day.

## Essential Fatty Acids and Health Risks

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Meanwhile, experimenters found that feeding a diet that totally lacked the "essential" fatty acids produced animals with remarkable properties. According to Dr. Ray Peat, they consumed oxygen and calories at a very high rate. Their mitochondria were unusually tough and stable. Their tissues could be transplanted into other animals without provoking immunological rejection. They were very hard to kill by trauma and toxins that easily provoked lethal shock in animals on the usual polyunsaturated oil diet. As German researchers had seen in 1927, they had a low susceptibility to cancer.

Dr. Mary Enig points out that other researchers conducted population studies showing that the animal model used by Kritchevsky—especially using vegetarian animals like rabbits—was not a valid approach to heart disease in human omnivores. She cites studies showing that arterial plaque is a natural process unrelated to diet. American soldiers killed during the Korean War had similar amounts of plaque (75%) as Japanese natives (65%) whose diet was lower in animal products.

In 1957, Dr. Norman Jolliffe launched an "Anti-Coronary Club." All were placed on the prudent diet. Results published in 1966 showed that those on the prudent diet of corn oil, margarine, fish, chicken, and cold cereal had an average serum cholesterol 30 points lower than the control group. However, eight prudent diet followers died of heart disease, while *none* of those who ate meat three times a day died. Jolliffe himself died in 1961 from a vascular thrombosis.

In the 1960s, interest in organ transplantation led to the discovery that polyunsaturated fats prolong graft survival by suppressing the immune system. Immunosuppression was considered to have a role in the carcinogenicity of essential fatty acids.

**Andrew Murray:** Just to reiterate: polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) suppress the immune system.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yes. Around the same time, studies showed that unsaturated fats retarded brain development and produced obesity. In addition, the age-related glycation products usually blamed on sugar are largely the result of peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**Andrew Murray:** That is one of the important things about PUFAs. Because they are polyunsaturated, they are very susceptible to lipid peroxidation—oxidation of the molecule—because they are not stable. Unlike saturated fats, which are completely saturated and very stable.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And they don't go rancid quickly. Coconut oil has a very long shelf life.

By 1980, it looked as though researchers would see the promotion of cancer, heart disease, mitochondrial damage, hypothyroidism, and immune suppression caused by these fats as their most important feature. But then, fat researchers just started changing the subject.

Dr. Ray Peat advises us to get acquainted with pasture-fed butter, lard, tallow, and coconut oil. Throw away the canola, corn, sunflower, safflower, sesame, and soy oils. Stay away from anything containing polyunsaturated fats. Kiss tofu goodbye and forget soy milk, soy yogurt, and soy protein.

**Andrew Murray:** Animals that eat polyunsaturated fats don't produce saturated fat. When you eat their meat, you are eating polyunsaturated fat with all the adverse effects of soy and corn oil.

## Thyroid Health and Diagnosis

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to the thyroid. In 1995, researchers studied over 25,000 participants at a Colorado health fair. They discovered that among patients not taking thyroid medication, 10% had a thyroid problem that had gone unrecognized. These figures suggest that nationally, there may be as many as 13 million Americans with an undiagnosed thyroid problem.

Endocrinologist Kenneth Blanchard notes that the TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) test is often viewed as a yes-or-no answer, which is fundamentally wrong. TSH is controlled not just by circulating T4 and T3, but by T4 getting converted to T3 at the pituitary level. Excess T3 generated at the pituitary can falsely suppress TSH. Hence, many people who test within the "normal" range are actually suffering from thyroid problems.

Dr. Ridha Arem, author of *The Thyroid Solution*, agrees that hypothyroidism may exist despite normal TSH levels. If we included people with low-grade hypothyroidism, the number would likely double.

Diet plays a major role. We know low iodine leads to goiter, but iodized salt hasn't been the answer. There are foods known as goitrogens that block iodine. Two prevalent ones in the American diet are peanuts (and peanut butter) and soybeans (often used as Textured Vegetable Protein or TVP).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Everyone could benefit from eating coconut oil. It helps improve your metabolism. A real low-fat diet can be very detrimental.

Something you can do at home to assess your thyroid function is to take your temperature. A normal body temperature is 98.0 to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. You can use a basal body thermometer to take your temperature before and after breakfast, and before and after lunch. You should also check your pulse, which should be around 70 to 85 beats per minute. If these are low, it may indicate hypothyroidism, though it is best to work with a practitioner.

**Andrew Murray:** Here are some questions to ask yourself. If you answer yes to many of these, you may want to investigate your thyroid health:
*   Have you experienced infertility or miscarriage?
*   Do you feel like you catch every infection, or take a long time to recover?
*   Do you regularly eat significant amounts of uncooked goitrogenic foods such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, rutabaga, turnips, radishes, cauliflower, millet, cabbage, or kale?
*   Are you experiencing menstrual cycle changes (too short/long, or heavy/light flow)?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Regarding the goitrogenic foods—plants in the Brassica family like broccoli and kale are meant to be cooked. If you cook them until they are soft, you take away the potential for them to cause a goiter. We aren't suggesting you don't eat them, just don't eat them raw.

Also, many dietary polyunsaturated oils negatively affect thyroid health. It is possible they are among the worst offenders. Even as little as one teaspoon a day can be suppressive.

## Caller: Food vs. Food-Like Products

**Caller 1:** I make a distinction in my life between food and "food-like production." When I'm out, I try to educate people to steer away from food-like products.

**Andrew Murray:** Yes, education is what it's all about.

**Caller 1:** When restaurants ask if I want ketchup or jam, I ask if they know it has high fructose corn syrup. Just little spots of education here and there.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well done. Keep up the good work.

**Andrew Murray:** High fructose corn syrup has become the common sweetener. It is no longer sugar or honey because those are too expensive.

## Caller: Omega-3 vs. Omega-6 Ratios

**Caller 2:** You have neglected to discuss the issue regarding Omega-6 and Omega-3 fats and the ratios. I wanted to recommend a book called *The Omega Diet* by Artemis Simopoulos. As I understand it, there is evidence that the ratio makes a big difference. The most affordable oil high in Omega-3 is canola, but also flax and walnut oil. I wanted your feedback.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This brings up the question of "Essential Fatty Acids" (EFAs). Aren't some polyunsaturated fatty acids essential?

Dr. Ray Peat has asked prominent oil researchers for evidence that there is such a thing as an essential fatty acid. One professor cited a single publication about a single patient. Others cited the Burr and Burr study from 1929. It is surprising that people consider research from 1929 definitive. What was known about nutrition then? Most B vitamins weren't even suspected to exist. Burr had no way of understanding what deficiencies or toxicities were present in his experimental diet.

Two years before Burr's experiment, German researchers found that a fat-free diet prevented almost all spontaneous cancers in rats. Later work showed that polyunsaturated fats both promote and initiate cancer.

Logically, look at how we got here. Did our ancestors eat bottles of essential fatty acids or canola oil? No. They ate butter, coconut, and olive oil.

**Andrew Murray:** And how much fish were they eating? Probably not that much unless they lived on the coast.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Exactly. Let's get back to basics.

## Caller: Hypothyroid Symptoms & Iodine

**Caller 3:** I have a basal temperature of 96.8 consistently. I have a number of symptoms of hypothyroidism. I painted iodine on my skin and it disappeared within 12 hours. Do you think I should get a prescription for Armour Thyroid?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The best thing is to talk to a doctor who is open-minded about thyroid issues, such as Dr. Connie Basch or Dr. Beverly Copeland. Alternatively, you can buy glandular thyroid extracts. However, I recommend working with a practitioner because taking too much is not safe. Diet is the first place to start.

**Andrew Murray:** And stop eating thyroid-suppressive foods.

**Caller 3:** I'll avoid the polyunsaturated oils. I'm thinking of eating seaweed for the thyroid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Be careful. A deficiency of iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, but too much iodine can also suppress the thyroid. It is a delicate balance.

## Caller: High Cholesterol

**Caller 4:** My sister's cholesterol is 280. She asked what she can do naturally. I told her to eat the right oils. Can you distill some advice for her?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Cholesterol is often raised because of too much sugar and carbohydrates in the diet. When you say "good oils," remember that heart attacks were unknown before 1920 when people ate butter, lard, and coconut oil.

I recommend organic butter, organic coconut oil, and a small amount of olive oil. Decreasing grains and sugars would be a healthy place to start. Sugars get converted into fat and can raise cholesterol levels.

Also, recent research suggests that people over the age of 50 with cholesterol around 230 were less likely to die of heart attacks and cancer than those with cholesterol below 200. Cholesterol has a protective function in the body.

**Caller 4:** What about plaque buildup?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is now being attributed more to an increase of sugars and polyunsaturated oils (trans fatty acids). Corn oil in large quantities has been shown to suppress the immune system.

## Caller: Soy Milk for Children

**Caller 5:** I have two kids. I don't buy high fructose corn syrup, but I give them chocolate soy milk because my son eats so much dairy and I wanted to balance it out.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Soy has a goitrogenic effect. The soy flavonoids are thyroid suppressive. A study showed that 11 ounces of soy milk a day in a healthy individual is enough to suppress thyroid function.

**Caller 5:** Wow.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My advice is to feed your children the least processed foods. Make your own chocolate milk using regular milk and cocoa.

**Caller 5:** I can do that. I found my 2-year-old prefers eating stuff straight from the garden.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is how it is supposed to be.

## Caller: Medication Advice

**Caller 6:** I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism four weeks ago. I'm on a small dose of Levoxyl. I eat a clean diet, but I drink almond milk and eat peanut butter and almond butter.

**Andrew Murray:** Bad. You should cut those out of your diet now.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Since you are on medication, my advice is to ask your doctor to switch you to Armour Thyroid, Nature-Throid, or Westhroid. These are natural porcine glandulars that contain both T3 and T4. Levoxyl is just T4, which relies on your liver to convert it to the active form (T3). The natural glandulars are often a better alternative.

## Caller: Tempeh and Weight Loss

**Caller 7:** What do you think of tempeh? It's a fermented soy product.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I don't think it is as harmful as other soy products because fermentation makes grains and beans more digestible. However, for someone who is hypothyroid, my advice is do not eat anything that could possibly suppress your thyroid.

**Caller 7:** I also want to comment that I started eating coconut oil three or four years ago and lost about 20 pounds.

**Andrew Murray:** Absolutely. It is a thermogenic product. It increases your body's metabolism and oxygen consumption. Your thyroid governs every metabolic process, including heat production. Coconut oil is a saturated fat that supports your thyroid and allows you to lose fat while eating fat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In the 1940s, when they experimented with animals, they found the animals lost weight on coconut oil. The American Soy Association boycotted imported oils to sell their corn and soy oil. That is why we haven't heard this research until recently.

## Conclusion: Soy Dangers and Animal Studies

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Today, it is nearly impossible to eat at restaurants or buy packaged foods that don't have soy oil.

Dr. Ray Peat writes that the sudden surge of polyunsaturated oils into the food chain post-World War II has caused many changes in hormones. The best-understood effect is interference with the thyroid gland. Unsaturated oils block thyroid hormone secretion, its movement in the circulatory system, and the response of tissue to the hormone.

There is a growing body of research concerning soy's detrimental effect. In the 1960s, when soy was introduced into infant formulas, babies started developing goiters. A study by Fort *et al.* showed that teenage children with autoimmune thyroid disease were significantly more likely to have received soy formula as infants (31%) compared to healthy siblings (12%) or controls (13%).

Another study by Ishizuki *et al.* showed that when healthy adults were fed 30 grams of pickled soybeans per day for one month, they developed goiters and elevated TSH levels. One month after stopping, levels returned to normal.

Traditionally, soybean oil has been used for livestock feed because it causes animals to gain weight. Dr. Peat notes that the fattening effect is due to the presence of long-chain fatty acids like linoleic and linolenic acid, which have an anti-thyroid effect. The animal's fat becomes chemically similar to the fats in their food, causing it to be equally toxic and fattening to the consumer.
