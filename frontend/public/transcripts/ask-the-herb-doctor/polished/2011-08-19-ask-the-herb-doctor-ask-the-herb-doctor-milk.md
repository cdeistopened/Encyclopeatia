## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our show, we run the third Friday of each month. Sarah and I are both licensed medical herbalists. We graduated in England with a degree in herbal medicine and we run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

Tonight, Dr. Raymond Peat has been kind enough to join us again. We had a listener from Rio de Janeiro who has been tuning in regularly on the web. She had plenty of questions about milk consumption, specifically regarding arguments against milk raised in a seminar by Pedro Bastos, who advocates the Paleo diet.

Dr. Peat, thank you for joining the show again. Would you introduce yourself and give a rundown of your professional academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied physiology in the Biology Department at the University of Oregon. I've been interested in endocrine biology and many other themes in biology since I was a child, but I didn't study it academically until 1968 to 1972 because I had a bad opinion of American biology from my high school experience. I have read many other national traditions in biology, so I take a critical approach to most of the things that I read.

## Milk, IGF, and Cancer Risks

**Andrew Murray:** The reason for tonight's show is to address some erroneous science suggesting inherent problems with using milk. Pedro Bastos mentioned that Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) was stimulated strongly by milk. What do you have to say about IGF and its stimulation by milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has some of the features of insulin, but it and insulin are just two of our regulatory factors. When one of them is slightly distorted, we have so many other regulatory systems that nothing really changes much.

**Andrew Murray:** So you're saying there is no significant negative effect from the stimulation of IGF by milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at the functions in a given species, animals that are very big for their species have a high level of IGF. However, big mice have high levels, while elephants have very low levels. So, within a species, it has one kind of effect, but across the spectrum of animal species, it has a very different meaning. It is just part of a system.

Our whole system has long-range adaptive processes. Nutrition research has hardly scratched the surface of how nutrition works in developmental biology. Most nutrition research is done for the agricultural food industry—they want to know how to make big animals, not intelligent, long-lived animals. Some studies have found that your grandmother's nutritional level affects the development of your brain. In animal studies, you can see the influence of diet going on for four to five generations. Focusing on the size of the brain, for example, you can't determine anything in just one generation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when Pedro Bastos says milk is bad because it stimulates IGF, is that a theory not backed by evidence?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is not really enough science to know. It might turn out four or five generations from now that it is either good or bad. For example, people who drink milk might have great-grandchildren who are much smarter than they are.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** He claims it is a stimulator of cancer, but isn't it also a stimulator of healthy tissue growth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For example, a study of radiation effects in Japan looked at all factors of life and diet. They saw that people who didn't drink milk had a much higher risk of becoming demented in old age. A later study in the U.S. saw the same thing—that milk has anti-dementia properties.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there an anti-inflammatory component to it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They don't really know; that is just an association of big populations. But it could involve something like IGF. There are so many factors in milk. The high ratio of calcium to phosphorus is one of the extremely beneficial qualities of milk.

## Calcium Absorption and Bone Health

**Andrew Murray:** You are very big on calcium. Perhaps we can discuss how easily bioavailable the calcium in milk is compared to other foods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The next best food, which people don't usually think of as food, is eggshell. I had a relative who cured his early youthful osteoporosis by having a tablespoon of powdered eggshell every day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That would be about 5,000 milligrams of calcium a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something like that. That is in the neighborhood of what the Maasai people get during their lifetime—5,000 to 7,000 milligrams on average. A whole eggshell is maybe 2,000 milligrams of calcium carbonate.

However, the absorption of calcium in milk is greatly improved by the presence of lactose. When you compare different sugars, fructose is not as good as lactose, but it is still an important factor in helping to absorb calcium. Starch has a very poor effect on calcium absorption. When bone development was compared in rats made deficient in Vitamin D, one group was given starch as its carbohydrate, and the other was given sucrose. Despite being deficient in Vitamin D, the sucrose-fed rats had strong bones.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So sugar doesn't weaken your bones like we're told?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it actually works parallel to thyroid and Vitamin D for stimulating metabolism. Calcium, the T3 component of the thyroid hormone, and fructose all have overlapping effects in activating respiratory metabolism.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people who drink lactose-free milk will not be absorbing as much calcium as people who drink normal milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right.

## Lactose Intolerance

**Andrew Murray:** What about people who say they are lactose intolerant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies in Chinatown in San Francisco compared people who hadn't grown up drinking milk to people who had—same family, same genes. It is a matter of what you grow up exposed to. When you take someone who has grown up without it and have them drink a total of a glass and a half of milk a day—about half a glass at a time—in just two or three weeks, they induce the enzymes in their intestine.

When you look at factors responsible for losing those enzymes, a deficiency of progesterone and thyroid, or a bacterial infection of the small intestine, will cause the loss of those enzymes.

**Andrew Murray:** So a bacterial infection can directly cause a lack of enzyme production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and that usually develops in the upper part of the small intestine in people who are thyroid deficient. Starch tends to support that bacterial overgrowth more than fruit sugar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I found that once people get their overall nutrition in a better state, it becomes easier for them to digest milk.

## Calcium, Arteries, and Inflammation

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can we talk about the anti-inflammatory effects of calcium? When we think of calcium, we usually just think of bones.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Adelle Davis talked about this in the 1950s. People think of calcifying kidneys and arteries and are afraid of the calcium in milk. But she pointed out research showing that people who have the least calcium in their diet have the most kidney stones and the most calcified arteries. That is because of the anti-inflammatory effect of calcium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the extra calcium deposited in the arteries is coming from the bones in response to a deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The calcium in your diet, by having an anti-inflammatory and pro-thyroid effect, tends to direct the deposition of calcium into your bones. It keeps the production of carbon dioxide up by stimulating cell metabolism. The same carbon dioxide that deposits calcium into the bones prevents calcium from depositing in arteries and kidneys by keeping it in a soluble state.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you take enough in your diet, it goes from the milk to the bone. If you don't, it goes from the bone to your arteries.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the factors in osteoporosis is high cortisol or high prolactin. Both of those are caused by high serotonin. Serotonin, prolactin, and cortisol are all anti-bone formation. Calcium in your diet suppresses prolactin, cortisol, and serotonin, allowing the bone-building factors to be dominant.

## Sugar, CO2, and Metabolism

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Let's talk about how the sugar in milk helps your liver function better to manufacture more carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any sugar helps. If you eat sucrose, it is similar to lactose, though not quite as effective for absorbing calcium. Sucrose in fruit, honey, or plain sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. It takes a little fructose to catalyze the more energetic burning of glucose to produce carbon dioxide. You don't have to eat a pure sugar diet to have optimal carbon dioxide production, but it is okay to avoid starch entirely.

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of keeping CO2 up, I know you've mentioned bag breathing to re-inspire expired air.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something as simple as baking soda stimulates bone formation. The mechanism is carbon dioxide. The body has such an affinity for carbon dioxide that even though there is a high concentration inside your body compared to the atmosphere, if you put your arm or leg into a bag of carbon dioxide, it will flow into your body. The same applies to carbonated hot springs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why for broken bone treatment, they use CO2 treatment where you put your broken limb into a bag filled with carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you move to a high altitude or live in a submarine, your bones incorporate some of the CO2 out of your blood. People living at very high altitudes, once adapted, have blood coming out of their lungs that is more completely oxygenated. The effect of carbon dioxide improves the diffusion of gas from the air into the blood capillaries in the lungs.

## The Paleo Diet and Human History

**Andrew Murray:** Some argue that as a human race, we've been around for millions of years and only recently started drinking milk. What do you say to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of people have an imaginary history of the human race. Konrad Lorenz and his followers described the evolution of the "killer ape"—that a carnivorous ape made the transition into humankind, so meat was the basis of human evolution. Others say Africans living along coasts ate fish, so the brain is made of fish oil. But all of that is reading backwards into history from whatever people believe in the present.

**Andrew Murray:** Grains would also have been a fairly recent food.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, for the last 10,000 or 20,000 years civilizations have domesticated grains. Grain eating hasn't done anything great for the human brain or general health. So, insofar as the "Caveman diet" takes people away from a grain-based diet, it starts in the right direction. However, one of the bad features of the grains-and-nuts diet is a high phosphate content.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And a high meat diet also has high phosphate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a high meat diet has that same drawback unless you eat eggshells or chew on the bones.

## Grass-Fed vs. Grain-Fed Milk

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Does this bring up grass-fed milk versus grain-fed milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Fresh grass has a high ratio of Vitamin E to fatty acids. In grains, especially if stored, Vitamin E is depleted. Cows need Vitamin E in proportion to fatty acids because the bacteria in the cow's rumen destroy the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in plant material. The bacteria hydrogenate those PUFAs so that 98% of the polyunsaturated fat is destroyed—*if* the cow has enough Vitamin E.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So fresh grass has more Vitamin E than grain and alfalfa.

**Andrew Murray:** What about organic milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. In the 1960s, Israel had one of the highest rates of breast cancer. They noticed their dairies were using Lindane. As soon as they banned the use of that pesticide, their breast cancer rate came down to the European and U.S. level.

## Estrogen in Milk

**Andrew Murray:** What is the truth regarding the presence of estrogens in milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The amount in milk is maybe up to 1 microgram per quart. Estrogen is really as much a male hormone as a female one. Natural estrogen is processed in both men and women and detoxified fairly quickly. About 85% of the estrogen in milk is attached to either sulfate or glucuronic acid, which prepares it to be excreted by the kidneys. A birth control pill has 30 micrograms. No one drinks 30 liters of milk in a day.

## Homogenization and Raw Milk

**Andrew Murray:** What about homogenization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pressure breaks the particle of fat up into such a small size that it doesn't separate. Presumably, that makes unstable fats oxidize faster, so it has a small harmful effect. But considering the alternatives in a supermarket, other foods are going to be much more dangerous as oxidants.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've heard the theory that homogenization breaks the fat molecule so small it blocks arteries. Is that rubbish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When we secrete bile, the soapy material in the bile breaks up all the fats we eat into particles of about that same size, which do get directly into the bloodstream. That is the chylomicron system.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So would you consider raw milk nutritionally superior?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. It is nutritionally better. But that doesn't mean you should eat soybeans or bread if you can't get raw milk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It also depends on what the cows are eating.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you get milk from a dairy with only a few cows, what the cow ate the preceding day has a big effect on taste and allergenicity. If you pool milk from a thousand cows, it becomes a standardized product. Also, most milk has at least 20 times as much progesterone as estrogen. If you did get some active estrogen, the progesterone is more than enough to counteract its effect.

## Goat Milk

**Caller:** I would like to address the nutritional value of goat milk and fresh goat cheese. I feel like it's less mucus-forming.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The composition is definitely different, but again, it depends on what the goat was eating. When I was a child, a neighbor came back from the war with malaria. As soon as he was able to drink his daily goat milk, he didn't have malaria attacks. Once, when he was in the veterans' hospital for a checkup, he had an attack, they wouldn't let him get his goat milk, and he died.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've heard goat milk protein is smaller and more easily digestible.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard that quite a bit. There are so many chemical differences I wouldn't guess what was most important.

## Alternatives to Milk

**Andrew Murray:** If people refuse to drink milk or take eggshells, what else can they do to get sufficient calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you eat most of your carbohydrate as fruit and avoid grains to avoid excess phosphate, then probably an eggshell a day will give you all the calcium you need.

**Andrew Murray:** But if they refuse eggshells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suppose a leaf-based diet would eventually provide enough calcium. However, in an experiment where rats were given fresh vegetables versus canned vegetables, the ones getting canned vegetables lived perfectly well, while the others wasted away because they couldn't assimilate the nutrients. The vegetables need to be well-cooked.

## Food Additives and Carrageenan

**Caller:** I have a question regarding evaporated milk and thickening agents like carrageenan.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have an article on my website about carrageenan. A few years ago, I started getting sick on cream from an organic producer and saw they were using carrageenan. The same happened with ice cream. Many cheeses add gums as carriers for flavoring agents. One researcher has demonstrated in animal experiments that carrageenan is carcinogenic. The FDA allows it because they say only "degraded" carrageenan is carcinogenic, but bacteria in your intestine degrade it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And evaporated milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is heavily oxidized, which is why it tastes bad.

## Sprouted Grains and Sourdough

**Caller:** My question is about sprouted grain breads and sourdough breads.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just the soaking process activates enzymes in the dough. 8 to 12 hours of being moistened allows enzymes to break down phytic acid into inositol and phosphate. Gluten is also partly broken down. The protein quality actually increases because gluten carries many nitrogen-rich amino acids which make it allergenic. When enzymes release the nitrogen, it can be used to make new, different proteins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people eating a lot of grains get a lot of phosphorus, similar to people eating a lot of meat. Both are out of balance regarding calcium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Americans often have a 7-to-1 phosphate-to-calcium ratio. Milk is about 1.3-to-1 in favor of calcium. The long-range optimum is probably between 1-to-1 and 2-to-1 in favor of calcium.

## Raw Milk Politics

**Caller:** I want to bring up the issue of raw milk availability and government interference.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone should have their own cow next door. My father built a barn that looked like a little cottage, so it made the neighborhood look residential, not like a farm.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You mentioned earlier that pro-pasteurization support comes from the NIH and SAIC.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, one of the articles warning about dangerous estrogen in milk was done by a partnership of the NIH and SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation). They are effectively a branch of the defense and surveillance industry.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Why are they pro-pasteurization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is motivated by a kind of class war to make food cheaper. In the 1930s, there was a campaign against breastfeeding and advocating early feeding of beans and bread. They are doing that again in poor communities. They don't want people on food stamps buying "fancy" food like milk, meat, and eggs.

## Yogurt vs. Milk

**Caller:** Would the phosphorus and calcium effect be more wholesome if taken as yogurt?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Normal American yogurt retains the lactic acid-rich whey. Strained Greek yogurt (like Fage) removes the whey and the lactic acid. It is not good to replace milk with tart yogurt because of the harmful effect on the liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lactic acid burdens your liver, causing a tendency toward hypoglycemia by preventing glycogen storage. Lactic acid also produces fibrosis, inflammation, and contributes to cancer metabolism.

## Serotonin

**Caller:** You usually say serotonin is bad, but I've always heard it's a "feel good" hormone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies of aggression in dogs show that when treated with SSRI drugs, their aggression subsided because their serotonin went *down*. Serotonin is a hormone of withdrawal, anxiety, and metabolic suppression. It is an emergency anti-stress hormone. When you are chronically stressed, it causes stomach ulcers, fibrosis, hardening of the arteries, and osteoporosis. Depression is actually associated with high serotonin conditions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We've been brainwashed to believe it's a feel-good hormone so drug companies could sell SSRIs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those patents are expiring, so they will be coming out with new antidepressants, and we'll stop hearing so much about serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining us, Dr. Peat. For listeners who want more information, his website is www.raypeat.com. There are plenty of scholarly articles referenced there. Good night.
