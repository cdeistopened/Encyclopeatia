## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice. You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM.

From 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in with questions related to this month's subject: California SB277, as well as the degradation of the food supply. Both are intimately linked; causal effects come from many different places and add up to a decreased quality of life for most people. We're very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show this evening. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us again. I know we went over vaccination back in June of 2014. We ran through the introduction of vaccines and mentioned that disease was already in a threefold decline before their introduction due to good food, increased sanitation, and clean water, especially in industrialized countries.

Moving on to what has been described as another bill to wipe out yet more choice, California's Bill 277 seeks to impose mandatory vaccination with no religious or ethical exemptions. This bill only came out yesterday, so it's a last-minute topic for us. We are also going to get into the degraded food chain later, but it all amounts to a decreased health perspective for most people. Would you please start by letting people know your scientific and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My PhD is from the University of Oregon in biology in 1972. I've taught in a few different institutions—State University of Mexico, Veracruz University, and two or three schools in the United States—teaching a variety of science courses, including immunology. Even though I didn't specialize in it, I learned what's going on in the immune system, and that teaching got me interested in following the development.

## Senate Bill 277 and Vaccination

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding Senate Bill 277, it abolishes most opt-outs. I think the only exemption permitted is for immunocompromised children—maybe receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppression drugs—but there will be no choice for people who don't believe the science is pointing in the right direction. Last June, we talked about studies done by the World Health Organization. Dr. Peat, why don't you bring that out again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The World Health Organization did this around 1970. They took three villages in Guatemala. They left one as a control population. To the second, they sent the regular public health team with vaccination and chlorinated water—the usual minimal public health things. To the third, they provided a nutritional supplement to all the pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and children.

Relative to the control village that didn't have any doctors or help, the health in the medically treated village got worse by several measurements. The health in the village that simply got the nutritional supplement was generally better, and the kids were bigger, healthier, and more intelligent.

**Andrew Murray:** So the World Health Organization concluded that the far cheaper and easier thing to do was to use vaccination as a standard of care?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but that isn't a popular thing with the world pharmaceutical industry because they want to sell drugs rather than food.

**Andrew Murray:** California is going to be one of only three states that have mandatory forced vaccination with no opt-outs, the others being Mississippi and West Virginia. For anyone who wants to find out more, visit [sb277.org](http://sb277.org) to see the senators involved and their funding from Merck.

In terms of the schedule, there are going to be 34 to 36 vaccines mandated by age six, and a total of 69 vaccines scheduled for a child through their teenage years. Dr. Peat, what has been shown in the scientific research regarding healthy standards of living versus vaccination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The history of looking at the relation of vaccination to disease incidence and mortality goes back more than 100 years. Ivan Illich was one of the first people to do a survey of that research. Suzanne Humphries’ website is a good introduction to that perspective. She also has information on the actual effect of the vaccine material on the baby's immune system and the need for a completely new look at what the immune system is.

There is a relatively new approach called the "danger theory," in which the body is really reacting to the disruption of its tissues. The immune system is there to repair and compensate for the injury. From this point of view, it just happens that the infectious agent gets in the way of that repair process, and it's incidental to what the immune system is doing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they could just be injecting mercury, aluminum, and other immune system irritants and get the same effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, to a great extent. Suzanne Humphries mentions a study in which they used an actual placebo control rather than a different vaccine—injecting just water versus the vaccine. They didn't see any difference in the specific infection rate for the disease the vaccine was aimed at, but they saw six or seven times greater incidence of *other* infections in the vaccinated kids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There are organizations now saying that vaccinated children are less healthy than unvaccinated children. It's hard to do a study like this because there are so many vaccinated children and not many unvaccinated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And there is not likely to be any funding to do that kind of study.

**Andrew Murray:** The companies that produce vaccines are indemnified by the government against any and all damage arising out of their use. "First, do no harm," yet you can produce a product and not be held liable when it damages someone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, do you think that unvaccinated children are at risk socializing with vaccinated children?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are cases in which a vaccinated child has spread the vaccine organism—where they use a live polio virus—and the vaccinated kid has infected unvaccinated people. But the senators getting that bill passed were claiming that the unvaccinated children are putting everyone at risk. If most of the kids are vaccinated, aren't they protected? The reasoning seems absolutely crazy. You can't put them at risk if they're protected. Apparently, the senator didn't believe that the vaccines are protecting anyone.

## The Degradation of the Food Supply: Starch

**Andrew Murray:** Let's make the link between degraded food and declining health. It is estimated that starch provides about 70 to 80% of the calories consumed by humans worldwide. Why is that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think cheapness is the main factor. Even dietitians are taught to promote a certain amount of starch. Starting in the 1930s, the US government designed and taught dietitians to promote three levels of nutrition:
1. To simply prevent starvation, emphasizing beans and cereals.
2. A middle-class, more health-oriented diet.
3. The rich person's diet with plenty of animal protein.

Originally, it was valuable to hungry people to know how to get by on a few cents a day for beans and grains. But for economic reasons, the breakfast cereal industry subsidized nutrition journals and taught dietitians to say that these things are healthful. The foods that were originally promoted just to survive are now called health foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's gone full circle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, so the rich people are now indoctrinated to eat whole grain bread.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned some pioneering work done by Gerhard Volkheimer regarding starches. Would you describe that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He rediscovered work that had been done 70 or 80 years earlier called **persorption** of particles. Ordinary digestion theory says that even proteins are broken down in the intestine and absorbed as small molecules (amino acids). Volkheimer and his predecessors showed that if you feed starch consisting of naturally formed starch grains—which can range from half the diameter of a red blood cell to about 10 times the diameter—they are much too big to pass through the smallest arterioles.

He demonstrated with people and mice that if you feed a slurry of corn starch and draw blood 15 minutes later, you can find the starch particles in the bloodstream. Later, they show up in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid. He found that it caused mice to age prematurely. When he examined the mice, he found that wherever a starch grain lodged in an arteriole or capillary, the surrounding cells would be starved of nutrients and die. It was like a shotgun working internally, killing little pockets of cells.

**Andrew Murray:** And this affects the immune system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Volkheimer was an immunologist. If big particles get into the bloodstream, they come in contact with the immune system. The simple fact that big particles are in the body means our immune system is constantly being exposed to antigens.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the foods to avoid would be grains and any starchy food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the starch is very well cooked—like boiling it for 40 to 60 minutes—and then eaten with fat, the fat slows down the absorption and allows the digestive enzymes to soften it up so it doesn't get through the intestine without being broken down.

**Andrew Murray:** Presumably, most people's intestines are inflamed from poor diets, making them more at risk for this passage of starch granules.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and that inflammation weakens the barrier function. It becomes a vicious circle. Two nutrients important in stopping that circle are magnesium and vitamin A, both of which are dependent on having adequate protein in the diet.

**Andrew Murray:** You advocate plenty of butter with potatoes for this reason?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And having digestive enzymes produced abundantly requires good total nutrition and thyroid function.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you have low thyroid function, you have low hydrochloric acid, making it hard to break down food.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All the little glands in the digestive system slow down.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In Mexico, for thousands of years, corn has been prepared specifically to help this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even in my parents' and grandparents' generation, bread making was different. Letting it rise for 8 or 10 hours, the slow leavening process activated enzymes that broke down the starches into sugar and broke down the gluten. This can actually increase the protein by 100 or 200%. Similarly, boiling corn with lime (nixtamalization) decreases toxins and increases nutrients. Since about 1940, the bread industry discovered they could make instant bread by adding chemicals to blow it up.

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the air.

## Caller Questions: Vaccines and Meningitis

**Caller:** I wanted to mention spinal meningitis. My child contracted it when antibiotics didn't work on an ear infection. I believe that is a dangerous disease. However, I've also known parents whose children were paralyzed by the pertussis vaccine. You might want to read the book *The Poisoned Needle*.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you. We are trying not to get into too many specifics due to time.

## Caller Questions: Potato vs. Rice Starch

**Caller (Missouri):** Is there a difference between the starch in white rice and the starch in potatoes? Also, I've heard you say potatoes have high-quality protein. If I eat well-cooked potatoes with butter and a protein like meat, does the body secrete more enzymes effective in breaking down those starch molecules compared to eating just white rice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Norman Pirie wrote a good book on the quality of plant proteins. He rated rice at about 6% value compared to egg yolk at 100%. Leaf protein is about 70%. The protein in potato was about 105%—slightly better than egg yolk. So it is roughly 15 or 20 times better than rice or bean protein.

Regarding the starch grain: the potato grain is one of the biggest, about 100 microns in diameter. Rice starch grains are down around 10 microns.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you think eating protein with the potato increases the enzymatic digestion of the starch?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the potato is very well cooked, it has such high-quality protein that people subsist very well on a pure potato diet. In New Guinea, traditional diets consisted of potatoes for 50 weeks of the year, with pork eaten only during feasts. These people were found to be well-muscled and healthy, as if they had been eating a perfectly balanced diet.

**Caller (Missouri):** Is it possible for a stomach to adapt to secrete specific enzymes if you eat that food for a long time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just in a few months, a person's digestive system will adapt considerably. In animal experiments, if they eat a highly nutritious diet, the intestine is small. If they eat a poor, high-starch, high-fiber diet, the intestine grows in length and mass—almost like producing an organ specifically for the type of food they're eating.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** A good way to get the protein out of the potato is to juice it. You juice a raw potato, let the starch granules sink to the bottom (which looks like corn starch), pour off the clear liquid, and cook that liquid. It cooks up like scrambled eggs. For a vegetarian, that is high-quality protein.

## Caller Questions: Beans and Preparation

**Caller (North Carolina):** Is there a way to process beans, perhaps with an alkali, to transmute the negative effects of the starch?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can find information on nixtamalizing beans. I've never tried it, but some people say it works.

**Andrew Murray:** Would it negate the phytates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it does liberate the minerals from the phytic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Soaking beans is a traditional way to prepare them. Soaking for three days activates enzymes that help break down toxins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That increases the protein value greatly. As they approach sprouting, the storage protein turns to growth protein, which is less toxic and more nutritious.

## Food Additives and Gums

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think of xanthan and carrageenan gums?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, the food industry wanted to add various gums. The FDA looked at the evidence and said they weren't appropriate for food. But 40 or 50 years later, the industry had more power over the FDA. Now they use synthetic gums which are cheaper.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I tell people that additives in dairy, like gums, are often what irritate their intestines, not the dairy itself. Even organic brands have these gums.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they are gradually getting away from carrageenan, which is a powerful allergen and inflammation promoter. Degraded carrageenan is widely recognized as a carcinogen. The industry has promoted the idea that "resistant starches" are health foods because they feed bacteria to produce butyric acid, supposedly preventing bowel cancer. But in fact, absorbing these broken-down products causes changes in the brain and nervous system.

## Caller Questions: Potato Varieties and Acid

**Caller:** Does it matter which kind of potato we eat? I like Yukon Golds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Each variety varies in the quantity of starch relative to protein, but the whole family has high-quality protein. The digestibility is the main difference. High carotene content (yellow color) can make them hard to digest for some people.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And if the skins turn green, that is a toxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, solanine. It's a nightshade poison.

**Caller (Honeydew):** Doesn't too much starch cause acid in your stomach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main function of acid in the stomach is digesting proteins. The stomach judges how much acid to secrete in proportion to the amount of protein it senses. Starch doesn't necessarily stimulate acid production, but it might be irritating if it is hard to digest. If it passes through the intestine without breaking down, it can support bacterial or fungal growth.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think of lecithin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When it comes from eggs produced by well-fed chickens, it's okay. But now it all comes from soybeans. Soybeans are highly unsaturated fat, so it's a way of getting too much PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) into your system. A trace amount, like in a chocolate bar, is harmless.

**Andrew Murray:** We are almost out of time. To wrap up, there are many ingredients in food people aren't aware of: aluminum phosphate, propyl gallate, potassium bromate. It gets worse and worse.

For those who want to know more about Dr. Peat, his website is [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). He has plenty of fully referenced articles there. He's been doing this for at least 45 years. Thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks to our callers and KMUD. Good night.
