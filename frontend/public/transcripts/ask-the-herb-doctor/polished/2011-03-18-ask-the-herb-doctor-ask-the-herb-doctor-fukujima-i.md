## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herbal extracts.

You are listening to KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. Today we are discussing the unfolding facts in Japan. First and foremost, we want to extend our heartfelt, sincere wishes for the people of Japan—that their country recovers and the people find relief, food, shelter, and protection.

Last Friday, there was an 8.9 or 9.0 earthquake which resulted in a tsunami. This caused a catastrophic breakdown in the cooling system of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. We are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, an expert physiologist, chemist, and research scientist. We will be hearing from Dr. Peat about helpful things to do to counter any potential radioactive spread to this country.

Earlier in the week, evidence began to show that the steam leaked from the plants—subsequent to the hydrogen explosions on the buildings housing the reactors—was laden with Iodine-131 and cesium isotopes. These were released as engineers tried to lower the pressure to prevent a breakdown of the containment vessel. One of the reactors, number three, is a mixed oxide fuel reactor containing 6% plutonium and 94% uranium, which would lead to much more serious environmental damage if released.

The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) in Vienna, which monitors the atmosphere for radioactive particles from nuclear testing, released information that this cloud was moving east. Today, a CTBTO station in Sacramento recorded very small, but present, particles of Iodine-131. It is likely coming down in the rain or upper air jet stream.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I want to introduce Dr. Peat and ask him if he believes it is true that radioactive iodine has reached our land yet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is probably present in detectable amounts, but probably not yet biologically significant. However, it could quickly become concentrated enough to affect pregnant women because the fetus concentrates elements from the environment at least 100 times faster than other tissues. During the first two or three months after an accident like that, radioactive iodine would be concentrating in the embryo and fetus. Other isotopes, such as cesium and strontium, would continue to be dangerous if they got into the food supply, but radioactive iodine is the most crucial for developing babies.

## Protective Nutrition and Metabolism

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, what foods and nutrients can help protect us from increasing levels of radioactive iodine, cesium, or strontium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first principle is to dilute the radioactive isotopes with good, stable isotopes. Old food is best. The radioactive iodine isotope is practically gone three months after its production. The others will eventually wash down into the ground. Plants growing in the first few months after an accident will contain those isotopes. If you have canned food, dried milk, or aged cheese, these are very safe and will continue to be safe for months because they were produced before the accident.

The other principle, besides diluting the isotopes, is to increase your resistance to stress and radiation. My very first newsletter 30 years ago was on radiation resistance. I reviewed research from the Atomic Energy Commission and Soviet studies. The main conclusions were that increasing the metabolic rate causes cells to retain magnesium. Magnesium is very important in repairing cell damage. The faster the metabolic rate, generally the more damage can be repaired before it becomes established as a stress factor.

A high metabolic rate produces carbon dioxide, which has an antioxidant, anti-stress effect throughout the organism. If you keep your metabolic rate up and eat a balanced diet, your tissues will retain the magnesium they need and produce the carbon dioxide they need—assuming you are getting adequate protein, sugar, fat, vitamins, and a balance of minerals.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you expand on what types of sugars, fats, and proteins we should be ingesting to keep our metabolic rate high?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ideal fat is coconut oil because the short-chain saturated fatty acids compete with the other fats that normally slow metabolism. For a couple of hours after you eat a tablespoon of coconut oil, your metabolic rate is increased, producing more carbon dioxide and accelerating cell repair processes.

Regarding fruit, the farther south the fruit is grown, the longer it will be free of this high-latitude Japanese radiation. Oranges grown in Mexico, Brazil, and Florida are going to be pretty pure for a very long time. The sugar and minerals in oranges are very close to what we need. So: coconut oil, orange juice, and milk as a good source of calcium.

During the atmospheric bomb tests in the 50s and 60s, the government began recommending people not drink milk because it was contaminated with strontium. However, I looked at the analysis and found that a person getting their nutrition from vegetables would have about five times higher exposure to Strontium-90 than people who got their nutrition primarily from milk and cheese. The cows concentrate the calcium and filter out a little more of the strontium than the vegetables do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You mentioned that to get enough calcium to protect against bone destruction, one would have to drink one to two quarts of milk and eat cheese daily. To get that same amount of calcium from green leafy vegetables, you would need about three pounds of spinach per day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something like that.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And by eating that much spinach, you would actually be exposing yourself to much higher levels of strontium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Elimination and Detoxification

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you recommend for elimination methods if we are breathing in or ingesting radioactive particles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once it gets into your digestive system, if it is incorporated in the food, there is no way to sort it out. But if it is in the water, keeping a lot of fiber flowing through your system helps. Eating fruit or carrots that you know are uncontaminated will sweep the material through your intestine, preventing the absorption of some nutrients at the same time. If you are exposed to a very concentrated dose from rain, it is better to go hungry for a little while while sweeping out your intestine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would you consider the radiation we have been exposed to thus far dangerous enough to avoid milk and vegetables from California and Oregon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not yet. If the reactors start burning fuel rods, someone is likely to leak the information in time for people to take precautions. If it reached the proportions of Chernobyl, it would take extreme measures for a very long time, using only stored, "antique" food.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It sounds like we need to start stocking up on sugar and dried milk powder.

## Potassium Iodide and Kelp

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There is a lot of hype around using potassium iodide (KI) and kelp. How do these help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It simply dilutes the radioactive isotope. When you take in a lot of old, stable iodine, it saturates your thyroid. Your thyroid shuts down and stops taking up any more. If you add radioactive iodine to a saturated person, it just gradually washes out without concentrating in the thyroid.

However, if a person is deficient in iodine, almost all of it will stick in the thyroid gland once it enters the bloodstream, giving an extremely high dose to the gland—and even more so to a developing embryo.

Potassium iodide is very good protection, but *only* from damage to the thyroid gland. It doesn't protect against other isotopes or other tissues. If you take more than enough to saturate your tissues—the CDC advocates 160mg as one dose—every day for a long time, your thyroid gland would shut down. Your metabolism and defensive reactions would slow down, making you more susceptible to injury throughout the rest of your body.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you are not recommending people take kelp powder or potassium iodide at this current level?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The minimum requirement is only 150 or 200 micrograms. Even one milligram per day continued for a long time increases the risk of thyroiditis.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you know how much is in kelp powder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably a half teaspoon is adequate to saturate most people. One half-teaspoon dose isn't going to hurt anyone, but you don't want to do that every day for a long time.

## Historical Context: Chernobyl and Bomb Tests

**Andrew Murray:** The radioactive iodine in Chernobyl was responsible for the increase in thyroid cancers. You are saying pregnant women are more susceptible than young children?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Ernest Sternglass studied this during the atmospheric bomb tests. The government timed tests in Nevada so the wind blew toward Utah rather than California cities. Utah suffered the most autoimmune diseases and cancer. Occasionally, fallout would reach the East Coast. Sternglass found high radiation levels at his university that the government hadn't mentioned. He showed there were likely tens of thousands of miscarriages. A high percentage of surviving babies were hypothyroid or born without thyroid glands. As long as they were breastfed, the mother's thyroid hormones in the milk covered up the symptoms until they were weaned.

## Monitoring Radiation

**Andrew Murray:** I found the most up-to-date information coming from *Russia Today*. What is the best source for people in America to find real-time figures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is an anti-nuclear power site that is getting up-to-date information.

**Andrew Murray:** I was looking at Geiger counters on eBay. They are usually inexpensive, but prices have jumped.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For a while, you could get old Soviet Geiger counters for about $15. Someone told me the price went from $35 to $75 as soon as the radiation scare hit.

**Caller 1:** I'm actually holding mine right here. I got the cheapest one for about $250. The really expensive ones are $10,000 to $20,000. It's not beeping much more than normal right now.

## Anti-Radiation Nutrients: Caffeine, Aspirin, and Vitamins

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Let's discuss caffeine. How does it protect against radiation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee is a good source of magnesium and niacin (Vitamin B3). Caffeine is anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant. If you have mobile isotopes in your bloodstream going through your kidneys, caffeine helps flush them out faster. It has a slight chelating effect.

The radiation effect itself imitates estrogen in the body. Everything estrogen does can be imitated by radiation. If you are in a high-estrogen state, you are more susceptible to radiation injury. That is why progesterone, thyroid, and caffeine—by helping to lower estrogen and inflammation—are protective.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To recap:
*   **Caffeine/Coffee:** Magnesium, B vitamins.
*   **Progesterone:** Blocks estrogenic effects.
*   **Vitamin E:** Blocks estrogen.
*   **Vitamin C:** Orange juice/tropical fruits.
*   **Vitamin A:** Eggs and liver (helps repair).

What about glutathione?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is confusion there. Anything that harms your cells turns on a defensive reaction and increases glutathione. Many harmful things stimulate that defense. Taking large doses of glutathione was shown in animal studies to be carcinogenic to the liver by starting free radical reactions rather than stopping them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about animal liver? It contains B vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins, but people worry about toxicity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver is the main detoxifying organ, but it cleans itself quickly. Studies on beef showed that while muscle and fat tissues retained chemical contaminants, only a tiny proportion of livers had toxins left. After about 24 hours of exposure, the liver has cleaned itself. The fats are the most risky for chemical poisoning; the liver is the cleanest.

## Caller Questions

### The "Downwinder" & Bananas

**Caller 2:** I saw a map showing the plume hitting Cape Mendocino. I missed the name of the colon cleanser you mentioned.

**Andrew Murray:** Grated raw carrot.

**Caller 2:** Does garlic help bring iodine into the system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has some antioxidant effect, but I don't think it has a big effect on iodine.

**Caller 2:** We are trying to safeguard with a "potassium iodine salad" made of bananas and seaweed. Is there a cautionary amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sea organisms like shrimp, oysters, and clams are good sources of iodine. However, the banana issue brings up an important aspect. Bananas are one of the richest food sources of serotonin.

Biologists have found that low-level ionizing radiation causes cells to produce serotonin. Even if you take the injured cells out, the water they were in becomes equivalent to radiation for other cells due to the chemicals released. Serotonin is one of those communicators of radiation damage (the bystander effect). I think it is good to avoid sources of serotonin, especially bananas.

**Caller 2:** Is there any benefit to dried vs. fresh bananas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think shifting toward gelatinous meats and away from muscle meats helps reduce the tendency to produce serotonin. A good balance of vitamins and minerals helps avoid excess serotonin production.

**Caller 2:** What can men take to preempt the estrogenic effect of radionuclides? And is bottled water better than well water right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For men, keeping thyroid function high is the main thing. Aspirin and thyroid inhibit the estrogen produced by stress. Regarding water, a good filter for well water is adequate.

**Andrew Murray:** Does a carbon filter sequester iodine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, activated charcoal absorbs almost any solid.

### Seaweed and Allergies

**Caller 3:** Brown seaweeds like kombu contain sodium alginate, which is supposed to take heavy metals out of the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they pass through your intestine, yes. Anything indigestible that stimulates your intestine will sweep out. However, alginate is dangerously allergenic for many people. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are sure you aren't sensitive to it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Raw carrots are absorptive and non-digestible. Also, taking too much seaweed will lower your metabolic rate and suppress the thyroid.

### Mushrooms

**Caller 4:** I recommend Turkey Tail mushrooms (*Trametes versicolor*). They are used in Asia as an anti-cancer drug and for immune support.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you. People can check that out online.

### EPA Data

**Caller 5:** The EPA has a website with graphical representations of raw data from monitoring sites. It is `epa.gov/japan2011/rert/radnet-data.html`.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you. People can compare that to the CTBTO information.

### D-Ribose

**Caller 6:** I was wondering about using D-Ribose to raise the metabolic rate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main risk is that substances produced industrially often have contaminants not mentioned on the labels. You have to be cautious of allergic reactions to semi-purified chemicals.

### Supplements vs. Whole Foods

**Caller 7:** Are you suggesting we only get vitamins from whole foods, or are supplements okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For an emergency period of two or three weeks while the cloud passes, a B-complex supplement could be helpful to support a maximal metabolic rate. But eating extra eggs and milk is better. A B-vitamin supplement is pretty safe.

## Closing Thoughts

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If cesium has a half-life of 30 years and is heavier than iodine, will it fall out over the ocean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There would be a little bit of everything produced in the fallout.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Orange juice is rich in potassium, which helps the body pick up less cesium, similar to how kelp helps with iodine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Fifty years ago, I proposed that the safe thing would be to have industrial-sized greenhouses. If they continued atmospheric bomb tests, vegetables should be grown in greenhouses using fossil carbon dioxide (from coal or petroleum) to avoid radioactive carbon, and limestone for calcium.

One reason I wrote my newsletter in 1981 on radiation protection was that babies born nine months after the huge 1963 bomb tests had the lowest SAT scores in history by 1981. The high scores decreased progressively in proportion to the amount of fallout.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to call it a night. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.
