## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. Sarah is not joining me today. We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and manufacture our own certified organic herb extracts.

You are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of environmental enrichment. We are also going to look at a couple of recent articles that have caused a bit of a stir and refute them for the bad science they contain.

I’d like to introduce a seemingly permanent fixture to the show, Dr. Raymond Peat. Thank you for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** As always, I'd like you to give an introduction of your academic background for those who have just tuned in.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 60s I taught biology, literature, and painting. I went to graduate school from 1968 to 1972, studying biochemistry, reproductive aging, and physiology in general. Since then, I've been continuing some of the same projects that I started back in the late 60s.

## Bad Science: The Sugar and Aggression Study

**Andrew Murray:** You are a fairly prolific researcher of topics both old and new, finding out the truth about where the science is coming from. This leads me to a couple of articles I wanted you to discuss. One of them caused a stir regarding topics we've discussed in the past—like salt, sugar, and saturated fats being good for you.

Recently, an article was published that seemed to shoot down the benefits of sugar. It was done with mice at the University of Utah. The bottom line of the article was calling sugar poisonous, claiming it caused early death and negative effects on the ability to control territory and dominate others. You're familiar with that study?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it just came out a couple of days ago. It basically says that the amount of sugar—fructose and sucrose—in three sweetened drinks, which a large part of the American population averages per day, causes extremely high mortality when given to mice. It was presented as the next best thing to rat poison. In a period of about 32 weeks, 35% of the sugar-reared females died, while only 17% of the so-called "stock diet" females died.

**Andrew Murray:** That sounds bad on the face of it. Can you explain the science behind the findings?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was twice as many deaths in a moderate period of time. It was so weird and extreme that I looked up what that group had been doing before this study. They were working on inbreeding. They found that the inbred mice had high mortality, and aggression was designed into their living arrangement. They thought of it as accelerated evolution, in which the survival of the meanest would be evident in a very short time.

It happened that a year or two before they switched to the sugar study, there were papers published showing that a diet enriched in starch and polyunsaturated fats powerfully increased aggression and mouse-killing in rats. So, the connection between starch, polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), and aggression was clearly established.

They had an environmental setup that allowed aggression to kill off part of the population fairly quickly. I don't think it was an objective study of the effect of sugar because the so-called "stock diet" consisted of grains and soy protein, with 25% cornstarch added. The grains contained polyunsaturated fats. It was a model of the aggression-promoting diet. They didn't mention in their publicity that the "normal" diet allowed higher survival in the females simply because the sugar-reared population was living with a population on starch and polyunsaturated fats that endangered the passive animals.

**Andrew Murray:** So, just fairly bad science turned into a mainstream article.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They created an arrangement in which feeding one group so they became aggressive allowed them to take over the food supply and nesting arrangements, bullying the weaker animals until they died. That extremely high mortality is not produced by drinking three sodas a day.

## Bad Science: Synthroid (T4) and Lung Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** There was another article from a study done in Italy which referenced the intake of T4, specifically Synthroid—a common prescription for thyroid deficiency—and a link between Synthroid use and lung cancer. What did you find erroneous about that study?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were animal studies with lung cancer specifically that are very relevant. They found that T3, the active thyroid hormone, inhibited the growth of the cancer cells, but T4 increased their growth and metastatic ability.

This is similar to studies starting about 30 years ago. There was a study in the late 80s comparing a group of hypothyroid women treated with T4 only (Synthroid) to a group of women who weren't given any thyroid supplements. They reported that the ones who received the T4 had a higher rate of osteoporosis. However, since low thyroid is compensated by high cortisol and high prolactin—stress hormones which cause bone problems—what they were doing was looking at a population with a thyroid problem treated insufficiently.

It has been known for decades that women are much less able to convert T4 into the active hormone, T3. So, it's especially inappropriate for treating women with hypothyroidism to give only T4.

**Andrew Murray:** You're not really an advocate of using just T4 anyway, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both thyroid hormones, if you can convert the thyroxine (T4) into T3, can have a very important anti-oxidative damage function. By increasing the rate of useful oxidation, they keep electrons from escaping the mitochondria and prevent random oxidative damage. When you find increased oxidative breakdown products when giving T4, it shows that you're not activating oxidative metabolism the way thyroid normally does. You're interfering in some way with the respiratory system.

## Environmental Enrichment and Brain Health

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to the main topic: environmental enrichment in terms of staving off brain atrophy and its reference to Alzheimer's. Findings show an association between Alzheimer's and increased levels of destructive inflammatory mediators like nitric oxide and cortisol. What do you know about environmental enrichment regarding energy and anti-inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The observation that people with Alzheimer's have drastically reduced living variety—they tend not to socialize as much as resistant people—started me thinking about the general range of stimulation. Old people often develop the habit of staying at home.

Animal studies looked at isolation at different ages. There is a gradient from living in a playground with slides and wheels, all the way down to being rolled up in a blanket so you can't move. You see the same things happening: the worse the stress, the smaller the brain gets. Depression is known to increase cortisol and cause atrophy of tissues, including the brain. After about three years of psychological depression, people show a reduction in brain volume.

In the 1960s at UC Berkeley, they found that animals given a big playground learned better and could solve problems better. When they examined their brains, they found that the enzyme cholinesterase was increased in proportion to how much they were stimulated. This involved enlargement of the whole brain, especially the cortex.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's passed on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in a physiological sort of inheritance. But at the time, they were interested in the fact that the environment could cause these major biological changes.

A lot of people reasoned that if you're destroying acetylcholine at a higher rate (via increased cholinesterase) and the brain gets bigger, you must have more activity of the cholinergic nerves. But that isn't what they found. They found the enzyme that *destroys* it was increased as the brain got bigger.

That reasoning shifted to thinking about Alzheimer's. They saw less tissue in the cholinergic part of the brain. No one suggested that maybe over-exposure to acetylcholine might have something to do with why the nerves atrophied. Because stress signals increase factors that cause brain shrinkage, they proposed *poisoning* the enzyme cholinesterase—which was associated in animal studies with increased intelligence and brain growth. They proposed doing the opposite: poisoning that enzyme to increase the amount of acetylcholine.

**Andrew Murray:** And that led to drugs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first drug proposed was Tacrine. By the late 90s, they saw it did absolutely nothing for dementia but caused a high incidence of liver disease.

In the 70s, they were looking for Parkinson's treatments and found that Amantadine (a derivative of camphor used for viruses) had nerve-protective action. They found it benefited Parkinson's, which involved an excess of acetylcholine. Amantadine was known to be an anticholinergic drug.

The Alzheimer's researchers, seeing the success with Parkinson's, wanted to try it. But since they were already treating by *increasing* acetylcholine, they couldn't switch to something that inhibited it. So, they suddenly "discovered" that Amantadine and Memantine also inhibit excitotoxins (glutamate/aspartate). Suddenly, this anticholinergic drug became an "anti-excitatory" drug and was fit to be used in Alzheimer's patients in combination with drugs that poison the enzyme—drugs which do the exact opposite.

**Andrew Murray:** I was always taught that acetylcholine was a very important neurotransmitter, mopped up by acetylcholinesterase to prevent overstimulation. So we are talking about an excess situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In inescapable stress, the body shifts gears. Rather than pushing higher on cortisol and adrenaline, the body sees futility. It turns off that system and turns on the cholinergic system. This lowers blood sugar. Consequently, lowering blood sugar activates histamine release. You can think of this kind of inescapable stress as turning on the histamine-type cholinergic reaction.

**Andrew Murray:** This sounds like a death situation—going towards death and away from life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the "learned helplessness" experiments of the 60s, Martin Seligman found that if you almost drowned a rat but saved it, the rat would swim for days the next time. But if you held the rat until it felt powerless, one experience of being unable to escape meant it would give up and drown in 30 minutes. They found the heart was in a turned-off state—a cholinergic, anti-mobilization of energy state.

## Caller: Toe Fungus and Food Irradiation

**Caller:** I have a question about toe fungus. Dr. Peat, you mentioned sulfur was good for fungus. Would it work for toe fungus, and should I use DMSO to get it in there? Also, what are your thoughts on food irradiation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a 10% sulfur soap sold at drugstores that works very well for athlete's foot.

**Caller:** This is deeper, in the nail bed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once it gets into the nail, it's very hard to get anything in there. It's possible DMSO would help it penetrate, but the fungus lives right inside the thick nail material.

**Caller:** And regarding irradiation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has been known for a long time that it breaks down fragile, easily oxidized nutrients, changes amino acids, and turns tryptophan into toxins. The radiation waste disposal industry advocates for it, but studies show it changes the flavor drastically—giving it a rancid flavor almost instantly.

## Caller: Kava and Liver Damage

**Caller:** I have a question about Kava. It's supposedly a powerful anxiolytic. I've heard studies say it causes liver damage, but that those studies used the above-ground parts or specific extracts. What are your thoughts?

**Andrew Murray:** The parts used are the roots. The study that showed hepatotoxic effects was another example of skewed science; it was done with a hexane extract of Kava. The hexane was probably more carcinogenic than anything else. In Fiji and the Philippines, where they use Kava ceremoniously, there is no real recorded incidence of liver toxic effects.

**Caller:** Do you see any long-term negative effects of using Kava tonically?

**Andrew Murray:** I haven't witnessed long-term effects myself. Its main indication is to relax skeletal muscle. In a ceremony, it is ingested in large amounts for a profound relaxant activity. Therapeutically, the dose would be lower.

## Caller: Thyroid Medication (T4 vs. T3)

**Caller:** My thyroid is a bit low, and I'm on 88 micrograms of Levothyroxine (T4). My endocrinologist says we convert T4 into T3 automatically. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason women have five to ten times the number of thyroid problems as men is that their liver is relatively unable to convert T4 to the active T3 hormone efficiently. In the 1940s, when T4 was synthesized, it was tested on male medical students, and it worked for them. They didn't bother testing it on a female population.

**Caller:** They do blood tests and tell me my thyroid is normal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They changed the "normal" level. Previous to the use of pure thyroxine, there was a specific ratio of thyroxine to T3. Now they consider a 50-to-1 ratio to be normal. The blood test has been standardized on a population of people using only thyroxine.

**Caller:** If I took Armour thyroid, which has T3, would I make better use of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is exactly the proportion your own gland secretes. If your liver is responding to the active T3, it will convert the rest. However, if you take Armour and metabolize it perfectly, your blood test will show "excess" T3 because the test is standardized for thyroxine users.

**Caller:** What are the symptoms of low thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cold hands and feet, low blood sugar, anxiety, fatigue, depression, dry skin, edema, and craving sweets.

**Caller:** I had atrial fibrillation and was diagnosed with hyperthyroid. I chose radioactive iodine treatment to shrink the thyroid. Now I take the 88 micrograms. If I don't have symptoms, should I stick with what I'm doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, temperature, pulse rate, and symptoms are good indicators. If you don't have symptoms, you are likely handling it properly.

## Caller: Seeds, Skins, and Sugar

**Caller:** I notice in the *East West Healing Cookbook* that they remove seeds from cucumbers and tomatoes and skin potatoes. Is this because they lodge in the intestine or feed bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some seeds pass through harmlessly, but tomato seeds are so tender that if crushed by chewing, they release fairly toxic, protein-oxidizing materials. Seeds generally contain toxins to prevent mammalian enzymes from digesting them.

**Caller:** What about potato skins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cellulose is harmless fiber, but the potato family—like tomatoes—includes chemicals that are highly allergenic. The skin has the most allergens.

**Caller:** Regarding sugar, you usually recommend plain white sugar rather than the organic cane sugars that are brownish. Is that because of impurities?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you taste blackstrap molasses, you can sometimes taste smoke. They used to burn cane fields to harvest them. Molasses collects minerals but also the junk and smoky material. When sugar is browned by cooking, it breaks down and produces irritating, possibly toxic materials.

**Caller:** So white sugar is safer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, or fruit, which is really ideal because you get nutrients with the sugar.

**Caller:** Does cooking deactivate the enzymes in tomato seeds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It deactivates the enzymes, but it doesn't destroy the allergens.

## Caller: Salt and Fats

**Caller:** What is Dr. Peat's position on salt and fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Saturated fats are good. Clean white salt, like sea salt without additives, is good.

## Caller: Turmeric and Alzheimer's

**Caller:** I want to mention that Alzheimer's can come with iron deposits in the brain. Turmeric has been recognized as being able to chelate that iron. Curcumin is the active component. Also, for toe fungus, Neem is a traditional medicine.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think about the iron deposits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That fits right into what we've been talking about regarding stress hormones leading to Alzheimer's. Iron is the endpoint of all these changes. Nitric oxide and prostaglandins activate enzymes which release and deposit iron in the brain, where it continues amplifying the destructive reactions.
