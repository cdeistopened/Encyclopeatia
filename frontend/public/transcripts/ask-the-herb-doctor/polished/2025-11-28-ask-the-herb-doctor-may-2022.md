## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's May 2022 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. Sarah is not joining us this evening, but next month she'll be back. It is a beautiful spring evening, warm and clear. We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us with his expertise.

I have an intro that I'm going to read after we get Dr. Peat on the air. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us as always. For those who perhaps have never heard of you before, would you please outline your professional and scientific background so people know where you're coming from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 50s and 60s, I was working in humanities—literature, painting, and philosophy. My interest in how consciousness works led me to decide that understanding language and art would help to understand what the brain is and how the brain is conscious. I went back to graduate school in 1968 at the University of Oregon, intending to concentrate on brain studies. However, I found that the department working on the brain was extremely dogmatic.

I looked around and found that at the other end of the organism—the reproductive system—the professors were actually scientific and didn't throw out data just because it didn't agree with the dogma. I did my dissertation on the oxidative aging process as it relates to the reproductive system. It turned out that gives a very interesting background to things such as how the brain works. This was a theme existing in biology 100 years ago—how electrons and biological energy power perceptions and consciousness—but it had been squeezed out. Right from the early years of science, corporations were squeezing out the freely exploring researchers and subsidizing people who would work for their corporate interests.

## Technocracy, Transhumanism, and The Great Reset

**Andrew Murray:** Since the very beginning of 2020, we have been skeptical, to say the least, of the organization and rollout of the COVID pandemic. At this point, it seems to have fizzled into a non-event compared to what was forecast. However, the rhetoric has continued that this is alarming and must be controlled via lockdowns and mandates. This aligns with what the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab have been working at since the 1930s.

Regarding transhumanism, Klaus Schwab has said, "You will own nothing and be happy." There is a premise that biological evolution will be overtaken by genetic, wearable, implantable, or injectable technologies that artificially expedite the evolutionary process—called the Great Reset.

In the 1940s and 50s, you knew people involved in Technocracy Incorporated. What are your thoughts on this movement toward transhumanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s and 50s, I knew people who had become convinced members of Technocracy Incorporated. The stock market has been one of the techniques to take over the assets of the world. Every time the value of the stock collapses, small investors get killed by it, and the giant corporations get bigger. It is like a ratchet to shake loose the bulk of investors and constantly refine ownership to a smaller group.

People injured by the economic breakdown in 1930 had good intentions and said, "The corporate engineers know what needs to be done. If we turn the operation of the economy over to scientists and engineers, they will make sure we don't have these collapses." Except the scientists and engineers are working for the big corporations that engineer the collapse. These people were well-meaning but gullible.

By 1950, it was a turning point when the government came out and said that "Big Science" is the only science, and government has to direct, finance, and control it. There hasn't been any pretense of science being a free enterprise since then. The journals and universities were absolutely taken over by the funding of giant corporations and government agencies.

**Andrew Murray:** When I looked at Technocracy earlier, they couch this in terms of the "green economy" and "sustainable development." While I agree with moving away from polluting fossil fuels, the interpretation of the green economy by the technocrats is a different picture.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way they manipulate science involves selling an ideology to the general population which justifies a reductionist view of biology and evolution. The intelligence of the organism and development has been ruled out of science in favor of randomness being the key to everything.

Supposedly, evolution is a matter of infinite random events. When you look at how that really works, it is a degrading process, not an advancing process. Barbara McClintock, in the 1940s and 50s, showed that plants—corn specifically—use intelligent modification of their own genes to improve their situation. Her objective scientific work ruled her out of the functional world of science. She wasn't invited to conferences, and her papers weren't published.

From the 1950s for several decades, she was non-existent in the world of evolution and genes. But then Monsanto was criticized for making new organisms and seeds to sell their Roundup. In the universities, professors went along with the idea that genetic engineering would be done by smart people like them, so nothing could go wrong.

To add to that, when Monsanto ran into the reality that their process is very deadly and causes more harm than benefit, they needed propaganda. They decided to say that Barbara McClintock had demonstrated that plants use genetic engineering, so it must be a perfectly natural thing. They argued that if plants could do it on their own, it must be just as safe if Monsanto does it. This is a total misunderstanding of what biology is.

## Caller: Endometriosis and Progesterone

**Caller:** I have a question about my wife. She has been having prolonged bleeding. She started taking progesterone—2.5 milligrams—and it helped cut the bleeding off, but when she stops taking it, the bleeding continues. Because they found something in the ultrasound, they want to do a hysteroscopy and potentially a curettage. If they find abnormal cells, what would be the next step to reverse this?

**Andrew Murray:** Let's clarify: is it actual progesterone or a progestin?

**Caller:** It says "Med-progesterone" [likely Medroxyprogesterone]. It is prescribed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What was the dose?

**Caller:** 2.5 mg.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That can't be real progesterone. Real progesterone wouldn't do anything at that dose.

**Caller:** She was on 10 milligrams a few days ago, but it gave her headaches. It did cut the bleeding, but the side effects were too strong.

**Andrew Murray:** Has she tried natural progesterone?

**Caller:** No, she hasn't tried natural progesterone or thyroid. It's hard to get her to start supplements.

**Andrew Murray:** If she has endometriosis and uncontrolled estrogen dominance, I would advise against a hysterectomy unless she has exhausted natural progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The function of thyroid is to increase natural progesterone production while decreasing estrogen. It has a very high success rate in endometriosis because that condition is caused by a thyroid deficiency with estrogen excess.

I have known several people where, on the very first day of correcting their thyroid function, their symptoms disappeared. For a few months, I kept track of 36 women who were told they needed a biopsy or partial hysterectomy because of abnormal cells. Within a month of using supplements, including thyroid, every one of those 36 women went back and the doctors could find no evidence of abnormal cells.

**Caller:** Is there a desiccated thyroid we can find on the market that is well tolerated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but keep in mind that T4 is a stabilizing influence that has a half-life in the body of about two weeks. If you try to get a quick effect with a T4-containing product like Armour Thyroid or Cynoplus, you will have a good effect immediately, but then you might overdose after four or five days.

**Caller:** What about the hysteroscopy and biopsy to diagnose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can stop the symptoms of too much bleeding and pain very quickly with a combination of the right hormones—thyroid and progesterone—then within a couple of weeks, the abnormal cells will probably have been normalized or shed.

**Caller 2:** I wanted to share that I had a similar situation five years ago. I went to the hospital, and they wanted to do a hysterectomy. I used Progest-E—the kind Ray recommends—and Cynoplus and Cytomel. As soon as I got my T3 up, the bleeding stopped. I continue to use progesterone to this day. They wanted to do radiation and all these things, but I refused.

## Patents and Genetic Engineering

**Andrew Murray:** Moving back to the GMO topic, farmers all over the world were getting sued by Monsanto because their organic corn had GMO corn present due to cross-pollination. Now, Monsanto has patents on what was considered unpatentable biological material.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The virologists have patented all these segments of viral genomes so that if there is a potential pandemic in the future which has this little bit of a genome in it, they can get a patent on the vaccine for it.

**Andrew Murray:** We covered this in a previous show regarding the work of David Martin. He has a huge database of all the companies issued patents on coronaviruses.

**Caller 3 (Shelter Cove):** I'd like to mention that Vitamin D is extremely important. I had low Vitamin D levels down to 16, which contributed to my Hashimoto's diagnosis.

**Andrew Murray:** I totally agree. Vitamin D deficiency is rampant. A good Vitamin D supplement of 5,000 IU a day should get most people into a good range.

## Censorship and Medical Legislation

**Andrew Murray:** I want to discuss California Assembly Bill 2098. It would make it easier for the Medical Board of California to discipline doctors who promote "COVID-19 misinformation" by classifying it as unprofessional conduct. Essentially, anything that does not conform to government guidelines could be punishable. This threatens the doctor-patient relationship and the doctor's ability to use their professional judgment. Dr. Peat, what do you think of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Until just recently, the medical licensing system has been used to exclude alternate theories of medicine—chiropractic, homeopathy, and herbal therapies. These were controlled by the powers of the medical monopoly, and the doctors were fine with that.

But now, the government has decided that doctors don't even have the power to define what their own monopoly believes. The government has taken away that autonomy. They shouldn't have had such powerful control over defining who is a physician in the first place, but now they have lost everything, along with the power to deal privately with a patient. The government is the final and only word on what constitutes medicine.

**Andrew Murray:** We also heard about the "Ministry of Truth"—the Disinformation Governance Board announced by the DHS. It has been put on pause, but I assume it will morph into something else.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government had been working directly through giant organizations like Facebook and Wikipedia all along. They simply gave orders. These companies were created by funding coming from the Pentagon, so they've been committed to cooperating with the government. Thousands of accounts are being closed by the recommendation of the government. They don't really need a formal agent to do what they've been doing all along.
