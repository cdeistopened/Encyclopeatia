## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of blood pressure regulation, heart failure, and muscle atrophy. The number here, if you live in the area, is 923-3911. If you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat to share his experience and wisdom. He has been extensively researching many different areas of health and nutrition for probably 30 years or more.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Over 40.

**Andrew Murray:** Over 40. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us on the show again. For those who may not know you, would you let the listeners know your professional academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology for a PhD at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. Before that, I had been in linguistics, art, and taught a variety of health-related courses, psychology, and philosophy. My graduate study in biology concentrated on the aging of the reproductive system. I originally intended to study brain biology because of my previous work in linguistics and psychology—I wanted to understand how the brain handled consciousness and language. However, at the university, I discovered that the biologists were really no more scientific than the people in the humanities. It was very heavily ideological. That was why I shifted over to the other end of the organism where I could look at more physical, biochemical processes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It sounds very well rounded because the psyche affects biochemistry and biochemistry affects the psyche.

## Saturated Fats vs. Polyunsaturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** This month's show is based around your newsletter regarding blood pressure regulation, muscle atrophy, heart failure, and edema. You have been purporting that saturated fats are better than polyunsaturates for a long time. How long has that been?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I really started thinking intensively about it at the end of the 70s. But I ran into the question directly in aging research in the reproductive system. Way back in the 1930s and 40s, people were showing that estrogen accelerated the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), which intensified the effects of estrogen and accelerated aging, especially in the reproductive tissues. It took several years after finishing my dissertation before I concentrated on the nutritional implications of that and emphasized the benefits of coconut oil around 1978 or 1979.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So back then, there was already literature showing that saturated fats—coming from animal fats and coconut oil—were better than the polyunsaturates, which are the liquid vegetable oils now present in pork, chicken fat, and fish because of what they're feeding these animals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. By the 1940s or 50s, the polyunsaturated fats, both fish oil and seed oil, had been incriminated in intensifying estrogen and age-related diseases. The Shute family, who were the first to popularize the therapeutic use of Vitamin E, started out with preventing blood clots related to high estrogen. That overlaps with estrogen activating the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats, producing free radicals and causing vascular disease. Vitamin E was a fertility drug and an anti-estrogen nutrient, as well as protection against the polyunsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Lots of people consider Vitamin E to be an antioxidant to help protect us against free radicals. But you're saying that the free radical producing substance is this vegetable oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, before the antioxidant concept was introduced, Vitamin E was thought of as an anti-estrogen. But in 1942, the estrogen industry basically took over the FDA and public consciousness and suppressed everything that incriminated estrogen in aging and miscarriage. Since Vitamin E was identified as an anti-estrogen, the industry shifted the emphasis to protection against free radical oxidation.

There was quickly an awareness of an inverse relationship between polyunsaturated fats and Vitamin E. If you increased your Vitamin E greatly, you could prevent damage from either estrogen or polyunsaturated fats. However, with aging and the accumulation of fats in the body, you had to increase the amount of Vitamin E to prevent miscarriage. My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, showed that you could prevent middle-aged infertility just by increasing Vitamin E. Extrapolating to human levels, it would be the equivalent of 400 units of Vitamin E per day by age 45 to maintain fertility. But that amount increases if you increase the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet. If you carefully avoid the polyunsaturates, your requirement for Vitamin E is very low.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** With increasing polyunsaturates in the American diet, the need for Vitamin E has gone up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it very quickly reaches the point where you can no longer stop the free radical production just by increasing the Vitamin E.

## Heart Failure and Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** There were two peer-reviewed articles, one from 2009 and one from 2011, which published data proving that saturated fat intake improved mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure compared to PUFA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The 2011 study was by Galvao and others. A high intake of saturated fat improves survival while a high intake of polyunsaturated fat does not.

**Andrew Murray:** And how do triglycerides affect this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** According to Horwich and others in the 2009 study, a higher level of lipoproteins—total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides—are all associated with improved survival in heart failure patients.

**Andrew Murray:** So a higher cholesterol is directly responsible for an improved outcome. That is staggering because the medical community tells people not to consume saturated animal fats because it raises cholesterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The seed oil industry created that myth because they found that eating a lot of seed oil would lower your cholesterol. Since you have cholesterol in atherosclerotic arteries, they said it must be causing the atherosclerosis. That was never demonstrated. In fact, cholesterol protects against atherosclerosis.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wasn't there a study showing oxidized Omega-3 and Omega-6 in the plaques of deteriorated arteries?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the pigment found in plaques is the product of the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we can look at cholesterol as an antioxidant bandage trying to stop that rapid rate of oxidation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was demonstrated and published in a major medical textbook in 1922.

## Caller: Chia Seeds and Blood Pressure Medication

**Caller:** I'm 68 and very active. I eat yogurt, fruit, and vegetables with olive oil. My doctor recently prescribed a blood pressure medicine, Amlodipine, that makes me unenergetic. For the past two weeks, I've been taking a tablespoon of chia seeds, and they give me energy. What is the doctor's opinion of counteracting the blood pressure medicine with chia seeds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Did you say the drug was to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)? That's the one heart drug that I think is probably beneficial because it lowers inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** She mentioned Amlodipine. Her question is, what do you think about the chia seeds helping re-energize her?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know of anything in the chia seeds that would be beneficial.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They are very mucilaginous. Could they be acting as a laxative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it works as a bulk laxative, it would make you feel better by lowering bacterial endotoxins.

## Endotoxin, Inflammation, and Energy Production

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned that if someone took a bulk laxative, they would feel better by lowering endotoxin. Can you tell us how endotoxin poisons us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Endotoxin triggers nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator. Both nitric oxide and endotoxin increase the production of serotonin. All of these inhibit the production of energy using oxygen and shift it over to lactic acid production. They also increase the leakiness of blood vessels.

Anything that impairs energy production—whether it's toxins like endotoxin, nitric oxide, and serotonin, or environmental interference—makes your blood vessels leaky. This raises free fatty acids, which interfere with the use of oxygen. Free fatty acids lead to a cascade of inflammatory mediators, especially prostaglandins. Once you get loaded up with polyunsaturated fats, all of these things interact. The fats lower your thyroid function and increase estrogen production, both of which intensify inflammation, leakiness, and loss of energy production.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To mitigate the bacteria feeding on starches, you recommend carrots and bamboo shoots because they are antibacterial fibers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's extremely rare for a person to have microorganisms that can survive a good supply of either carrots or bamboo fiber.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And saturated fats like coconut oil are also antimicrobial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is one of their direct effects.

## Copper, Iron, and Respiratory Enzymes

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You wrote in your newsletter about the substitution of iron for copper in the respiratory enzyme. Is this a copper deficiency or iron overload?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Diet can affect it, but stress tends to intensify it. Anything that stresses your energy production system—such as high estrogen, nitric oxide, low thyroid, or too much darkness—will tend to make you lose copper from your respiratory system. As copper gets lost, iron tends to fill in for it, binding to some of the same enzymes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** With the current situation in the Pacific Ocean, what would you recommend as a good source of copper?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Beef liver. It has a lot of iron too, but the copper tends to concentrate in the liver.

**Andrew Murray:** Does the respiratory enzyme have a greater affinity for copper than iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you have an adequate supply of copper, it will get picked up. Iron is problematic because it is very reactive; it acts as another oxidant. Taking a supplement of a free metal—iron, zinc, or copper—can interact with nutrients in your digestive system and oxidize them. Iron is the worst one to take as a supplement.

## Thyroid, Diet, and Estrogen

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What else interferes with thyroid hormone regarding heart failure and high blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Polyunsaturated fats and stress are the most common things in Western culture. Traditionally, the cabbage family and beans were the main goitrogens (things that interfere with thyroid hormone formation). In the Andes, parts of southern Mexico, and western China, there is still a tremendous amount of thyroid deficiency and cretinism. Beans and the cabbage family—especially if not cooked well, like coleslaw—are major factors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about poor protein intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, studies showed that men coming out of concentration camps who started eating well would often grow breasts. Starvation for protein causes the liver to become unable to destroy estrogen. Thyroid is needed to inactivate estrogen. If you have a protein deficiency, your thyroid slows down defensively to stop eating up muscle protein. This slows the liver, leaving more estrogen in circulation. Estrogen then blocks the enzymes which attach iodine to the protein to make thyroid hormone. It creates a vicious circle.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And liver is one of the best sources for B vitamins, which help the liver inactivate estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Animal studies showed that vitamins B1, B2, and protein were the main things that activate the liver to inactivate estrogen.

## Caller: Simvastatin and Low Cholesterol

**Caller:** I've been on a regimen of Simvastatin, 80 milligrams, for the past three years following a heart attack four years ago. What is the downside of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on how much it interferes with cholesterol synthesis. When you interfere with cholesterol synthesis, you're also interfering with essential things such as the synthesis of Coenzyme Q10. That can cause muscle problems because Coenzyme Q10 is needed for producing energy.

**Caller:** My cholesterol has come down quite a lot. HDL is 49, LDL is 46, and total is 147.

**Andrew Murray:** That is very low.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it was in the normal range before, you might actually not have had enough protective effect from cholesterol. Cholesterol can protect you from heavy metal poisoning and many kinds of toxins.

**Andrew Murray:** There are several articles on Dr. Peat's website specifically on cholesterol and its cardio-protective effects.

## Caller: Atrophy and Pinched Nerves

**Speaker D (reading for caller):** A caller asks about atrophy related to a pinched nerve in the neck. Any dietary advice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are several things hormonally and nutritionally related to a pinched nerve. One of the most common situations is swelling of the sheath or membrane around the nerve. It swells up—for example, in a thyroid deficiency or estrogen excess—and the water makes the sheath compress the nerve.

If it's in a neck joint where cartilage might be softened because of hypothyroidism, the disc can spread out and push on the spinal cord. All connective tissues tend to swell up with high estrogen or low thyroid.

In dogs and horses, they found that spinal nerve compression and paralysis were caused by a copper deficiency. Keeping horses indoors eating dry hay contributed to this. The absence of light makes your respiratory enzymes lose necessary copper. The combination of darkness and copper deficiency causes an energy failure, leading to swelling of the connective tissues and pinching of the nerves.

**Andrew Murray:** So check the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The medical community relies on TSH measurement, but TSH itself is the cause of many symptoms blamed on low thyroid. When your hormone is low, TSH is high. TSH has pro-inflammatory actions that increase fibrinogen in your blood, making it more viscous and prone to clotting. It's best to have your TSH at the low end of normal. One study found that a population with TSH below 0.4 had the lowest incidence of thyroid cancer.

## Salt, Edema, and Pregnancy Toxemia

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How does salt play a part in relieving edema and the leak of water from the blood into surrounding tissues?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salt has direct effects on the mitochondria, increasing energy production and shifting the balance to produce more carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide helps retain as much sodium as you need. Without sodium or thyroid, you tend to produce more lactic acid, displacing carbon dioxide and causing inflammation and water retention.

Many doctors insist that more salt causes water retention and high blood pressure. However, David McCarron was the first medical person to point out that it's a calcium deficiency rather than a sodium excess that accounts for high blood pressure related to nutrition.

**Andrew Murray:** They used to give troops salt tablets in hot places like North Africa and India.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Increasing sodium intake tends to stabilize blood sugar because it works with thyroid to improve energy efficiency. It also lowers adrenaline, making your system work more efficiently, and prevents hyperventilation.

## Caller: Isosorbide and Heart Health

**Caller:** Do you know of an herbal supplement for Isosorbide? It's a time-release nitroglycerin for my heart.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nitroglycerin increases your nitric oxide, which is an age-accelerating free radical. That's the worst thing about it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** As far as herbs for the heart, Hawthorne is helpful, but there is no direct herbal nitroglycerin.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding coronary artery occlusion, what is the main way people can help themselves avoid blocked arteries?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eating enough calcium is protective of the circulatory system and prevents hardening of the arteries. The parathyroid hormone rises when you don't eat enough calcium or eat too much phosphorus (found in meat, beans, and wheat germ). Vitamin K is also very powerful at preventing calcification of the arteries.

## Caller: Diabetes Advice

**Speaker D (reading for caller):** A newly diagnosed diabetic would like quick nutrient and dietary advice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of my articles on the website explain why you shouldn't be panicked into avoiding sugar. Polyunsaturated fats are the best-documented cause of diabetes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So avoid liquid vegetable oils, oily fish, and poultry fat. Switch to saturated fats like butter, coconut oil, and beef.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Glucose stimulates the regeneration of the beta cells in the pancreas.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The polyunsaturated fats poison the pancreatic beta cells from producing insulin. Once those are removed, the cells can recover.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time. Dr. Peat's website is [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). There are many well-referenced articles there. Dr. Peat, do you have any final words?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I should mention the work of Uffe Ravnskov, a doctor who researched the role of saturated fats and showed that there's no basis whatsoever for the cholesterol scare.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much, Dr. Peat, for your time and expertise. We will be back the third Friday of August. Good night.
