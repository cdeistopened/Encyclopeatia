## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbs, supplements, and nutritional counseling.

This month, we are very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat’s expertise on the show. He offers a counterculture scientific viewpoint—not mainstream and not even naturopathic. His information is rooted in firm science, some of which has been largely ignored and shelved in favor of new drug treatments because we all know that new drug treatments are hugely profitable and not always beneficial.

For those listening, Dr. Peat has an extensive list of fully referenced scientific articles on his website, raypeat.com. They cover many different conditions and can illuminate the research done back in the 50s and 60s, brought into a 21st-century appreciation.

This month's discussion is on alternative approaches to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is an extremely crippling and debilitating condition that affects approximately 30 million people in the US. To use the term "arthritis," we first need to differentiate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from osteoarthritis (OA).

Osteoarthritis implies a type of joint disease that results from the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. Typical visual clues in the skeleton of the hand include masses on the knuckle joints called Bouchard's nodes, and swellings on the fingertips referred to as Heberden's nodes. The inflammation is typically not red or hot, and the underlying cartilage is lost with the bone underneath affected by wear and tear.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-lasting autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints, resulting in warm, swollen, painful joints, and stiffness often worse following rest. Commonly the wrists and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. There can be systemic involvement, affecting red blood cell count, causing pleurisy in the lungs, or pericarditis around the heart.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you can look at osteoarthritis as just a wear-and-tear breakdown of the joint with years of use, and rheumatoid as an autoimmune condition where the body is attacking itself.

**Andrew Murray:** RA is three times more common in smokers than non-smokers, and Vitamin D deficiency is more common in people with RA than in the general population. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, thank you.

## Estrogen, Progesterone, and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, we’ve mentioned the failed war on cancer, and the war on rheumatism seems similarly lost. Modern treatments like methotrexate are toxic and not very holistic. How do you see rheumatoid arthritis being produced, and what are your viewpoints on it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First of all, I don't make a clear distinction between any kind of arthritis, or even between heart failure, atherosclerosis, and various degenerative diseases. The interesting thing is to explain how a few basic metabolic problems have these very different-looking expressions. The really interesting research over the last 30 years has been in showing how inflammation relates to metabolism.

In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, many years ago I knew two women who were completely disabled with huge swollen knee joints and hands they couldn't use. The condition developed when they started taking estrogen. One was only in her 30s. Her doctor told her she needed to increase the dose of estrogen because of the deep belief that estrogen is protective against almost everything. She was getting worse and finally decided to stop it. She experienced total relief and clearing of the swellings. The other woman had a similar experience—recovery within a week or two of stopping estrogen.

Later, I saw a man about 48 years old. Every afternoon his knee would swell up hugely, and during the night it would get better. Remembering the women who recovered when they stopped estrogen, I thought he might have the same imbalance. I got him a bottle of 500 milligrams of injectable progesterone, which he applied topically to his leg. About two hours later, the inflammation was down. It didn't return the next day. I saw him 40 years later, and he was just starting to get knee inflammation again.

I was convinced that estrogen had a central role and that progesterone could be more curative than cortisol. Glucocorticoids are the main popular treatment, but people end up using them for years, and a main side effect is loss of bone density.

**Andrew Murray:** That's not what you want.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Rheumatoid arthritis, which tends to involve overgrowth of the bone around the joint, eventually shades over into breaking of the bones from osteoporosis. I started reading about osteoarthritis and saw studies published in books—not medical journals—making a clear association between estrogen and osteoarthritis. Even though journals consistently say osteoarthritis is caused by estrogen deficiency, looking at the research on what activates the osteoclasts that cause bone breakdown, endotoxin is a major activator.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that would have a role to play in both osteoarthritis as well as osteoporosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and in all of the degenerative diseases. Once you start having endotoxin absorbed in your system, you begin overproducing nitric oxide and prostaglandins.

## Endotoxin and Metabolic Stress

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, can you recap where endotoxin mostly comes from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is produced by bacteria. It is a combination of fatty acids and carbohydrate called lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the main source is from the intestinal tract?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the intestinal bacteria are always producing it. We absorb a little bit all the time, and it acts as a stimulant to the immune system. In everyday life, a small amount doesn't have a harmful effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This is why you're a proponent of raw carrots, because they help to protect against some of that absorption of endotoxin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The bactericidal effect of the carrot suppresses the growth of the bacteria, and the fiber absorbs and stimulates excretion.

**Andrew Murray:** So even in a healthy person, this lipopolysaccharide is still going to be produced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there is always a little getting into the liver and seeping into the general bloodstream. But when liver function slows down, it massively gets past the liver barriers and starts poisoning your systems, increasing nitric oxide and drastically lowering oxygen metabolism.

This is where endotoxin and estrogen come together. They both interfere with the metabolic use of oxygen and turn on glycolysis—turning sugar into lactic acid. The more irritated a tissue is, the more reduced it is, meaning it has an electron excess. This shifts everything through that tissue and eventually the whole organism.

**Andrew Murray:** This is the excitotoxic stage where these electrons need to be quenched?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The concept of "reductive stress" is now pretty well established. Fifty years ago, everyone was thinking about oxidative stress, but the degenerative processes are exactly the opposite: not enough oxygen, too much reduction. Estrogen and endotoxin shift us over to the glycolytic, lactic acid-producing condition. Since we can't oxidize glucose, we are forced to oxidize fats. That is very inefficient and leads to lipid peroxidation and the increased production of prostaglandins.

**Andrew Murray:** Which are mediators of pain and inflammation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If our bodies are loaded with polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)—which we don't want—that tends to increase steadily with aging. As a person increases their stores of polyunsaturated fats, every little stress becomes more reductive and more inflammatory. The prostaglandins act to amplify any little stress.

## Systemic Effects: Thyroid and Autoimmunity

**Andrew Murray:** How else do you see the energetic aspect of rheumatoid arthritis manifesting in systemic conditions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thyroid and pituitary systems are affected by the processes of the intestine and the failing organ. An inflamed knee, for example, leaks substances. A weak cell leaks proteins. When a cell is under stress, "stress proteins"—including heat shock proteins and glucose-regulated proteins—are activated. These leak out because of the cell structure being loosened by inflammation. They become immunogenic.

**Andrew Murray:** Right, they act as a stress signal to the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is where, even before there are signs of swollen joints, people can detect the rheumatoid factor antibody.

**Andrew Murray:** I think 70% of rheumatoid sufferers have it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see it as a sign of stress that isn't being handled. The thyroid responds to the same stress signals that the local connective tissue responds to. Nitric oxide goes up in the organism, shifting the brain and pituitary to increase Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) while blocking the thyroid gland's ability to produce the hormone.

Even within the "normal" range of TSH, the upper part of the range is associated with an increased risk of death from cancer and heart disease. You want to keep your TSH low because it is a factor that promotes inflammation—specifically tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1 and 6, and the rheumatoid swelling.

**Andrew Murray:** And the antibodies defined as thyroid-specific antibodies turn out to be joint-specific as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The thyroglobulin-specific enzyme is also specific for joint tissue. The known atherosclerosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis doesn't seem to involve an attack on blood vessels by antibodies, but rather something going wrong in the whole organism causing simultaneous degeneration.

This supports the Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger approach to the immune system. Cunliffe's idea is that the primary function of the immune system is the maintenance of order. When something goes wrong, the immune response is a cleanup process. I don't think you need a specific virus or bacteria to explain RA; when you have an energetically precarious tissue condition, any little cause can tip it over the edge into uncontrolled degeneration.

## Fertility and Longevity

**Caller:** I listened to a 2013 recording where you mentioned it's beneficial for women to have their monthly menstrual cycles throughout their entire lives. Why is lifelong fertility beneficial, and what do women need to do to achieve that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Rheumatoid arthritis frequently completely resolves during pregnancy and returns afterward. I think it's the huge production of progesterone that the placenta takes over during pregnancy. In both animals and humans, the number of pregnancies correlates with longevity.

From puberty on, there is a steady increase in the risk of dying. I think that is the estrogen risk factor. When the organism detects a threatening environment, it turns on the reproductive apparatus. When that apparatus works efficiently, it produces huge amounts of progesterone that have a life-protecting, anti-inflammatory effect. If estrogen isn't adequately compensated—due to low thyroid or toxins—then estrogen cyclically produces damage and accelerates aging.

What shuts the cycle off is the failure to produce enough progesterone. At menopause, even though estrogen decreases, the inflammatory factors lead to degeneration because they persist in the absence of progesterone.

## Infectious Arthritis and Berberine

**Andrew Murray:** Older texts mention arthritis associated with mumps, leprosy, or tuberculosis. Do you have experience with berberine or berberis-containing herbs (like Oregon Grape or Goldenseal) regarding their antimicrobial activity and effect on RA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't have experience with berberine specifically, though I've eaten Oregon grapes as jelly. However, my first thought is that berberine likely blocks nitric oxide. Infections increase nitric oxide and impair oxidative energy production.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And if berberine-containing herbs are antibacterial, they would stop the bacteria in the intestines from making the endotoxin that poisons the system.

## Vitamin D2 vs. D3 and Weight Loss

**Caller:** Why do stores sell Vitamin D3 and not D2? My doctor prescribed D2, but I noticed when I took D3, my hunger patterns changed and I lost weight.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around 1970, publications argued that D2 contributed to atherosclerosis and calcification of blood vessels. Milk producers shifted from D2 to D3 based on that.

Regarding weight loss, both calcium and Vitamin D suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH). Lowering PTH reduces inflammation. Reduced inflammation goes with a more efficient, higher rate of metabolism, keeping weight gain down and stopping the production of fat from protein and sugar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You want to monitor your levels. A reference range of 50 to 75 is good. It takes about eight weeks to reach a plateau level before you should test.

## Diabetes and Beta Cell Regeneration

**Caller:** I am diabetic, likely Type 1. I read that the pancreatic beta cells die. Is it possible to wake them up or regenerate them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Beta cells are always tending to regenerate, but they die quickly when you have diabetes. The factor that seems to kill them as they are being reborn is lipid peroxidation. Getting your polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) down is key.

Glucose happens to be the thing that maintains the constant regeneration of the beta cells. Keeping metabolism under control so you aren't degenerating PUFAs into lipid peroxides is the thing to keep in mind.

**Caller:** Is aspirin helpful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, aspirin improves insulin sensitivity. However, if you take aspirin chronically, ensure your Vitamin K is adequate, as aspirin can lead to a bleeding syndrome if K is deficient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For one 325mg aspirin, you'd want to take one milligram of Vitamin K2.

## Thyroid Hormones: T3, T4, and Reverse T3

**Caller:** Does T3 affect TSH?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Normally T4 suppresses TSH because the pituitary converts T4 to T3 locally. But if you get enough T3 into your brain and pituitary, it is at least as effective as T4.

**Caller:** What about Reverse T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reverse T3 partly occupies the same response site that active T3 would, simply competing against it. Local enzymes can eliminate Reverse T3, but if those are blocked by stress substances, Reverse T3 can accumulate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why taking temperatures and pulses will tell you if you're getting enough T3 or converting T4 properly.

## Exercise and Probiotics

**Caller:** I have two questions. Is endotoxin related to probiotics—are they good or bad? And how much exercise is too much?

**Andrew Murray:** Any exercise that makes you out of breath is not good. Gentle, moderate, weight-bearing exercise is ideal. You don't want to go into anaerobic respiration and produce lactic acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding probiotics, usually they are helpful, but not always. It depends on the particular species and the individual. Some people get worse when they take certain prebiotics or probiotics. You should judge by how you feel.

## Longevity and Childbearing

**Caller:** I heard you say having more babies prolongs life. But historically, women died in childbirth often. The Taj Mahal builder's wife died having her 14th child.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a study in Hungary around the late 1960s that looked at the whole population over a lifetime. They graphed the number of babies and the age of death of the mothers. It showed a smooth, straight increase in longevity with the number of babies, up to eight.

**Andrew Murray:** We have to hold it there. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for your time and knowledge.
