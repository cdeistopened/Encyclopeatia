## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome back to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. Every month we have a guest speaker, and that guest speaker is the faithful, ever-reliable, factual, and informative Dr. Raymond Peat. This month is no exception. Dr. Peat is going to be joining us to discuss the continuing subject of cancer with reference to autoimmunity and estrogen.

It is a live show, so we encourage questions related to the subject, but we recognize there are instances where people are following protocols and have questions related to that or other subjects. Dr. Peat is a wealth of information and often has answers for many different questions outside his specific area of expertise.

This month is a continuation of a broader discussion on cancer and alternative approaches to treatment. I found some new research from 2019 and 2020 papers written on immunotherapy, estrogen, and autoimmunity. Let's make sure we've got Dr. Peat on the air. Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. For those people who perhaps might not have read anything you've written or heard you speak, would you explain your academic and professional background before we get into the show?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I graduated from college, it was in the humanities. I was an English major for a while, then art, psychology, and philosophy. I worked for several years in the humanities, but I was specializing in linguistics and wanted to understand how language works in the brain. I decided to study biology to better understand the brain so I could understand language as a basis for understanding culture and humanities.

But when I got to graduate school at the University of Oregon in 1968, I learned that the brain scientists were the most dogmatic. Well, the geneticists were more dogmatic, but the brain science people were high status and very dogmatic. So, I looked around for people oriented towards science rather than dogmatism and found that reproductive physiology people were actually doing research and not throwing away evidence that contradicted their basic ideas.

I specialized in the physiology of oxidative metabolism as it changes in the reproductive system with aging. That happened to provide a good perspective on how to understand the brain and its energy, so it was useful for my original project. Then I wrote *Mind and Tissue*, a little book about the history of people understanding brain metabolism in relation to psychology. For 10 or 20 years, I specialized in the interactions of hormones and nutrition, counseling people on the effects of living and eating on their hormonal system and aging.

**Andrew Murray:** You said that the reproductive physiology people were far less likely to throw away good information related to research and were a little bit more careful in sticking to scientific principles. Is this because the estrogen industry hadn't really gotten so much traction at this point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My brain nerve biology professor described doing some research in class, and he said, "And then you throw away the bad data." In the lab, I would point out an instrument reading to him that was impossible by his ideas, and it just turned off his brain in a flash. He turned away. I'm sure his memory was that he never saw that happen.

## Estrogen, Autoimmunity, and Genetic Instability

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the subject of tonight: estrogen, autoimmunity, and cancer. I want to read a paragraph from a 2021 university paper. It says:

> "Why women are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases is not completely clear, but new data suggests that the hormone estrogen may play an important role. A new study now shows that estrogen activates the expression of AID (activation-induced deaminase), which is a protein that drives antibody diversification by deaminating cytosine in DNA to uracil. If estrogen increases the level of AID, increased mutations could transform benign antibodies into anti-self pariahs. AID might also contribute to cancer, particularly in breast tissue which is highly responsive to estrogen, by introducing mutations and strand breaks into the genome."

I wanted to read that because you mentioned you were looking into how estrogen unfavorably influences the immune system to become a self-destructive mechanism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That article you cited is an extremely important landmark. One of the very earliest estrogen-cancer researchers, Leonell Strong, showed that estrogen destabilizes the whole genome. It promotes a tendency to develop an uneven number of chromosomes by losing or gaining an extra chromosome. It's a genetic destabilizer. That is exactly what this article focuses on—one single enzyme which, when it functions, helps to produce the essentially infinite variety of antibodies we can make by creating an extreme rate of mutation locally.

But that same destabilizing process works on many levels, all the way to the shape and function of the basic cell, not just that one mutation-promoting enzyme. It is important to keep in mind that in between the big landmarks—like that article on the AID mutagenic enzyme—you have an almost continuous, seamless bunch of other changes that estrogen is producing that all tend in the same direction.

The reductionist, mechanistic approach just can't look at the fact that wherever you look, probably thousands of different places are cooperating with that destabilizing effect. Increasing the water content of the cell, for example, helps to destabilize the whole system. Hardening collagen, lowering oxygen tension, increasing nitric oxide production, histamine production... it would take about an hour just to identify the main pro-inflammatory mechanisms that have been identified. The interesting thing is it's holistic, almost seamlessly interacting, one factor supporting another.

**Andrew Murray:** I was so happy to find that article. I could hardly believe what I was reading because researchers and scientists were actually disclosing this now. It's been buried and hidden for so long because the estrogen industry is so powerful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've often wondered how my thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, came to be so open to the facts and resistant to the industry position. I think it was partly that he was born and educated before the power of the industry took over. He was aware of the research done in the 1930s that absolutely contradicted everything the estrogen industry has foisted onto the public since 1944.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you see estrogen driving autoimmunity in terms of what you're currently seeing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pro-inflammatory part of inflammation and immunity that is activated by estrogen—such as histamine, nitric oxide, and serotonin—is an essential part of getting things started. But the next step is to turn off the excitatory process that got things started and focus on maturing the cells. Once they get shaken up by a little inflammation, you have to give form to it.

Estrogen, by releasing histamine, activates many other pro-inflammatory things. It activates cells, gets cell division going, and increases the production of antibodies. The B cells are activated by estrogen. The thymus gland shrinks very quickly in the presence of either estrogen or glucocorticoids (steroids). If you knock out the thymus T cells that restrain antibody production, things like this enzyme you just cited (AID) become more and more dominant.

The B cells, being activated in many ways by estrogen—including knocking out the restraint from the T cells—create varied, sort of random, irrational activity of the antibodies being produced. In that relatively random activity, that's where some of the antibodies cause damage rather than contributing to cleaning up the infection process.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So what goes wrong? If estrogen is an important stimulator of inflammation for healing purposes, at what point does it go wrong?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's exactly the same thing that happens in pregnancy. Estrogen and histamine create a little focus of activity and inflammation in the uterus that the conceptus takes advantage of to get into the uterus. But then, if that process of local inflammation kept dominating, it would interfere with the oxygen and glucose supply to the fetus. You've got to stop the excitation and the inflammation before the pregnancy can really start by delivering glucose and oxygen to the tissue.

It is progesterone rising that does this. One of the natural functions of estrogen is to evoke the progesterone receptor, making the cells open to being turned off by progesterone. It's sort of an automatic process. The estrogen should excite and inflame the tissue, but immediately turn the tissue towards looking for relief from progesterone.

If you can produce progesterone, one of its first effects is to knock out the estrogen in roughly ten different ways. It turns off the production of estrogen, knocks out the estrogen receptor so the tissue is less sensitive, and changes the metabolism. That is exactly what happens to make pregnancy possible, and it is what happens every time you have a little injury that evokes the estrogen-activated start of the healing process.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For women that have autoimmune conditions, is progesterone something you would recommend to help combat the inflammatory, overactive immune-stimulating effects of estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. People are now recognizing the role of progesterone along with DHEA and thyroid. Over the last 50 years or so, I've seen several women with seriously debilitating effects of Lupus (SLE) where, just by taking thyroid and progesterone, all of their symptoms faded away over several weeks.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the thyroid is combating the estrogen, helping improve the liver's ability to excrete and detoxify it, and increasing oxygen to the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and making more progesterone.

## Environmental Estrogens and Plastics

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What role do plastics in our environment play in stimulating estrogens? Is this something that we're now going to be permanently scarred with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Birth control pills getting into the sewage means much of it ends up in the water of rivers and recycles. There are natural sources of estrogens, but the tremendous flow of estrogen down the sewers is a huge polluting source. But regarding plastics: the agents used to make stiff plastics more flexible are effective estrogens in very small amounts, and all of the water supply of the world is contaminated with those.

**Andrew Murray:** One of the questions I was going to pose to you is around Bisphenol A (BPA) and the catastrophe that we're seeing worldwide with environmental contaminants from the plastics industry. It is fueling cancer rates worldwide because it's directly implicated in the estrogenization of the organism.

Let's take our first caller.

## Caller: Plastics and Pharma Collusion

**Caller (Joe from Squirrel Ridge):** I was wondering if there's a correlation between the plastics makers and the pharmaceutical industry?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a known fact that the Roundup company also holds the patents to the medicine that cures the same illness—or pretends to cure the symptoms of the illness—that the dandelion root would cure.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about petrochemical and pharmaceutical collusion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are the most powerful industries next to the military arms industry. They have had control of the government regulatory agencies for well over 100 years. The asbestos industry was less powerful compared to pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals, yet it took about 100 years to reduce the public's exposure to carcinogenic levels of asbestos. So, the government is working against the public on matters of pollution.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Haven't you told us that estrogen is manufactured from petrochemical products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The original ones were Diethylstilbestrol (DES). It was so cheap. It was a perfect drug—cost nothing to manufacture but had very powerful estrogen-like effects. It was continuing to be used to treat prostate cancer right into the very end of the 20th century.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's what you believe causes prostate cancer, right? The estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That treatment was based on zero evidence. It was a total matter of opinion, contrary to all of the research in animals. But it affected many millions of men for about 55 years.

## Viral Theories and Autoimmunity

**Andrew Murray:** Back to autoimmunity. I've seen research suggesting oncogenetic viruses—like Epstein-Barr virus—are implicated in autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, and Sjögren's syndrome. Do you go along with that kind of theory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same inflammation that leads to the direct actions of estrogen on the T and B cells—and on their ability to make the safe type of antibodies—is affecting all of the cells of your body. Whatever the inflammation is, it shifts them a little bit to the unstable tendency to lack enough oxygen and take up more water than is desirable.

## Anti-Estrogenic Substances

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about Diindolylmethane (DIM) for anti-estrogenic purposes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were studies in fish in which it had a pro-estrogenic effect, so I've been a little skeptical of it. But to the extent that you can show in humans that it is protective, then it's a pretty safe material. Just eat your cabbage, broccoli, and kale.

**Andrew Murray:** I also saw a botanical called *Momordica charantia* (bitter melon). Studies say it has strong estrogen-modulating properties and reduced estrogen levels in rats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two factors that powerfully go with the inflammation and destabilizing effect of estrogen, adding to the tendency to develop autoimmunity. One is **endotoxin**. If you're overloaded with estrogen, your blood vessels tend to be leaky. That increases the risk of exposure to endotoxin, which intensifies that leakiness and affects all of your cells.

The other main factor is the **polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)** and the prostaglandins they are converted to. Free polyunsaturated fatty acids have a direct effect, activating estrogen—for example, knocking out the estrogen-binding protein so that the estrogen is freed to be more active. Under the influence of estrogen, the excitatory prostaglandins are activated. In a healthy situation, prostaglandins are blocked by progesterone in multiple ways. Once you shift over to the estrogen influence, you're at increased risk from the polyunsaturated fats and the endotoxin coming from your intestine.

**Andrew Murray:** I'm glad you mentioned endotoxin and leaky gut. I saw an article associating leaky gut with being the initial insult that allowed fragments to pass into the bloodstream and set up autoimmunity. They mentioned gliadin from gluten. Someone said the gliadin molecule was very similar to the T3 and T4 (thyroid) structure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Celiac disease has been increasing right along with the exposure to estrogen. It has gone from mostly a childhood disease to mostly in adult women. There are several things that overlap antigenically with the tissues under the influence of estrogen and gluten.

## Caller: Carcinogenic Foods

**Caller:** What are three categories of foods one can avoid that are highly carcinogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
1.  **Polyunsaturated fats:** Any vegetable seed oil.
2.  **Pro-inflammatory amino acids:** Tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine. This means high-quality proteins in excess. You don't want to eat a pound or a pound and a half of meat per day.
3.  **Excess Iron:** Anything that contains a very great excess of iron.

**Caller:** How does a diet rich in PUFAs compare in cancer risk to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** PUFA is probably the biggest carcinogenic part of the American diet.

## Caller: Whole Wheat and Chicken

**Caller:** Does whole wheat flour fall under carcinogenic foods? And is chicken healthy to eat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason flour and grains were polished—like white rice and white flour—is that the whole grains get rancid and toxic fairly quickly in storage. If you're going to eat the whole wheat flour soon after it's ground, it's probably not so bad. But once it gets in your blood, those excess polyunsaturated fats start to react with iron in your blood to produce lipid peroxides and free radical toxins. The polished rice has very little nutritional value but avoids the worse effects of storage toxins.

Regarding chicken: On a typical industrial diet, chicken is full of very unstable polyunsaturated fats. I think in excess, it is pretty carcinogenic.

**Andrew Murray:** But if you had access to good, fresh, locally raised chicken from a free diet, no more than 4 ounces a day is okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. It's the same with pork. Industrial pork has over 30% PUFA in the fat. If people are careful what they feed their pigs—like the traditional pig diet of whey and old vegetables—the fat goes down almost like beef, to around 4% PUFA.

## Gluten and Estrogen Connection

**Andrew Murray:** Before we lose the train of thought, I wanted to make sure we got the connection between gluten and estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The enzyme transglutaminase is in common between gluten and the lining of the intestine acted upon by estrogen. If we have antibodies to the foreign protein gluten, they will act against our own tissues as far as they're under the influence of estrogen, which induces the transglutaminase. The transglutaminase aspect of estrogen is the cross-linking enzyme that hardens collagen. Under the influence of estrogen producing transglutaminase, collagen itself becomes hardened and carcinogenic rather than flexible.

## Caller: Seeds

**Caller:** What is your opinion on eating hemp seed and pumpkin seed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are not necessarily the worst for the PUFA, but I wouldn't say it's something that you should do regularly because of the breakdown products. They're probably fairly rancid by the time you ingest them anyway.

## Caller: Construction Materials

**Caller (Corey from Redway):** I'm a construction worker. I work with laminated glues, ABS glue, PVC, and insulation. I assume those are exuding the same kind of bio-estrogens you're referring to.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the safety law system, as far as it exists, is really part of a superstructure that enforces the use of dangerous materials. They have laws to supposedly protect you against them, but the basic system is designed to direct production towards these cheapest and most dangerous chemicals.

In the long run, I think the problem would be solved very economically by using different materials instead of continuing deforestation to make lumber and plywood. Living in Mexico, I was interested that there are practically no fire departments because the houses are all mud and cement. Mud and cement are very cheap building materials, they pollute very little, and are chemically inert once in place.

**Andrew Murray:** What are some dietary strategies if you've been working all day with these chemicals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any good fiber that isn't too poisonous. Carrots have their own poisons, but the fiber keeps us from absorbing toxins. When it's raw carrot and moderately shredded, we absorb very little of the irritating chemicals, but the fiber helps prevent the reabsorption of estrogen from the bowel.

Other fibers you might find more agreeable include well-cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots, or even well-cooked oat bran. That fiber effect gets the bile out of your intestine so it doesn't recycle and poison your liver. Keeping the intestine as clean as possible means keeping a rapid transit time and avoiding irritating foods that could cause inflammation and constipation.

Part of the effect is to watch that your thyroid isn't suppressed, because that will slow the elimination of estrogen. Keeping your metabolic rate up—keeping a temperature around 98.6°F during the peak of the daytime—will tend to give you quick peristalsis and get things through your intestine before they have a chance to irritate, produce endotoxin, and recycle estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And calcium is definitely one of them that helps to keep estrogen levels low, along with Vitamin D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because they keep your metabolic rate higher, the way thyroid does. Calcium, especially from low-fat milk supported by vitamin D, is very good for weight loss.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And lastly, progesterone is a direct combat molecule to estrogen.
