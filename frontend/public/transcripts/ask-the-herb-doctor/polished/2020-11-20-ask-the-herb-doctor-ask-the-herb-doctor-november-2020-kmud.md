## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** It is the third Friday of the month, and we typically have Dr. Raymond Peat on the show. He has been a stalwart here for the last 10 years or more. For the last five or six months, the COVID crisis has certainly been on the front burner. We've been discussing the facts surrounding protocols, the approach to it, and what it means to the general population.

This evening, we are going to be outlining some of the therapeutic advances and strategies to mitigate potential coronavirus infection. From 7:30 until the end of the show, you're invited to call in with any questions surrounding tonight's subject of strategies, herbs, and other compounds used to mitigate the inflammation associated with severe infection. The number is 707-923-3911.

We are very pleased to have Dr. Peat joining us to share his expertise and wisdom. Are you there, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for coming again. For those who have never listened to you, would you outline your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied and worked in the humanities for the first 10 years or so after college. Then I went back to school in biology for a PhD at the University of Oregon in 1972. Since then, I have been working on how the humanities—culture in general—interact with science. It continues to be very interesting that science is heavily influenced by the general background culture. Television, newspapers, as well as medical journals, have a strong influence on the way science is practiced.

## Media Dogma and Respiratory Therapeutics

**Andrew Murray:** The media is a very powerful weapon in terms of shaping people's consciousness. I know you've brought up the repeated dogma or straight-out lies through poor research that is continually propagated—for example, that fish oil is helpful, despite evidence to the contrary.

I want to run through some therapeutics and break them down in terms of their cellular activity. The main thrust of what we're discussing is anti-inflammatories and antihistamines working against the immune-modulated cytokines brought into play by viral and bacterial attacks.

Of the small percentage of the population exposed to the COVID-19 virus, an even smaller number have died, and in every case, it is the airway difficulty that has been the reason. Many ER doctor reports mirrored the report by Kyle Cameron-Sidell, an ER doctor from Brooklyn. He was treating critical care patients suffering from a cytokine storm and focused on the damage induced by the ventilators themselves. He said the disease resembled high-altitude sickness much more than viral pneumonia.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That recognition leads to the idea, which is backed by a lot of facts, that too much oxygen is creating the inflammation, making it worse instead of better.

**Andrew Murray:** You've always said that CO2 is a beneficial gas and that oxygen, counterintuitively, should be considered more of a poison.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Kyle Sidell mentioned that his patients were very low in CO2, and that's exactly what happens in mountain sickness or in ventilation sickness. Too much oxygen lowers your CO2. That creates a very powerful systemic inflammatory condition.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So would it have been better if they gave them a proper mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen instead of just pure oxygen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Those products are available already mixed: 5% CO2 and 95% oxygen, or slightly varying percentages.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if you were having difficulty breathing and you felt some relief from breathing in some passive oxygen, would you use that mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. In some high-altitude studies, they were putting people who were collapsing with mountain sickness into a big plastic or rubberized bag and zipping it shut, letting them breathe the relatively pure oxygen. It was helping, but someone noticed that the plastic bag was accumulating a high level of CO2 from their breathing. So they tried giving them a CO2 supplement instead of an oxygen bag, and that worked very effectively. It works in hospitals, too, to ventilate people with a supplement of around 5% CO2.

## Mucus, Inflammation, and Clotting

**Andrew Murray:** Inflammation seems to be the overriding mechanism of this form of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The mucus buildup reduces the capacity for oxygen diffusion. I want to explore compounds that act as agents to break down the bonds between the mucus or cause a watery secretion to thin the mucus.

You had mentioned a compound called bromhexine, which actually comes from an Ayurvedic plant named *Adhatoda vasica*. Dr. Peat, do you know much about *Adhatoda*?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bromhexine has been compared with guaifenesin as a mucolytic, and I think it was about twice as effective at breaking down and thinning viscous mucus. The mucus normally functions as a barrier against irritants and infective things. But when the inflammation of the tissue producing it becomes extreme, the osmolarity of the tissue increases; it dehydrates and concentrates, making the mucus much more viscous.

One of the functions of the mucus is not only to bind toxins from the outside, but to bind and carry away things like histamine produced by the inflamed tissue. If the inflammation leads to dehydrating the mucus, it becomes dense, accumulates the histamine that should be lost to the environment, and becomes a very powerful irritant and contraction-promoting agent, causing constriction of the small tubes of the breathing system.

This stress and inflammation to the lungs acts systemically because the lungs rival the liver in the detoxifying system. Infected people tend to have higher serotonin because the lungs are not detoxifying it. That leads to clotting. Traditionally, influenza was known to cause strokes and other blood clotting problems. That is currently being recognized with COVID, but it largely derives from the fact that irritated lungs don't detoxify histamine and serotonin, and the serotonin activates the clotting system.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting, because I'm going to get into some herbs that are platelet activation factor (PAF) blocking agents.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Things like ginkgo and feverfew would be PAF blockers.

## Mucolytics and Expectorants

**Andrew Murray:** We want to look at agents that improve the breakdown of mucus or improve the mucociliary escalator—the little hairs wafting foreign objects out of the trachea. I want to start with quercetin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's one of the reasons I recommend fruits, especially citrus fruit. It works with the sugar content of fruits as well as other anti-inflammatory things. Sugar itself can be mucolytic. It quiets the inflammation in a variety of ways and lowers the stress hormones.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And isn't that how cortisone shots work when you have lung disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it raises your serum glucose.

**Andrew Murray:** Quercetin is found in citrus fruits and dark berries like blackberries, blueberries, and bilberries.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And nettle leaf is very high in quercetin.

**Andrew Murray:** Moving on to expectorants—things that increase thin watery production to be wafted up by the mucociliary escalator. I want to mention elecampane. It is a tall perennial herb in the Compositae family containing volatile oils. It has long been used as a warming expectorant.

That brings me to licorice. Licorice comes up time and time again in research concerning COVID. It contains glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid, which exhibit a mineralocorticoid, aldosterone-like action. Dr. Peat, there is a controversy where practitioners of herbal medicine were always anti-steroids. The Framingham study showed that elevated aldosterone was positively associated with new-onset hypertension. How do you distinguish the positive steroidal effects from the negative effects in licorice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tissues that are most involved in inflammation happen to have taste receptors. Bitter herbs and sweet things like licorice have signaling effects to activate some of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. I think that's how licorice can act on our system to inhibit histamine and serotonin.

However, in large amounts, it increases the tendency towards hypertension. The steroid inhibits an enzyme that prevents the accumulation of too much mineralocorticoid, such as aldosterone. Aldosterone itself is a major promoter of degenerative inflammation. That's one of the reasons that I think progesterone is a better anti-inflammatory, except maybe for one or two days of acute lung inflammation where dexamethasone is probably quicker. For prolonged use, progesterone supports the cortisol-like anti-inflammatory effect but has a powerful anti-aldosterone effect, preventing the increase of blood pressure and blocking the fibrosis-producing effects of aldosterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So something like our thyme and licorice syrup is not something we'd want people to be on at high doses for a long time, but in an acute situation for a short period to get over a chest infection, it is anti-inflammatory enough to help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think one of the effects of just sugary things like orange juice is that it too activates those sugar taste receptors.

## Caller Questions: Herbal Remedies

**Caller (Caller 1):** I believe in herbs. In this pandemic, I found that Goldenseal and Echinacea—1,000 milligrams—is the best anti-inflammatory. I used to use it in college in San Francisco for the bad weather to get up early with energy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yes, Goldenseal is very good to help regulate normal mucus production of your mucous membranes, and Echinacea is also very anti-inflammatory for the immune system.

**Caller (Caller 2):** I'm from Fort Bragg. I have a big polyp in my right nostril and my sinuses are infected all the way up into my head. It comes out in ropes of mucus. I also have fibromyalgia and mold in my carpet. I can't take licorice.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Goldenseal would be very good for you.

**Caller (Caller 2):** I've been doing that.

**Andrew Murray:** It sounds like a sinus infection is your most important issue. We have a formula based on sinus herbs like Goldenseal and Horseradish root, which is excellent for disinfecting nasal passages.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It also has chili and plantain. Those are both mucolytics that help dissolve mucus secretions and disinfect them.

**Andrew Murray:** I also want to mention onion syrup. It is a simple remedy you can try at home. Cut an onion into 1/8th-inch slices, set them on a saucer, and cover them with honey. Let the honey pull out the actives—which are soft sulfur-containing products—and take that internally. It is excreted through the respiratory tract and will have an effect on your sinuses. Fresh horseradish is also a good alternative.

## Caller Questions: Pregnenolone and Aging

**Caller (Ali):** I am in my 20s but aging prematurely. I wanted to ask Dr. Peat about the "facelift effect" from pregnenolone. Is that a common occurrence? Also, how do I determine the safety of pregnenolone? I've heard reports of women developing facial hair.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Developing facial hair is from very impure products. In recent years, I've been hearing all kinds of symptoms associated with using it. I think it's mostly from small Chinese factories that don't know how to purify it. They are getting symptoms like breast pain and uterine contractions, showing an estrogen-like effect as well as possibly the androgen-like effect.

When pregnenolone is pure, if a person is healthy, they can take a cupful of it with no noticeable effect. All it does is lower the stress hormones. Until you're about 45 years old, you usually don't feel anything from pure pregnenolone. So all of these symptoms being talked about on the internet are evidence that there's a lot of very impure pregnenolone going around.

**Caller (Ali):** Is there a way to determine if it is safe? Should I get the batch tested?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It costs thousands of dollars to have a good test.

**Andrew Murray:** I fairly regularly send off pregnenolone to be assayed by gas chromatography. The test is about $250.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They should look for a very small peak for estrogen or other steroids because one part per thousand, if it's estrogen, can have very powerful effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The caller is asking about the facelift effect. What dose would be safe for a 20-year-old?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's safe in any amount. It was tested on rats in the early 1950s, and the equivalent of a cupful had no effects. I took 3,000 or 4,000 milligrams every day just to test for side effects. Many people in their 20s and 30s wanted to try it, and none could feel the slightest effect. But people in their late 40s and 50s are the ones who experience an overnight tightening up of their loose skin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So do you think a 20-year-old would benefit from it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, at that age, it is very unlikely.

**Caller (Ali):** I took maybe 50 milligrams years ago and it made me very sleepy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does lower cortisol if that is abnormally high.

## Caller Questions: Estrogen and Diet

**Caller (Caller 4):** Does chamomile tea reduce estrogen?

**Andrew Murray:** Its main use is a gut anti-inflammatory, but it does have apigenin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Apigenin is a known estrogen antagonist. So potentially, yes, it could be an estrogen-lowering, sedative, gastrointestinal calming herb.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Anything that makes your intestine happy is likely to reduce the estrogen effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would there be other herbal teas that have that effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think aspirin is the most practical general aromatase inhibitor.

**Andrew Murray:** Liver stimulants would speed up liver clearance, and bowel things like cascara would prevent reabsorption of bowel estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Lemon balm is also very calming on the gastrointestinal tract and might indirectly lower estrogen.

## Astragalus and Cytokines

**Andrew Murray:** I want to mention Astragalus. We use a lot of it. Studies in China show that it decreases inflammatory cytokines like Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin-8, and increases the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-10. It is one of those herbs used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as part of a formula for treating COVID.

## Caller Questions: Kidney Cancer Recovery & Humidifiers

**Caller (Caller 5):** What does Dr. Peat recommend for someone who has had kidney cancer surgically removed? What kind of diet? Also, is a eucalyptus humidifier good for colds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For the kidneys, watch for intestinal inflammatory symptoms because there are a lot of toxins that damage the kidneys that are formed only in the intestine. Keeping a clean intestine is the first requirement.

Keeping your energy up is essential for the immune system to work. That involves keeping your daytime temperature up to what used to be the normal: 98.6°F (37°C). That temperature is very important for preventing inflammation and increasing resistance to cancer and infections.

**Caller (Caller 5):** My mother has one kidney left. Should she stick with fruit and avoid meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of our natural hormones involved in kidney malfunction is parathyroid hormone (PTH). That lowers our systemic energy production and damages our immune system if elevated. The two things that will prevent excess production of PTH are a lot of calcium in the diet relative to phosphate, and an adequate intake of Vitamin D.

**Caller (Caller 5):** So milk is okay for her?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the safest thing. A very milk-rich diet, going relatively light on phosphate-rich foods like meat and beans. You need a certain amount of iron, so eggs are a good regular source that have a moderate amount of phosphate.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding humidification and volatile essential oils like eucalyptus: if someone has dry airways, using a humidifier is a good thing. Volatile oils contain terpenes which have antibacterial and antiviral effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Eucalyptus radiata is one of the nicest smelling eucalyptus essential oils to use in a humidifier.

## Caller Questions: Excessive Mucus

**Caller (Lily):** My husband has developed hyper-mucusness since last January. He acts like he's drowning in it at night. He had pneumonia last January. We are vegan. What about fenugreek?

**Andrew Murray:** Fenugreek is more for digestion and increasing breast milk production.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Has he tried mucolytic herbs like plantain or goldenseal? Also, cascara to keep his bowels moving.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the mild antiseptic fibrous foods such as raw carrot or cooked mushrooms or cooked bamboo shoots can help.

**Caller (Lily):** We've been vegan for 14 years, so he gets a lot of raw and cooked vegetables.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Raw lettuce is one of the most mucus-promoting inflammatory agents. Specifically, raw carrot can decrease a lot of mucus production if he has about a cup of raw carrot salad a day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But don't use any lettuce with it. Just straight grated carrot or really well-cooked mushrooms. They are fibers that inhibit microorganisms and inflammation in the intestine, which can help with the inflammation producing the mucus.

## Closing Thoughts and Additional Remedies

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time for calls. Dr. Peat's website is **raypeat.com**, which has fully referenced articles surrounding a wide variety of conditions. Our website is **westernbotanicalmedicine.com**.

I wanted to mention a few other things for treating excessive mucus. I mentioned onion syrup earlier. Another is a syrup made from coltsfoot flowers (*Tussilago farfara*) and marshmallow leaf. This works as a reflex demulcent in the gut to stimulate respiratory demulcents and thin watery secretions.

I also want to mention Frankincense. Boswellic acid is the substance responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect via the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. Boswellic acid binds to this enzyme and, instead of catalyzing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes, it causes the production of anti-inflammatory substances.

Finally, Woad root (*Isatis tinctoria*). It has antibiotic and antiviral activity, inhibits hemagglutinins in the blood, and inhibits viral neuraminidase.

And of course, aspirin. It is a very inexpensive, easy-to-get anti-inflammatory and antiviral with plenty of evidence showing it inhibits viral replication and works in acute lung injury.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you very much for listening.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you.
