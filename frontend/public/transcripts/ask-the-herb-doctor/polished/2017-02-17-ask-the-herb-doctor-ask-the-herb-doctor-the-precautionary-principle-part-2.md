## Introduction: The Precautionary Principle

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this evening's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed naturopathic doctors. We practice herbal medicine and nutritional counseling. This month I wanted to continue from last month's topic because we barely had time to get into the meat of it. Last month's topic was the precautionary principle. This is something that Dr. Peat was enlightening me to in terms of a directive in law in Europe, whereas that directive is not in place in the States.

To reiterate, the precautionary principle as applied to medicines and foods can be seen in Europe where it is codified into law, but purposely not here in the US. The World Charter for Nature, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982, was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle. The United States has opposed the use of the term "principle" because this term has special connotations in legal language; a principle of law is a source of law.

Later in the show, I want to explore the nature of Chris Busby's article and a recent article from Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass regarding whistleblowing on the dangers of the nuclear industry and the government control of data. Chris Busby's invocation of the Euratom suicide clause looks to pose a credible threat to the nuclear industry, and Dr. Sternglass's publications clearly show the reality that no radiation exposure is safe. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for giving your time. Could you briefly go through the process of the precautionary principle again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The principle is really nothing but saying that common sense should be incorporated into public policy—that it's better to be safe than sorry. It is hard to appreciate why that is so controversial, that you should know something about the probable effects of any action you take.

I was just reading about the first big hydrogen bomb test the US made in the Pacific. Some of the physicists working on it said they had calculated there was a certain probability that the bomb might start a chain reaction in the atmosphere and destroy the world. They went ahead with it because they said that was a small probability.

When they were designing the first hydrogen bomb to make a portable device, instead of having refrigerated hydrogen gas, they used lithium hydride or lithium deuteride as the source of the fusible deuterium. They calculated that they would get a 5-megaton explosion. It didn't occur to them that the lithium itself might undergo fission and provide more fusible material. In fact, that is what happened. The lithium itself entered into the nuclear reaction and produced a 15-megaton explosion—three times bigger than they calculated. It killed a fisherman, irradiated and sickened people on a Japanese fishing boat, and burned a lot of the sailors and military people watching it. They were so confident they were good engineers and physicists that they didn't even think about the simple physical chemistry involved.

That simple ignorance is something you have to take into account when working with anything dangerous. But far beyond that is the ulterior motive. If they have some big goal they are after, it isn't simply a matter of not investigating the dangers, but of actually falsifying the known probable effects. That is where the precautionary principle opens up something much bigger. The government has controlled scientific information so drastically over the last 60 or 70 years that even if you do try to apply the precautionary principle, without the information you need, it's impossible to take precautions that will save lives.

## Government Liability and Information Control

**Andrew Murray:** Because the precautionary principle does not apply in the States, does that give a wider doorway for these procedures rather than being held accountable financially for reparation through the courts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is one possible solution. If the information ever comes out that they really knew they were killing people, then they could be held responsible.

**Andrew Murray:** I think about vaccine-damaged children as a pretty recent revelation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Documents have come out that the insiders in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) knew the dangers and didn't want it made public.

**Andrew Murray:** So that is willful culpable damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The insiders knew the research showing the risks of vaccinations, just as they knew the risks of radiation. Not just risks—the actual cause of cancer, premature births, and brain damage. When they are finally forced to admit that there is some damage, they traditionally have falsified the quantities of toxins or the intensity of the damage to be expected. In the story that Chris Busby is telling, the government falsified the Hiroshima and Nagasaki damage—over a hundred-fold shrinkage of the actual damage produced over the years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this because the corporations are lobbying the government?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Or owning the government. The people working for the government are assured that if they do favors for the industry, they can quit their job in a few years and go to work for the corporations for ten times as much money. It's slightly delayed bribery.

**Andrew Murray:** How can we develop safe innovations without stifling progress or over-regulation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Information has to be available to the public, and that involves alternative scientific opinion being publishable. But the journals are controlled by the industry. For example, the interference by Monsanto with articles that have been critical—either stopping their publication or pressuring for the retraction of already published articles. In the case of health physics and radiation, the main journal, *Health Physics*, is really a house organ of the nuclear industry. The articles that are published are outrageously favorable to radiation, claiming that it's actually good for people to be irradiated.

**Andrew Murray:** So there is collusion between industry, government, and science. We have mentioned before that clinical trials are skewed and data is hidden.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You try to find something on YouTube and you can hardly find it because there are advertising sites that try to tell you what they want to tell you.

**Andrew Murray:** It is like what you have said about reading abstracts in the library. They started removing original research from the libraries, and now you have a hard time finding it on a web search because algorithms direct you elsewhere.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone seems to trust PubMed, but years ago, a librarian posted a notice for students to be aware that PubMed is not a science database. It is controlled by the government and military. I compared some articles that were listed in *Biological Abstracts* or *Chemical Abstracts* and then looked them up in *Index Medicus* or PubMed. The good articles were simply deleted. I would find a conventional, mainstream idea article right next to a very good article; the bad article would be listed in PubMed, and the good article wouldn't be.

**Andrew Murray:** Are *Biological Abstracts* and *Chemical Abstracts* searchable databases that anyone can look at?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are very expensive to use. If you get your library to subscribe and are a member of the library as staff or a student, that's the only practical way to get in.

## Nuclear Energy, Global Warming, and Disinformation

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to mention Chris Busby's Euratom clause report. It outlines the cover-up and misinformation tactics used by the government to hide the fact that the deaths of survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still ongoing, killing tens of thousands every year through cancers and genetic defects.

Regarding Dr. Ernest Sternglass, his work on "no exposure is the only safe approach" can be seen by searching "Nuclear Witness Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass." The UPI has stated there are skyrocketing cancer cases in Fukushima. The Times published that child cancers are up 5,000% in Fukushima. We also see a spike in animal deformities on the West Coast.

How can we continue to defend nuclear energy in the presence of technologies like clean coal, which were being shut down in light of it being a global warming issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you remember when the Three Mile Island reactor melted down? The public really started turning against nuclear energy because of the fear of a huge meltdown. Sternglass got in great trouble. The industry defamed him beginning even before that, around 1970. They started saying he was totally uninformed because he had the actual inside information showing that the government was under-declaring the amount of radiation being released by hundreds of millions of times.

The nuclear industry taught everyone who worked in it that people like Sternglass, Gofman, and Alice Stewart were simply incompetent fanatics. Even Linus Pauling was in trouble and ostracized by other chemists and physicists because of his opposition to testing bombs in the atmosphere.

**Andrew Murray:** Part of the Sternglass article mentioned the US Army's readiness to commit hundreds of underground explosions to create caverns to store natural gas.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That whole idea of "Atoms for Peace," such as digging canals and producing natural gas release, was knowingly fraudulent. They had the information right from the 1940s that small amounts of radiation caused infant deformities, stopped brain growth in utero, and caused birth defects. But for their own purposes—to be able to wage nuclear war—they promoted this idea that the bombs had a peaceful use.

Because of the public turning against nuclear power in 1978 as a result of Three Mile Island, a process started in the Pentagon where they had to come up with something more scary than nuclear power. Just at the beginning of 1980, shortly after Three Mile Island, they reversed a trend of predicting a new ice age. From the late 1940s until 1979, they were predicting planetary cooling. But the Pentagon and the CIA came up with this idea of planetary warming.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Or the nuclear power industry told them to do that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, the military too, because they need the nuclear power as a source of fuel for the bombs. So they invented planetary warming, totally reversing the preceding 30 years of climate study, as a way to say there is something worse than nuclear power. If we don't use this clean, cheap nuclear energy, we will overheat the planet.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And polar bears will die, and we won't take into consideration how many women, children, and men die from radiation poisoning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When Chernobyl exploded in 1986, the nuclear industry in this country insisted that only a few dozen people were killed. The Russians, who were best informed on the cleanup, calculated about 10 years ago that 985,000 premature deaths from cancer had already occurred from Chernobyl alone.

**Andrew Murray:** It seems analogous to the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) issue. You have been saying for decades that PUFAs are bad, oxidizable, and cause thyroid suppression. Only recently has that revelation become mainstream.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, my interest in that grew out of my interest in the radiation industry issue in the 1950s. Those are the fats that break down and become toxic under the influence of radiation. An excess of polyunsaturated fats produces the same kind of damage that radiation injury does. Estrogen and ionizing radiation synergize; each one produces the same sort of damage to the organism, and both of those converge on the polyunsaturated fats in the tissues.

## Caller: Laziness vs. Metabolic Health

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Caller (Bay Area):** I found that as my hypothyroidism and estrogen dominance improves, things are less overwhelming. For example, I used to get anxious with simple tasks like grocery shopping. Recently someone told me that I was using my health issues as an excuse for laziness. What are your thoughts on the concept of laziness? Interestingly, I'm the most productive when I feel very healthy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think I've ever run into anyone that had exactly that excuse.

**Andrew Murray:** I think what the caller was saying is that when you are metabolically deficient, it has a psychological effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you're metabolically healthy, then you're definitely the most productive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for quite a few years was said to be a personality issue. But that's something that can actually be measured metabolically and hormonally.

## Caller: Body Fat Percentage and Sleep

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller (Finland):** It is 3:00 AM here. I'm interested in two topics. First, is there an ideal body fat percentage to aim for? Second, what does science tell us about how much sleep we really need? Is it smart to sleep just once at night?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think body fat varies according to gender and age. For example, young women in their 20s and 30s who are overweight have a lower incidence of breast cancer than those who are underweight. One of the greatest increases in cancer is occurring among women between the ages of 25 and early 30s. Because of that relationship, it's better for a young woman to be on the plump side.

In older people, being somewhat leaner for women reduces the risk of breast cancer. However, in old people in general, mortality is lower with heavier body weight; they just have greater resistance to stresses. Same with increased cholesterol and a slight increase of blood pressure in old age—it is good.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think that body fat percentage would be? 20%? 24%?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a little higher.

**Andrew Murray:** How about 30%?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think 30% average.

**Andrew Murray:** And regarding sleep recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The timing and the quality of the sleep is the thing. Your blood sugar has to stay fairly steady and not drop too much during the night. Otherwise, the deep sleep is diminished. In a low thyroid person, they might spend eight or ten hours in bed semi-sleeping, but wake up feeling fatigued.

The level of blood sugar and metabolic rate are the main things that allow deep and restful sleep. The turnover of the brain tissue is very great during the night. That's one of the places where polyunsaturated fats in your thighs and abdomen are released into the bloodstream during the night, and whatever is in the bloodstream gets built into the brain structure. You want to keep your free fatty acids fairly low during the night by keeping your blood sugar up. Having carbohydrates close to bedtime protects the quality of sleep.

They've studied people with cirrhosis of the liver who did much better on all their tests if they had a fairly big dose of carbohydrate at bedtime. The breakdown that happens with aging primarily happens during the night. The calcium loss from the bones is essentially all in the morning urine because that's when the stress hormones rise.

**Andrew Murray:** So 10 hours is not too much sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but you probably don't need that much if it's efficient sleep. But I think it should be more than six hours for almost everyone.

**Andrew Murray:** I think the caller was thinking about the "Neanderthal sleep" pattern where humans used to go through two or three sleep cycles in a night.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the long winter, the night darkness would be stressful. If they wake up and have a lunch in the middle of the night, that replenishes their glycogen stores and makes the night much less stressful. Doctors used to be very negative about night eaters, but studies in the last five years show that it's very protective.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Haven't you said too, Dr. Peat, that no one should get up before 8:00 o'clock?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

## Night Shifts and Morning Stress

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I haven't ever met a night worker who is healthy.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about people doing night shifts and the imbalance of circadian rhythm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very bad for the health; it increases the cancer incidence. I think it's very important to avoid it when possible.

**Caller (Bay Area):** Sarah just mentioned that Dr. Peat said you shouldn't wake up before 8. Can you elaborate on that?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that because of cortisol levels that are very high at the early hours of the morning?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For example, people who would go for a jog first thing in the morning without eating—they looked at their blood cells, and the chromosomes in their white blood cells were broken. If they ate and then did their run, there was no chromosome damage. That same morning susceptibility to stress shows up in mortality; there's a morning peak in death from strokes and heart attacks. The blood is thicker in the morning and the cortisol is at its daytime peak. So people are relatively fragile in the morning.

## Analyzing Clinical Trials

**Andrew Murray:** Is there any easy way for people to find glaring mistakes in clinical trials, or is it completely sewn up by the companies doing the trials?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you think of propaganda analysis, when you're reading a science paper, you have to think about everything that they can do wrong. Sometimes I see a paper with fairly good conclusions in which they did everything wrong.

When you dissociate brain cells and put them in culture, or if you separate mitochondria and do techniques such as a patch clamp recording, there are things that have absolutely no physiological real meaning that are very customary in research papers. So you have to look for connections to what's happening in the real organism.

If you look at studies on animals, they can do things to the intact animal that you can't do to a person. But if you use, for example, a rodent with its night cycle and forget what time of day you're doing the experiment, they're stressed if you do experiments during the daytime when they normally would be sleeping. Typically someone with an ulterior motive will use exactly those tricks. Much of the estrogen industry is based on claims about estrogen and bone health based on rodents. They had been doing studies in dogs and found that estrogen damaged their bones. They gave up the dog studies and went to rodents because they could get opposite results.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, that's why we need you to help us sort out all this information.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat.
