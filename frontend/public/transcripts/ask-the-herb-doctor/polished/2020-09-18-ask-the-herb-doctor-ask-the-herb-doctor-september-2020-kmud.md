## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show this evening.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, we run every third Friday of the month. We are both registered medical herbalists; I graduated from England, and Sarah graduated from England with a master's degree in herbal medicine. We produce and manufacture extracts of different herbs that are used commonly in Europe as herbal medicines. We want to establish the truth in these monthly radio shows surrounding alternatives to regular medicines so people have alternatives to examine for themselves.

You are invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's continuing topic of COVID-19. Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us again. Before I go into the introduction for this month, would you just outline your professional and academic background for people listening who perhaps have not heard of you before?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From the University of Oregon, 1960, I got a master's degree in a humanities-related subject. Then in 1972, a PhD in biology concentrating on physiology, especially reproductive physiology in aging. Since 1972, I've been writing, studying, and doing some counseling.

**Andrew Murray:** For those listening, you can find out more at www.raypeat.com. There are lots of articles written by you and fully referenced.

## The Origins of COVID-19 and Genetic Engineering

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to preface the introduction for this month by saying that it's not for pointing the finger of blame, but for the freedom which knowledge can bring. The revelation this week of Dr. Li Meng Yan—an MD and PhD scientist working in the Hong Kong School of Public Health who has since fled to the US to escape persecution from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)—is basically that COVID-19 was engineered in the Wuhan laboratory.

It's not the first time this has been alluded to. It has been posited by Dr. Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winner for discovering HIV, that COVID has been genetically altered and has some elements of malaria and HIV in its genome. The National Biosafety Lab in Wuhan specializes in these different coronaviruses.

Dr. Peat, Dr. Luc Montagnier stated in an interview on French TV that the virus was clearly genetically altered. He is a Nobel Prize winner, not a conspiracy theorist. What do you think of the reference to those two diseases in the genome? Some people claim other coronaviruses naturally have elements of malaria and HIV in them. Do you see that as possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Naturally, when someone prominent like that points out how easy it is to engineer such a virus, people jump on it and say, "No, it isn't possible to create it in the lab." A couple of months earlier, when people were talking about it coming out of a germ warfare lab or being deliberately released, some of the people involved in working on the virus immediately published a paper in *Nature* claiming that it was impossible to create that particular virus in a lab.

However, I had been reading publications coming out of the University of North Carolina, the lab of Ralph Baric, for a long time. He was describing in detail the changes that they made in coronaviruses and other similar viruses, specifically how to make them more infectious to humans—changing an animal virus to a virus that would be infectious in humans. So Luc Montagnier simply applied his knowledge of virology and could quickly demonstrate the specific changes that had been made.

**Andrew Murray:** This is directly opposing the Geneva Convention, right? When they outlawed biological and other weapons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Richard Nixon closed the germ warfare lab in the United States in 1969, and there was a general treaty recognition around the world that no one would continue designing lethal viruses for military use. But they immediately started saying that just in case someone violates the convention and does produce one, we need to have a vaccine ready. So, they claimed they had to make these extremely dangerous viruses to practice making a vaccine.

Historically, for decades, people have been trying to make a vaccine against common cold viruses and never succeeded because the viruses change so fast. There were 200 virologists who signed a letter saying this is crazy because even with the best precautions, accidents happen. In fact, in the Fort Detrick lab, I think there were a thousand accidents identified which could have leaked toxic viruses into the environment. They happen every few days, even in these highest security labs.

If you're designing what they call "gain of function" research—taking a virus that never could infect mammals or humans—they find out what the viruses that *do* infect humans use to become infectious, and then they simply take the genes creating those proteins and insert them into some virus that produces the symptoms they want. It's very standard gene engineering. There's nothing impossible about making pretty much any DNA sequence you want.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't that why Dr. Fauci went to Wuhan in the first place? Because the US Government didn't want him doing that type of research and experiments here?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After those 200 virologists said there should be some serious thought given to this practice, there was a moratorium placed, and almost immediately Fauci transferred technology to Wuhan.

## Long-term Effects and Lung Inflammation

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If this COVID-19 was engineered in a lab in Wuhan and has gene sequences from AIDS and malaria, do you think there are going to be long-term consequences for people getting sick with it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has turned out to be slightly more infectious than a standard flu or cold virus, but not really much more harmful in the sense of killing people.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Could there be any long-term effect because they've altered this virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the things like influenza and coronaviruses that create serious respiratory disease create inflammation in the lungs and throughout the body. The clotting diseases that they have claimed are specific to coronavirus have been known for about 30 years regarding influenza; people after an attack of influenza are more likely to have a stroke, heart attacks, or other blood clotting events.

Inflammation in the lungs damages the lungs' ability to detoxify hormones. For example, almost all of the body's inflammation-creating serotonin travels from the intestine through the blood to the lungs. A little bit is detoxified in the liver, but most of it is destroyed in a healthy lung, stopping the inflammatory process that excess serotonin could cause. If you knock out your lungs' ability by inflaming them with influenza, then the serotonin goes on to cause vascular spasms, clots, and various kinds of inflammation throughout the body.

All of the strange things that have been blamed on coronavirus are simply the result of seriously inflamed lungs. For some reason, the standardized reaction imposed from above on hospitals was to quickly give respiratory pumping—slightly higher concentration oxygen directly into their lungs. When you accelerate breathing and increase oxygen delivery to the lungs, that in itself creates inflammation, reduces the lungs' ability to detoxify serotonin, and leads to all of the inflammatory things getting worse.

The extremely high mortality rate in the early weeks occurred when some hospitals were putting a tube into all of the COVID-diagnosed patients, resulting in 60% to 100% mortality. Nearby hospitals, where they had someone actually thinking about what's needed when you have inflamed lungs, had essentially zero mortality, showing that almost 100% of the mortality was caused by ignorant application of these respirators.

## Mortality Statistics

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In a bad flu year, like 2017, 88,000 people died of influenza. Now Worldometer says there are 203,000 deaths from coronavirus. But even Deborah Birx from the CDC said a percentage of those deaths are other types of influenza. When you say it's just slightly worse than a bad flu year, are you taking that into consideration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The instructions given for filling out death certificates meant there was really no clear definition of how to tell when someone is sick from the coronavirus or whether the coronavirus is simply incidental to some other cause of their pneumonia. By the instructions they were given, if there was evidence of the presence of a virus and the person died, you had to disregard that they died of a car accident, cancer, heart disease, or bacterial pneumonia. They were said to have died from coronavirus. It is absolutely unscientific and unmedical.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The CDC also came out with a statistic saying that 94% of COVID-19 fatalities had comorbidities—heart disease, diabetes, etc.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at the phony diagnosis of death causes, it looks like it might not even be as harmful as a standard influenza virus. It's hard to tell because there's no science being done. It's all political decisions. Normally, the CDC has taken two weeks to compile death figures. But the first few months of 2020 showed many fewer people dying from *all* causes in the US. Then, in mid-summer, the CDC went back and altered figures as far back as 25 weeks and raised the death figures so that they conformed to the usual preceding years. Until they did that historically unprecedented long-range revision, fewer deaths had occurred in the US than in a normal year.

## Call-in: Rotator Cuff Injuries and Surgery

**Caller (East Coast):** I have a question about a tear of a tendon. I know someone in his mid-60s with two rotator cuff tears—a partial tear and a full tear. The current technology for surgery is to incorporate a suture and a non-metal connector into the bone so it will reattach. Do you have any views on having a suture and a plastic piece inside you forever versus doing nothing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person is in perfect health when an unusual accident causes that rotator cuff injury, surgery has a pretty good chance of making a permanent repair because the tissues are strong and can tolerate the implanted materials. But usually, it happens when the person is in their 40s or 50s and is experiencing hormonal changes—increased stress hormones that weaken the connective tissues.

There are treatments such as platelet-rich plasma that will stimulate fibrous tissue growth, but the essential thing is to restore the hormonal balance that builds healthy connective tissue. You need to get the ratio of cortisol to the protective DHEA, testosterone, progesterone, and pregnenolone correct. Lowering the ratio of cortisol allows connective tissues to repair themselves rather than being weakened by stress hormones.

I've known people with shoulder, knee, and other connective tissue issues (like hernias) who, instead of implanting repair material, got their anti-stress system back. Sometimes just taking adequate amounts of Vitamin D will toughen up the connective tissues. Vitamin D works on the fascia, tendons, and ligaments as well as the bones.

**Caller:** They mentioned a cortisone shot would be good because the inflammation was obvious. You've discussed the negatives of cortisone. Would applying progesterone in a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio with DHEA on the location be an alternative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No anti-inflammatories are safer than cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids they use, which are even worse. Getting enough progesterone/DHEA into the tissue is the essential thing. Usually, these people have supplemented them orally as well as anointing the areas very thoroughly. You need to get the body level up to the point that your natural stress-induced cortisol isn't counteracting the healing process. Testosterone supplements can contribute if balanced with Vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and anti-inflammatories.

**Caller:** I'm concerned that if you're over 60, the conversion of DHEA to estrogen is a problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the reason for making sure that your Vitamin D, calcium intake, and thyroid hormone are all adequate to keep your estrogen under control so that you don't turn your DHEA and testosterone into estrogen.

**Caller:** If you have a tendon detached from the bone and don't reconnect it, how do you get recovery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a thing is immobilized and kept in proper relationship to the bone, regrowth is going to happen. Things spontaneously grow together.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I just want to add regarding DHEA and testosterone use: Dr. Peat usually recommends no more than 5 milligrams for a woman under 50, maybe up to 10 for a woman over 50, and for men, 10 to 20 milligrams. Taking a blood test to check your levels of estradiol when supplementing with DHEA is a good idea.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, even 10 milligrams a day can be far too much for someone who's hypothyroid or lacking Vitamin D.

## Whistleblowers and Dr. Li Meng Yan

**Andrew Murray:** I want to highlight another whistleblower, Dr. Li Meng Yan, a virologist in Hong Kong. She has blown the whistle online, stating categorically that the virus was manufactured. She was threatened to be silenced. She says the Chinese Communist Party is behind silencing this. This confirms what Luc Montagnier and Ralph Baric have revealed regarding the spike protein being altered.

## Call-in: Hydrogen Gas Inhalation

**Caller (Bruce):** What does Dr. Peat think of the inhalation of Brown's gas or hydrogen gas, or drinking it in infused water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Breathing hydrogen gas is anti-inflammatory. However, I think the right percentage of carbon dioxide is the most important thing. Since we make our own carbon dioxide, avoiding hyperventilation or being dosed with concentrated oxygen is the first thing to consider. But breathing a little hydrogen is anti-inflammatory.

## Call-in: Masks and Smoke

**Caller (Tara):** I'm wondering if you have addressed the mask issue?

**Andrew Murray:** This week there was another interview by Dr. Lee Merritt about the futility of wearing masks. Last month we discussed that the micron size of coronavirus is far smaller than an N95 mask can filter out. They are not proper bacteriological respirators and will leak air.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A simple cloth mask is even worse because the pores are gigantic in comparison to the size of the virus, which is one-eighth of a micron in diameter. Recently, the smoke exposure [from wildfires] has been causing increased sickness. The smoke particles that are most toxic are just the size of the coronavirus and smaller—all the way down to about a tenth the diameter of the coronavirus. For big particles of soot or dust, an N95 mask is very helpful. But for even average-sized bacteria, and especially the sub-micron size of the coronavirus and smoke particles, they do very little to protect you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There is a great YouTube video by Dr. Lee Merritt called "SARS-CoV-2 and the Rise of Medical Technocracy" if people want more detail on why mask-wearing is not scientific.

## Call-in: Do Masks Reduce Spread?

**Caller (Briceland):** Does wearing a mask reduce spread? Yes or no?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is no scientific evidence it does, so I would say no. In the absence of evidence, there were 17 properly controlled studies, properly interpreted, and all failed to produce any evidence.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Does wearing a mask help your health in any way by increasing the CO2 that you re-breathe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The problem with using a barrier like a mask to increase your CO2 is the resistance. If you have a breathing tube, that can be therapeutic because it doesn't increase the pressure. But with a barrier, especially an N95 mask, you have great resistance sucking air through that fine-pored filter and blowing it out. That alternating vacuum and pressure on your lungs creates inflammation in itself.

## Call-in: Vapor Masks

**Caller (Mike):** Is a vapor mask for painters with cloth over it of any value?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Particles of the sub-micron diameter are the main thing causing lung disease—both viruses and particles such as soot, silica, or metal powders. When you're around chemical fumes, a carbon filter is very helpful to take the chemicals out, but it won't take out the particles.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it will help with chemicals but not with viral particles like COVID-19.

## Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin D

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, the *New England Journal of Medicine* and *The Lancet* retracted their statement that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in the treatment of COVID. It turned out the company that conducted the research, Surgisphere, could not produce their data set for audit. What do you think about hydroxychloroquine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The actual science shows that it is anti-inflammatory and is helpful for a great variety of diseases, including viral inflammation and parasites such as malaria. They all cause damage by creating inflammation, and hydroxychloroquine is protective against those inflammations. Any competent researcher looking at that data would have known there was something phony and would have immediately found that it was a complete invention and fraud.

**Andrew Murray:** Finally, a study on COVID patients showed that those with a serum Vitamin D level higher than 30 ng/mL did significantly better than those with a level of 20 or below, which was positively correlated with increased death. Do you agree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Vitamin D is one of the most important opponents of inflammation. It directly prevents the types of inflammation caused by particles, coronavirus, influenza, and any infection.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
