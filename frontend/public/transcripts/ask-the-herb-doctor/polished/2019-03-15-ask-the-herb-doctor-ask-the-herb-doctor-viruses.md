## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** It is the third Friday of the month. I'm very pleased to introduce Dr. Raymond Peat onto the live show. We are inviting callers to ask questions related to this month's topic, which is the antiviral activity of medicinal plants and their constituents, and how Dr. Peat interprets antiviral activity. It's not always a straightforward antiviral activity, but rather a host response that is often the remedy or the provoking factor which stimulates the immune system into defense. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. As always, I'd like to start the show off by asking you to introduce yourself and give a rundown of your professional and academic background.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After undergraduate study in humanities and a master's degree also in general humanities—with a thesis on William Blake—I went to graduate school about 10 years later in biology. I was interested in brain physiology, but ended up working on reproductive physiology because the brain biology people seemed too indoctrinated with membrane theory and other stylish things at the time. So, I worked on reproductive physiology, and that got me interested in how hormones affect consciousness, among other things, and how nutrition and hormones interact with other environmental factors to affect our immunity, development, consciousness, and so on.

## Viruses and DNA

**Andrew Murray:** To open up this month's topic, we've been intimately associated with viruses ever since we walked the face of the earth. I've heard various stories of viral DNA being part of our DNA. I think up to 8% is the often-quoted proportion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Retroviral DNA seems to be around that.

**Andrew Murray:** Given how you understand viruses and any potential benefit that they may confer—although most people consider viral illness a detriment to their health—how are we to interpret the viral inclusion in our DNA and our evolution with them? How should we understand their role and our approach to dealing with the damaging effects of coexisting with viruses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** While bacteria have their own independent existence and can generally live without us, viruses depend on a higher organism to exist. When I was in graduate school, I asked a few people what they thought the origin of viruses was, and no one wanted to suggest anything at all.

At that time, around 1970, people were still very puzzled about how we could have such an immense potential immunity to every sort of conceivable antigen. They were still thinking in terms of being born or created with every gene specifying an antibody. Someone worked out the numbers and saw that it would take something the size of a tennis ball for a nucleus of every cell if it was to contain genes for every antibody that we produce. So, people had to start thinking about innovation—the inventive process happening for the immune system. The origin of viruses seems to be related to that process of cell invention, innovation, and interaction.

People have said that viral diseases became a human problem at the same time that we shifted to an agricultural economy, suggesting that diet could be part of it. Historically, wars, famines, deforestation, and all sorts of natural disasters have led to epidemics. One theory is that stress causes mutations in the virus, causing a benign virus to mutate and become dangerous. But whatever the mechanism is, it's known that viruses appear and circulate during social stresses.

When you look at an individual under stress, each type of tissue or organ sends out messages. Little micro-vesicles, microsomes, or various names for them, are emitted as very fine, sub-microscopic particles which contain nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), proteins, hormones, and a great variety of substances. These travel to other cells in the body and can be assimilated, transmitting differentiated nucleic acid patterns to other cells that are under stress, helping them adapt.

When the individual is under stress, everyone does this constantly. The sicker you are, the more of these micro-vesicles you have circulating around. That seems to be why old serum transmits aging, while young serum transfusions communicate a youthful physiology. Part of the stress of aging is that we're sending more and more of these distress messages around. Since viruses never could develop on their own, it's probable that they are an emission from a stressed population escaping from this therapeutic, corrective, adaptive process that happens constantly within our body. Some of that escapes, and getting into an organism which is in a different state of stress, that can become a virus—or a micro-vesicle—that the recipient organism hasn't learned how to deal with.

## Agriculture, Nutrition, and Immunity

**Andrew Murray:** I want to go back to something you touched on regarding the epidemiology of viruses. Viral diseases became a lot more prevalent during urbanization, when people started getting together and growing crops in one location rather than being nomadic. Populations started to increase locally in a concentration that allowed viruses an effective means of spread.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was the grains that made that kind of civilization easy to develop.

**Andrew Murray:** And the grains are bad for you, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Two things in particular: they're very high in phosphate and low in calcium. That in itself, I think, is enough to damage your immunity.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think the practice of growing wheat in large quantities to feed the masses affected the nutritional status of the people enough to allow that negative effect of decreasing calcium and increasing phosphate to become an issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and a high iron content in the diet is another thing that damages immunity because most microorganisms depend on iron as one of their host factors.

**Andrew Murray:** You've always mentioned iron as being a very damaging element in terms of its ability to oxidize things and cause damage, and that high iron is always associated with disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And that has been one of my interests in looking at the role of milk in public health, because it's very low in iron and high in calcium. Babies are immune to many diseases, such as malaria and viral diseases, while they're being breastfed. They're getting a high calcium intake and low iron intake.

**Andrew Murray:** Is it a fact that babies being breastfed have a statistically lower proportion of disease than children that have been weaned?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Some of these, like respiratory infections, are said to be only about 20% as frequent in breastfed babies. In zones where malaria is endemic, babies don't get it until right after they stop being breastfed.

## Reductive Stress and Cellular Energy

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned that viruses, or the genetic information they contain, can be passed down through the DNA and act as a messenger system. How could that possibly benefit the organism? I would imagine anybody with cold sores, measles, or warts wouldn't imagine this could be a beneficial thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the big historical epidemics, there have always been some people who never caught the disease and were simply naturally immune. I think that's the way everyone is when they aren't subjugated and fed a grain diet. I think the social invention of disease, especially viral disease, is a definite historical thing.

There hasn't been much written about the concept of reductive stress, but it simply means that when your cells are being burdened or overstimulated more than their oxidative metabolism can deal with, they lose their oxidative/pro-oxidative balance and go into reductive stress. That's where iron, for example, becomes toxic. Iron that is harmlessly stored in the oxidizing cell suddenly becomes a source of free radical destruction when the cell goes over into the overstimulated reductive state.

I think that's the central fact of the failure of the immune system: something interfering with the oxidative balance. Calcium deficiency or phosphate excess is another thing that contributes to that reductive stress. The parathyroid hormone shifts the cells in that direction. So, when you're eating too much grain phosphate, you increase your parathyroid hormone, which shifts your balance over in the direction of too much reduction, activating cellular weakness and oxidative destruction.

**Andrew Murray:** You have mentioned fairly regularly about cell stability and how the cell's inherent stability is essential for maintaining good health. Everything in this universe is about energy and order, while entropy is the disease, decay, and chaos state.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For the cell energy system, cancer, bacterial and viral infections, and various types of inflammation are all the same process. It shifts from the production of carbon dioxide, which is an anti-entropic factor. The carbon dioxide spontaneously binds to all of the amino groups in proteins and shifts the acidic balance, maintaining the mineral retaining balance of the cell—stabilizing it in the potassium-retaining, calcium- and sodium-resisting condition. When something interferes with your ability to produce that stabilizing carbon dioxide, we produce lactic acid instead. This adds exactly the opposite effect; it shifts us over into the unstable state, increased pH ionization that attracts calcium and sodium and can't take up enough magnesium and potassium.

## Gene Editing and Bacteriophages

**Andrew Murray:** I want to bring up a point about technology. The creation of human embryos that can resist HIV is a fairly controversial subject in China, where they disclosed they'd been using CRISPR technology to edit genes. Do you think this technology is going to become helpful, or is it still going to be plagued by problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's exactly the same ideology that was imposed early in the 20th century as Neo-Darwinism. It basically removed some of Darwin's most important ideas. Darwin wouldn't have subscribed to Neo-Darwinism. It's a purely mechanical theory of existence in which random variations in the genetic material are the essential idea—randomness from the bottom up.

Ever since Lamarck and Darwin, practical people working with organisms have known that doesn't work. It's only the academic ideologues who have pushed that abstract view of genetics. James A. Shapiro has worked as a bacterial geneticist and written books describing bacteria as perfect genetic engineers. His view of nature is that life is cognitive all the way down, top to bottom. Instead of randomness, it's cognition on the cellular level.

**Andrew Murray:** What about bacteriophages?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For the intestine or wounds that are infected with bacteria, Eastern Europe and Asia have, over the last 70 or 80 years, developed a great collection of these viruses that specialize in living on bacteria. They're harmless to people, but they will eliminate bacteria that have got out of control in our intestines or in infected wounds.

## HPV and Cervical Dysplasia

**Andrew Murray:** I want to ask about Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). In males, it causes genital warts, and in females, dysplasia that can eventually lead to cervical cancer. This is one example of a virus directly interfering with a host's DNA and energy to bring about cellular degradation. What do you think about HPV and the oncogenic effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cervical dysplasia can, if it persists, become *carcinoma in situ* of the cervix. But all of the women that I've known who had cervical dysplasia or *carcinoma in situ* cleared it up in just a few weeks by improving their diet and applying Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and progesterone, and taking supplements of folic acid and thyroid. 100% of them.

**Andrew Murray:** Vitamin A and progesterone—would that be best used topically? How do you see those substances acting as antiviral?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any irritation increases the reductive balance of the cell and the activation of estrogen production. Estrogen tends to lock it into that reductive and dysplastic condition. Vitamin A opposes the structural changes on epithelial cells as an anti-estrogen differentiating effect. Progesterone knocks out the estrogen and its products. All of the metabolic changes shift the cell away from estrogen and inflammation towards the oxidative, energy-producing condition.

**Andrew Murray:** Mainstream medicine uses colposcopy, where they bore a cone of tissue out of the cervix. That goes against the idea that the alarm signal of the "bystander effect" when cells are in trouble is the trigger for disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you're extremely healthy, you can stand to have a bit of tissue cut away and heal it up with a healthy, almost invisible scar. But to the extent that you're not fully in the oxidative condition, any wound is going to leave its trace as a more or less defective healed area of bad scar tissue. This has lower oxygen tension, puts the cells under stress, and tends to attract repair cells but damage them because the tissue is defective. So, it becomes a center for cancer regrowth. If you can recover your good oxidative health, then you can probably stand having a bit of tissue cut out.

## Caller: Autoimmunity and GABA

**Caller (Arizona):** Dr. Peat, your article on immunodeficiency mentions autoantibodies. Glutamate is an excitatory amino acid, and glutamate decarboxylase is the enzyme that turns glutamate into GABA, which is associated with relaxation. Some people have autoantibodies to this enzyme, associated with Type 1 diabetes and Stiff-Person Syndrome. How does the system work, and how do things like passion fruit juice influence the autoantibodies in GABA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the energy system should be able to use the antibodies to clean out the defective enzymes and not continue to be produced. Supporting the GABA system with magnesium, glucose, carbon dioxide, anti-inflammatory things, the pro-GABA steroids derived from progesterone, and the anti-immune steroid DHEA helps to redirect the antibody production. Estrogen tends to make us overproduce antibodies but not be able to guide the correction process. Things that shift the whole physiology towards oxidation and the relaxed, highly energized state of the cell are the route out of all of those autoimmune diseases.

**Caller (Arizona):** Do you have any comments on people who have adverse childhood experiences and physical injuries? I had a head injury 20 years ago.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those same things. The things that increase stability, energy production, and carbon dioxide production are constantly causing cells to be born and differentiate in the right direction.

**Caller (Arizona):** Is there any use to GABA supplementation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Normally it doesn't get into the brain because of the so-called blood-brain barrier. But when the brain is very injured, it is taken up because basically the brain needs it. But ordinarily, I think it's enough just to eat a pro-oxidative diet and avoid the excess of phosphate, lactic acid, iron, and so on.

## Caller: CO2 Bags and Thyroid Function

**Caller (New York):** I have a question about dry CO2. I've tried putting bags around my legs and arms and filling them with CO2. If I do it for four or five hours, I wake up and there is a lot of moisture in the bags. Is that a good approach? Does that make you dehydrated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mechanism is that the carbon dioxide relaxes your skin blood vessels, so your skin gets pink and warm, and then the plastic bag prevents the water from leaving. So it's just natural sweat vaporization. It's an inconvenience, but it doesn't hurt anything.

**Caller (New York):** Is it literally removing poorly structured water from the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who have had terrible edema keeping their legs or lower body in a bag very efficiently get rid of the edema. Much of the water is going to leave through your kidneys and your lungs, but also some of it is leaving through your warm skin.

**Caller (New York):** Are there downsides?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No problem, except you might get skin fungus if you stay too humid too long. It might favor the growth of microorganisms on your skin in a matter of hours.

**Caller (New York):** My second question relates to the thyroid. You discussed how the adrenal gland can rejuvenate itself. Why wouldn't the same apply to the thyroid gland? Why do older people need to take thyroid medicine forever?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason people benefit from taking a thyroid supplement isn't that their gland is weak; it's that their whole body is working to interfere with the function. There can be enough thyroxine circulating in the body of a hypothyroid person for a dozen people, but if your body is not activating it properly—not able to mobilize the mitochondrial respiration—then that thyroxine is counterproductive. In some cases, it interferes with the formation of effective T3.

**Caller (New York):** If someone didn't want to take medicine, what are the most important things to do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you have eliminated most of the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in your tissues, then your tissues are extremely sensitive to thyroid hormone. So your gland doesn't have to work very hard to keep you in a high metabolic condition.

**Caller (New York):** So the point is the consumption of PUFA interferes with the transport and absorption in the cell, not the gland production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. By the time a person is 45, the body is really soaked in polyunsaturated fats. They talk about the Omega-3 fatty acids as being predominant in the brain, but that's only an old brain. A healthy young 5-year-old brain is highly saturated in comparison to a middle-aged brain.

**Caller (New York):** Mary Enig wrote that you need some Omega-3s in a one-to-one ratio with sixes. Is the goal to get to zero?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at a newborn brain, people are now saying that all newborns are deficient in PUFA. But the reason little kids can learn so spectacularly quickly is that their brains aren't overloaded with PUFA. The metabolic rate is extremely high in the absence of PUFA. That was one of the things that Burr discovered in 1932: his animals that were made deficient in the so-called "essential fatty acids" were consuming oxygen almost twice as fast as the normal rats. People are the same. We have a terrifically high metabolic rate when we're two or three years old, and it is gradually suppressed as we accumulate fish oil and vegetable oil.

## Caller: Hydrogenated Oils

**Caller (New York):** Dr. Peat, you've recommended fully hydrogenated oils to improve metabolic rate. Do you think the catalysts they use to hydrogenate the oils, like nickel, are a serious problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's definitely worrisome, and I think we should look for a much better way to get saturated fats. But the experiments, like the Russians who used fully hydrogenated peanut oil and found that old mitochondria were restored to youthful functions just with that highly saturated peanut oil... the results are so good that despite the possible danger of traces of the catalyst, it seems beneficial.

**Caller (New York):** Do you think the more saturated the fat is, the more antiviral and antibacterial it could be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it is the saturated fatty acids that are most antibacterial and probably help with viral resistance.

## Flavonoids and Naringenin

**Andrew Murray:** I want to look at some specific components in plants. The flavonoids from green tea—epicatechin and epicatechin gallate—are said to reduce glutamate excitotoxicity. You've always talked about excitotoxicity as being a negative, wasteful state of a cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it puts you in the reductive stress condition.

**Andrew Murray:** So if these flavonoid compounds reduce this excitotoxicity, that's good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Although they're called antioxidants—like Vitamin C is called an antioxidant—when they are in the cell, they function as pro-oxidants. They shift the cell into the healthy oxidized condition.

**Andrew Murray:** What about naringenin, found in grapefruit peel and orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Marmalade is a great drug.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you see naringenin having an antiviral mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's exactly the same mechanism that aspirin has for its antiviral function: a pro-oxidative, cell-restorative function.

## Pomegranate and Zinc

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about pomegranate extract from the rind. Experiments showed that when mixed with zinc, there was a marked increase in antiviral activity against acyclovir-resistant herpes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect that zinc is a cofactor for Vitamin A. Both of them are very important for healthy protein synthesis. When I was about 50, I had aging eyebrows starting to get stiff. I found that a zinc supplement or a Vitamin A supplement—either one—would reverse the age properties of those eyebrows. I think that's because they accelerate normal differentiated protein synthesis and oppose the degraded estrogen excitation reductive process.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for your time. Next month we'll carry on with other antiviral medicinal plants.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.
