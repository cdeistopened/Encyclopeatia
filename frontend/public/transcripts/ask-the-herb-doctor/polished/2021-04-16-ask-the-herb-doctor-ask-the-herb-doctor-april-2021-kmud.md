# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Epigenetics, Stress, and Energy

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. We run these shows every third Friday of the month. We have been joined for the longest time by Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD, who has been weighing in with his academic take on a lot of different subjects that are sometimes controversial, but always informative. So once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Peat with us on the show.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who perhaps have never heard you before or would like to find out more about you, would you please give a roundup of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was studying and teaching in the humanities for about 10 years before I decided to go to graduate school in biology. That was 1968 to 1972 at the University of Oregon, where I got a PhD in reproductive physiology and aging. My intention had been to study nerve biology, following up on ideas of how language and the brain work. However, because of dogmatism in the nerve biology section, I ended up with reproductive physiology as a way to concentrate on the interactions of hormones, metabolism, and development. Over the next almost 50 years, I've been continuing to study those areas.

## Understanding the Science of Epigenetics

**Andrew Murray:** Much of what I've understood from you in the last 10 years has been related to creative energy production and stemming the dissolution of energy. Tonight's subject is epigenetics. I think I could sum it up by saying it is a heritable phenotype, the change of which does not involve alterations in the DNA sequence.

To clarify for listeners: the *genotype* gives the instruction, and the *phenotype* is the organism's appearance. I read that epigenetics may account for a significant fraction of "missing heritability," as DNA mutations only explain a minority of the expected heritable fraction.

Could you describe the basic outlines of epigenetics? Whether it is DNA changes in methylation, the histones that genes wrap around, or non-coding RNA, how do these changes bring about profound shifts in genetic information?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The established powers in biology have been very resistant to the idea that there could be any transgenerational influence of experience. That has involved reducing and emptying the idea of what happens during adaptation. Why does exercise build stronger muscles? What happens during learning?

The very idea of change was resisted powerfully by people who saw the organism as a compilation of specific traits. The idea was that our traits and parts were like a clock mechanism—the parts allowed the machine to work, but nothing very deep was changing during the adult lifetime. This has an extensive ideological background where the organism was seen as a compilation of eternal, unchangeable parts.

However, when you look at the experience of yourself or other organisms, you see that every day there is learning and change. You can't really do anything twice, because the second time you do it, you're a different person. Every moment of your experience, you are in development. The immune system is constantly operating and recording your interactions. The structure of your brain is constantly changing, and that interacts with your constantly changing immune system.

**Andrew Murray:** So it isn't just a technical mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The ideas constantly changing in your mind are actually changing the properties of brain cells, immune cells, and likely all cells. Pretty much every functional cell in the body is likely to have a fine nervous fiber. The body isn't just chemically communicating like a swarm of insects; there is a deep penetration of fine nerve fibers integrating the whole body with the conscious purpose of the organism.

Technically, people use "epigenetics" to mean certain chemical changes that persist from the state of one cell after that cell divides. But the persistence of a physiological state from moment to moment is the simplest and most basic idea of epigenetics. Every moment, we inherit the whole past of our organism.

An extreme biological analogy would be the transformation of a tadpole to a frog. That involves epigenetic changes of a very drastic sort. It is good to keep that in mind as hidden out of sight; our immune system and nervous system are having these constant little transformations. It's not as drastic as a tadpole turning into a frog, but our immune system and brain are recognizably different over very short time spans.

## Environmental Enrichment and Adaptation

**Andrew Murray:** This reminds me of the concept that you are what you believe yourself to be. Positive affirmations seem to be a roadmap to a better future because they are a way of changing your perception, mental state, and physical state via epigenetic changes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Positive or negative, the environment imposes changes on us. For example, if you put an animal in isolation—social distancing—the animal becomes more inflamed. The whole immune system is deranged in the direction of inflammation just by the depressing experience of being isolated. If you reverse that and give them social contacts and an enriched environment, that ends the inflammatory processes and starts the organism back on a constructive developmental process.

These ideas have been known to common people for hundreds of years. Lamarck, for example, said that if an organism needs longer legs or stronger arms, it will develop them by striving. Exercise improves physiology and structure. But the Darwinists didn't like the idea of the intelligence of the common organism. They invented the assumption of randomness—a metaphysical idea created out of thin air. They claimed biological changes can only be random and unpredictable.

They view adaptation as simply a summing up of many meaningless, random diffusions of molecules. The avoidance of purposefulness in life processes has been going on for about 200 years.

## Epigenetic Mechanisms of Stress and Aging

**Andrew Murray:** We have discussed how isolation and authoritarianism—deficiencies in freedom and social engagement—can be construed as very negative for us epigenetically. While our DNA might not physically change, genes can be switched off by these stresses.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things activated by authoritarianism and isolation include an excess of serotonin production. That causes a rigid tendency toward conformism. At the same time, it cools the body, slows metabolism, and makes it more passive, leaning towards learned helplessness.

Excess serotonin activates other stress-related hormones, but its worst function is to slow the metabolism and increase inflammation, tending towards degeneration. Estrogen is the other killing, stress-related chemical that lowers body temperature, predisposes the body to inflammation, makes it more receptive to authoritarianism, and creates a failure of adaptiveness.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is a compounding factor—one negative thing after another. But you mentioned this is reversible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The whole idea of epigenetics is flexibility and reversibility. It is very antagonistic to doctrines that say cancer, advanced heart disease, or kidney disease are incurable. The epigenetic idea explains how they develop from bad environmental opportunities and potentially shows routes by which they can be reversed.

Where the genetic view says you can only develop so far if your genes are bad, the epigenetic approach says genes are only a very sketchy determinant. Many other things determine our vitality. For example, prenatal exposure to too much estrogen lowers body temperature, reduces brain growth, and predisposes the organism to obesity and lifelong weakness. Conversely, exposure to extra glucose or progesterone during gestation increases brain growth, the thickness of the cortex, metabolic rate, and longevity.

## Caller: Turpentine and Iodine

**Caller:** I have two questions. First, back in 1899, medical textbooks listed about 45 illnesses allegedly cured or improved by ingesting turpentine. Today the mindset is that it is poison. Do you believe they were right back in 1899?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is still research going on showing that the turpentine family—each type of conifer has its own variant—has beneficial effects. Some stimulate wound healing and are anti-inflammatory; others are antibiotic. I don't know where the culture of fearing turpentine came from, but it coincided with the disappearance of cheap turpentine as paint thinner. It used to cost a couple of dollars a gallon; now it is very expensive and hard to get.

**Caller:** My second question relates to the thyroid. Broda Barnes and others mention taking iodine. In the current environment with halogens that block iodine, is it reasonable to take a pure, bioavailable form of iodine in a very small amount to help the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the last 20 years, several dozen studies have shown that thyroid disease corresponds to the introduction of iodized salt.

**Caller:** I agree, iodized salt is a bad product with other toxins. But if you get a pure form, say 500 to 600 micrograms—literally one drop—is that reasonable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I agree with you. I think over one milligram a day is risky, but 500 micrograms of pure iodine is not crazy. And regarding turpentine, I think that is something that needs fresh research in terms of what we know about cytokines and inflammation.

## Caller: Biochemical Mechanisms of Epigenetics

**Caller:** I heard the guest speak in general terms, but I'm wondering if we could get more specific about how epigenetics works biochemically. My understanding involves DNA methylation and histone modification. Could the guest talk about the limitations? The idea that we can "do anything" with epigenetics seems like a misuse of the science. It doesn't change the DNA; it just modifies whether DNA is turned on or off.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The attachment of methyl groups to DNA has garnered the most interest among standard genetics workers. In principle, with stress and aging, we lose the ability to activate genes. The general idea is that our DNA becomes too methylated, turning off massive amounts of genes so that we are slow to renew cell proteins.

However, certain islands of DNA become *under-methylated* due to hormone imbalances and stress. If a tumor suppressor becomes methylated, you stop repressing tumors. If you have under-methylation of an oncogene, you can activate it.

The second most popular mechanism is changes in histones. There is methylation of histones and also attachment of acetyl groups. When an acetyl group is attached, it lets the DNA become active; deacetylators are gene-suppressive.

Now, the micro-RNA regulatory systems have complicated the area. The unexpressed 97% or 98% of our DNA, which doesn't make genes, is clearly involved in regulatory processes that are not genetic in the ordinary sense but contribute to epigenetic momentum.

I think the emphasis on DNA methylation has been taken out of proportion. Estrogen and progesterone are both major regulators of gene methylation and histone acetylation. The hormones and the system's energy are largely regulated by thyroid hormone and the balance between carbon dioxide and lactate. Carbon dioxide is the quieting, efficiency-promoting, anti-inflammatory substance. Lactate is the excitatory, inflammation-promoting, de-energizing substance associated with low metabolic efficiency.

## Conclusion: Energy and Structure

**Andrew Murray:** To sum up, when the organism is fully energized—plenty of CO2, active thyroid, and metabolism working correctly—there is much less chance of epigenetic changes taking place that would destabilize the system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Energy is the thing that protects and guides the proper expansion of our structures. The energy increase under the influence of thyroid, oxidative metabolism, and carbon dioxide is a constant flow tending to complexify and build structure. If your energy fails, it goes the other way; structure deteriorates.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for giving your time again, Dr. Peat. For those listening, Dr. Raymond Peat's website is [raypeat.com](http://raypeat.com). He has a fully referenced library of newsletters and articles.

Next month, we may discuss Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, a medical doctor who had a successful practice treating pancreatic cancer but faced significant opposition. Until the third Friday of May, thank you for listening.
