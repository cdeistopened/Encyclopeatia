# Ask Your Herb Doctor

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. It is 2020, and we are looking forward to a good year. You are invited to call in with any questions related to this month's subject: vibrations, frequencies, and cell repair and regeneration through sound and vibration.

Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us again. He is a wealth of knowledge, and whilst he doesn't express himself as an expert on sound specifically, he knows enough to weigh in on some of the most interesting recent publications regarding the use of sound and electromagnetic frequency in the treatment of cancer.

I run a business called Western Botanical Medicine. I've been a naturopathic doctor for 23 years. For the last ten years, I have been working with Dr. Peat to get his insight on the defects in the understanding and dogma which has unfortunately guided medical decisions. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us in this next decade.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm planning on it.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who have never listened to the show before, would you outline your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had a master's degree in humanities and after about 10 years went back for a PhD in biology at the University of Oregon in 1972. My dissertation topic was reproductive aging.

**Andrew Murray:** So you've been intimately associated with factors around reproduction and organized cell growth. I know you don't generally advocate a lot of supplements, but progesterone is one of your favorites in terms of its use in organized cell growth and anti-inflammatory processes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Incidentally, some of my experiments had to do with the electrical behavior of tissue under the influence of progesterone, estrogen, prostaglandins, and so on.

## Sound Vibration and Cancer Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** You've always mentioned estrogen as being an excitotoxic molecule. The hormone replacement therapy industry pushed it as a pro-life hormone, claiming it helps bone thinning, but it is actually implicated in inflammation and excitotoxicity.

I was looking for material for this evening's talk regarding sound, vibration, and cell signaling. I found a 2013 article titled *Low Intensity and Frequency Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields Selectively Impair Breast Cancer Cell Viability*. They stated that this pulsed electromagnetic field therapy was a good treatment for breast cancer, didn't affect normal tissues, was non-invasive, and could be combined with existing treatments. Do you have anything to add regarding low-intensity, low-frequency vibrational output affecting cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In that experiment, they weren't paying attention to the effects of specific frequencies, so it was just giving some kind of excitation to the cells. Other people, like the Rife tradition, have been trying to identify particular frequencies that are more effective at either exciting or calming the cells.

In the 1960s, people were trying to use direct current to control cancer growth. A professor at Johns Hopkins published an article saying that he had regressed mouse mammary tumors just using a direct current polarization.

**Andrew Murray:** So just applying current, not pulsing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's known that cancer is electrically excited. It's like a wound that is stuck in an electrically excited, negatively charged condition.

**Andrew Murray:** Cancer cells are not exactly strong; they are fragile in a lot of ways. Some of the work done with vibration or electricity has validity in disrupting that cell stability because they don't have very stable membranes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And being electrically charged and excited, I think makes them more susceptible to vibrating energy fields such as in that experiment.

## The History of Cell Theory and Frequency

**Andrew Murray:** In the past, they measured frequency in cycles per second before terming it Hertz. Getting back to how a specific frequency can affect a cell—given that we are over 90% water, our membranes are fluid and respond to vibration.

There are currently protests regarding 5G technology. We are organismic and sensitive to light and vibration. The earth resonates at just under 8 Hertz. The study I mentioned used frequencies between 11 and 80 Hertz.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1960s, the doctrine was that neither sound nor electromagnetic energy below a certain frequency and energy could have any effect on the units of the cell, such as chromosomes or mitochondria. That argument started back in the late 40s when radar was accidentally killing people who stood in front of the radar antenna. The authority opinion was that electromagnetic energy could only harm you by overheating your brain or organs.

However, a researcher working with muscle cells in culture measured the activity of ATPase, which controls the disposition of energy in the cell. They found that the pitch of 440 Hz was very powerful at activating that muscle enzyme. They showed that the conventional theory of the cell was impossible for that low frequency, moderately low energy.

The dogma says that the energy concentration is too low to cause chemical changes. But the person demonstrating the effect showed that the cell structure was acting as an antenna, gathering energy from several microns of space and concentrating it so that it could act on the enzyme.

At that time, conventional opinion stated it would be impossible to make a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device because of the idea that the cell is organized randomly. It took the interaction between Gilbert Ling and his organized water explanation of cell function, and Raymond Damadian, who realized that if Gilbert Ling was right about how water behaves, you could make pictures of the water in cells electromagnetically. His invention of the MRI device really changed the possibility of explaining cell function.

**Andrew Murray:** That reminds me of the bomb testing where they tried to tell us sonic bombs were harmless. They said the same thing about low frequency, low energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's part of the reason that they deny that Gilbert Ling had an accurate description of the cell. If his picture of the cell is right, then radiation and electromagnetic energy are very relevant to cell function.

## Caller: Meditation, Breathing, and Sleep

**Caller:** Do you think meditation is safe if you're trying to lower breathing rate and increase CO2, or can it have bad effects like increasing serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think most people tend to hyperventilate too much. If you can just relax and stop hyperventilating, you retain more CO2, and that has an anti-inflammatory effect everywhere in the body.

**Caller:** Do you know what could help to reduce the need for sleep aside from increasing CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you're not getting into the deepest phase of sleep, called slow-wave sleep or deep sleep, your tissue isn't being repaired adequately. You need more hours of it. If you do things that will deepen your sleep, then you can reduce it to the normal six to eight hours. Thyroid hormone and vitamin D are two of the most important things for maintaining deep sleep.

**Caller:** Can vitamin D increase serotonin and worsen sleep, or is it just a matter of getting enough calcium to counter that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Serotonin and histamine are both brain excitatory signals. That's why antihistamines are used for improving sleep. Both anti-serotonin and antihistamine drugs improve sleep, but you can do the same thing with good nutrition: lots of calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there's any difference in the mechanism by which non-drowsy antihistamines work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Histamine is basically an inflammation signal. In insomnia, you have, in effect, an inflamed brain. You can quiet it by getting the energy production up with thyroid, sugar, and nutrients. Adrenaline is antihistamine, but it is also excitatory. Insomnia usually involves both adrenaline and histamine. The adrenaline is attempting to turn off the histamine, but if you get your energy up, you turn off both of them and let the brain relax.

**Andrew Murray:** So relaxation is not negative. Thyroid hormone allows your brain to relax through the correct utilization of sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And most aging changes occur during the hours of sleep and darkness.

## Caller: Infrasound and Wind Turbines

**Caller:** I have a question about infrasound. We were just embattled with a factory proposing wind power turbines. The proponent denied that there was any effect from infrasound—sound produced below the audible range. Do you have any thoughts on the biological effects of infrasound?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think cell culture gives an insight into what might be happening. The infrasound frequencies are around 10 to 50 per second. When growing cells in culture, they lose some of the properties they had in the organism. One of the tricks to make cell culture more lifelike is to give it some kind of pulsation, because cell physiology depends on the fact that the blood is rhythmically pulsing through the system. The pulse rate is in the infrasonic frequency.

**Caller:** I take from that you would expect there to be physiological effects from a constant infrasound?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I don't know that anyone has clearly demonstrated it, but you can use equivalent pulsations to show that you are changing the cell physiology *in vitro*.

## Bone Regeneration and Ultrasound

**Andrew Murray:** I found a 2019 article on bone regeneration titled *Translational Insights into Extremely Low Frequency Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields for Bone Regeneration*. It showed that sound improved osteoblastic activity—bone mineralization and formation.

Another 2019 document discussed ultrasound. What frequencies does ultrasound work at?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For treating things, they use anything from 50,000 to 100,000 Hz, but the imaging is around a million cycles per second.

Around 1970, someone discovered that putting ultrasound on infected tonsils caused them to recover and become uninflamed. Gradually, they found that bone healing and soft tissue wound healing were accelerated. Part of that is thought to be the activation of cell regenerating signals such as nitric oxide and estrogen that accelerate stem cell growth and multiplication in the early stages of healing.

The imaging of bone density or osteoporosis can be done with ultrasound. You can tell the strength of a bone as well as its density. Since ultrasound stimulates bone repair, it would be reasonable if doctors would evaluate aging women's bones using ultrasound. Instead, they X-ray them, and X-rays actually weaken the bone and accelerate osteoporosis.

A friend of mine who had liver enzyme elevation and signs of hepatitis or developing cirrhosis had a very prolonged ultrasound examination of her liver. A couple of weeks later, she went back for another exam and her liver had completely recovered. I suspect it was from that half an hour of looking around with an ultrasound imaging device.

**Andrew Murray:** The mechanism would be an anti-inflammatory effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the only place it shouldn't be used is around the head because it tends to emulsify tissue if it's too energetic. You don't want emulsified brain tissue.

## Caller: Hepatitis C Treatment

**Caller:** I have an appointment next week to start interferon for my hepatitis C, but I had a very thorough ultrasound on my liver to find that out. Should I ask them if I don't need the treatment?

**Andrew Murray:** I didn't think they used interferon anymore because it was so brutal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the test to identify Hepatitis C has done more harm than the virus itself because of the desperate attitude they take with treatments like interferon. I think people who probably wouldn't have had any problem if it hadn't been diagnosed have been injured by some of the treatments they get.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I recall you saying that Ribavirin might not have been a bad compound to try compared to interferon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's less harmful.

**Andrew Murray:** Caller, if your blood work doesn't look bad and you feel fine, it's a personal call. I know people who failed interferon treatment and wound up with cirrhosis, and others who have had Hep C for 50 years and are fine.

**Caller:** I feel really good. One more question: What about hydrogen peroxide treatment? You start with one drop a day and go up to 30.

**Andrew Murray:** That sounds like MMS (Miracle Mineral Supplement), which is actually bleach.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a study in Italy that identified it as a probable carcinogen.

**Andrew Murray:** I would not go down that route.

## Caller: Osteoporosis

**Caller:** I was diagnosed with osteoporosis 10 years ago. I have an osteopenic spine and an osteoporotic hip, however, I feel fine. I just walked 4 miles to get a tooth extracted. I also have hypothyroidism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin K is very important, along with vitamin D and calcium intake. Vitamin K prevents the removal of calcium from the bone and keeps it out of the soft tissues. The combination is much more effective than either one alone.

## Mechanisms of Sound Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** One abstract I looked at showed that exposure to a cytokine production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)—which is responsible for inflammation—was modulated by sound waves. The sound blocked pro-inflammatory pathways like protein kinase C.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think normal activity has some of those anti-inflammatory effects. If you're forced into inactivity, you develop generalized inflammation. Normal activity of muscles lowers stress hormones and increases constructive hormones such as progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone. Normal activity in itself is an anti-inflammatory process. I suspect that these certain frequencies are imitating the normal rhythm of proper activity.

## Caller: Fibromyalgia and EMF

**Caller:** I have fibromyalgia. I find that when I get into a big city and I'm around a lot of power lines, I start feeling unwell. Is there a relationship?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a lot of doctors are coming around to recognize the importance of hormone balance. Good thyroid function, vitamin D, and keeping up the constructive hormones like progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA.

**Andrew Murray:** Since you are female and post-menopausal, you are exposed to estrogen in an unopposed way. It is important to get adequate progesterone because it is the antagonist of inflammatory estrogen. In fibromyalgia, estrogen dominance certainly has a role to play in tired, waterlogged muscles.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cortisol is a bone destroyer and progesterone is the main antagonist of cortisol.

## Caller: Hulda Clark's Device

**Caller:** It was Hulda Clark who wrote *The Cure for All Cancers*. I wonder if the doctor approves of the device she created to tone out certain bacterial frequencies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think she used just a simple low-voltage direct current stimulator. That device can be used productively, but I don't think she understood enough to use it productively.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time. Dr. Peat's website is [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). He has a huge list of fully referenced scientific articles.
