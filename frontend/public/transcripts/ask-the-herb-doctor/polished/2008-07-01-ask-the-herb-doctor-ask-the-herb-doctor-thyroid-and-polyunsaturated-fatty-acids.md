## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture certified organic herbal extracts. This month we are very pleased to welcome Dr. Ray Peat onto the show. I know our listeners are keen to hear what 40 years of experience has revealed concerning your areas of expertise, Dr. Peat: progesterone, related hormones, and how physiological differences can be made by relatively simple dietary changes—and in some cases, thyroid hormone supplementation. Thank you for being our guest.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hello.

**Andrew Murray:** For those listeners who are perhaps not familiar with you, could you outline your academic and professional career?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, I was studying the humanities—literature and linguistics—and I worked on master's degrees in several departments. It was about 12 years in which I taught humanities and worked at several universities before I went back to graduate school to work in biology. I had been interested in biology all through the 1950s and 60s, but I considered the dogmatism to be more than I wanted to deal with. After going through five or six other graduate departments, I learned that you can get through just about any department if you keep your mouth shut and don't ask questions or challenge people.

## The Physiological Importance of Thyroid

**Andrew Murray:** We've mentioned the importance of thyroid on previous shows. Would you explain the physiological importance of a correctly functioning thyroid, and what symptoms would be experienced by a person with a low thyroid state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the higher animals require thyroid to survive and to differentiate. Without any thyroid function, we would basically be like a fungus. The brain is the organ that is most responsive to the thyroid hormone; it uses the most oxygen and burns fuel at the highest rate. All of the oxidative processes required for high-sensitive functioning depend on the thyroid hormone. The difference between us and a bacterium or a fungus is largely the thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's really a master controller.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's the master gland. It is even more basic than the pituitary, which they often call the master hormone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the thyroid hormone will affect the pituitary function, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pituitary depends on the metabolism of the brain and gets signals from the whole body, but the thyroid is what regulates the brain and governs the signals that the other cells send out.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if a person's brain isn't utilizing oxygen efficiently, that is probably because of their thyroid gland, and then their pituitary won't operate correctly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The thyroid keeps the energy of all cells up and makes them ready to work. A lot of people have thought of the thyroid as an exciting hormone. They have heard that it will make them burn calories faster and lose weight, so they think of it as similar to speed or adrenaline. Actually, it works in the opposite direction. People who are low in thyroid usually have defective sleep, often insomnia. Taking the right amount of thyroid can bring on deep sleep in an insomniac, sometimes in just a few minutes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that because it helps balance the adrenaline levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over a period of days, it will lower a person's adrenaline, sometimes 40-fold, down to a normal or low level. At the same time, it raises the cell's stores of energy and lets the cell get into its relaxed condition. When you have a cramp in a muscle, often that's because the energy is depleted. Low thyroid people tend to get muscle cramps very easily.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I have several clients who have calf cramps, and they think it's down to them being hypothyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the old, very meaningful tests for hypothyroidism is to have a person kneel on a chair and thump the Achilles tendon. Rather than looking for the extent of the reflex, you look for the speed of the relaxation. To relax, the muscle has to restore its energy and get ready for another twitch. The brain and all other organs are the same way. When the energy is down, it can't relax.

## Adrenaline, Cortisone, and Stress

**Andrew Murray:** Could you explain the adrenal fatigue syndrome? If we're talking about people who are over-stimulated by a low thyroid, compensating with adrenaline, how do the adrenal glands become tired out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the ways you can measure a low thyroid is to measure either the urine adrenaline breakdown products or the blood adrenaline. It will often be 20, 30, or 40 times higher than normal in a hypothyroid person. Adrenaline is the emergency compensation for low energy. When the adrenaline is high, it tries to bring the energy back to normal. First, it draws glucose out of the liver. If you are low thyroid, you tend to deplete your glucose stores. When those are gone, your adrenaline goes even higher and starts pulling fats out of storage. The fats poison your ability to burn glucose and create a diabetes-like condition.

When the fatty acids aren't providing adequate energy, then you resort to producing cortisone. The cortisone usually follows just a few minutes after the surge of adrenaline. The cortisone starts breaking down your tissues—muscles are the first to go. The thymus is dissolved, sometimes in just a few hours, with high cortisone. The breaking down of your tissues provides sugar to help you restore energy. The cortisone should be a very quick, instantaneous reaction; otherwise, it starts destroying all of your essential organs.

**Andrew Murray:** This would be the classic wasting of a hyperactive or sympathetically stimulated person.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen several very hypothyroid men who, no matter how much they ate, couldn't put on weight. They weighed 130 or 135 pounds and were very frail looking. When they took thyroid, they didn't have to eat so much, but they could suddenly put on muscle because their cortisone went down.

At the same time that your adrenaline is driving your adrenal glands to produce more cortisone, your adrenals need the thyroid hormone to convert cholesterol into cortisone. The destruction of your muscles to turn them into food liberates tryptophan and cysteine amino acids, which are signals to turn your thyroid down so that you don't totally destroy yourself in the first two days.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's a vicious cycle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The stress turns your thyroid down. When your thyroid is low, you can't convert cholesterol into cortisone, and that's what is called adrenal failure. But it's really thyroid failure.

## Blood Pressure and Cholesterol

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this why people with low thyroid sometimes end up with high blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can find dozens of articles in PubMed showing that high blood pressure goes with hypothyroidism. Very quickly, you can usually lower the blood pressure by correcting the thyroid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This is contrary to popular opinion. People think thyroid is a stimulant that will raise blood pressure and give you heart palpitations. But in reality, if people don't have enough thyroid, their body will start overcompensating with adrenaline, which gives those stimulatory effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The adrenaline and lack of energy increase the tendency of the blood to clot and for the red cells to become rigid so that they don't go through the capillaries very easily. The blood is thicker and harder to pump, which tends to cause high blood pressure and heart problems.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And even increase the possibility of a stroke?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Meanwhile, since you aren't able to produce the anti-stress hormones when your thyroid is low, the cholesterol simply rises in an attempt to compensate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's why people with low thyroid have high cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's a mirror image of your metabolic rate. That has been known since the 1930s: if you take out a person's thyroid, the cholesterol zooms up. If you give them a supplement, the cholesterol comes down in just a matter of a few days. Longevity, intelligence, and resistance to cancer are assisted by high cholesterol. Lowering cholesterol without correcting your thyroid is exactly the wrong thing to do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's what the statin drugs aim to do.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you force your cholesterol down, you're unable to make progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, and the whole range of protective steroids.

**Andrew Murray:** There was a recent Harvard study that proved cholesterol less than 200 was likely to cause more cardiovascular accidents than cholesterol of 230. What's your opinion on the reference range being less than 200?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Framingham study showed that people over 50 are much more likely to have dementia if they have less than 200 cholesterol. There are several indicators that 260 or 270 is the best for longevity and resistance to cancer.

## Diet and Metabolism

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What is your view on why so many Americans seem to be low thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It started back in the 30s or earlier. The food industry was starting to convince people to use vegetable oil, synthetic butter, and synthetic cooking oils made out of cottonseed oil. In the 1930s, George Crile and his wife did surveys around the world of people's oxygen consumption and thyroid function. He showed that in almost every other country—except where they have a high incidence of tuberculosis, cancer, and heart disease—people averaged about 25% higher metabolic rates than Americans.

It was pretty well established that 40% of Americans benefited from taking a thyroid supplement. It's probably the grain-centered diet. In the Yucatan and in Alaska among the Eskimos, the people had higher metabolic rates. Those are cultures that are not bread-centered.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the Eskimos who ate lots of saturated fats had a better utilization of oxygen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. But the Americans with their bread and other starchy foods tended to eat only the muscle meat. In the more primitive, less affluent cultures, they economize and eat the whole animal: the brain, the thyroid glands, the blood, feet, and skin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they have a more balanced ratio of proteins, not just the muscle meat like we eat in America?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Muscle meat is very powerful at suppressing the thyroid because that's its function. When we resort to cortisone, we destroy our muscles. The muscle dissolution coming into the bloodstream suppresses the thyroid. So when you eat a simple steak or hamburger, your body can't tell the difference between stress or eating simple meat. It suppresses your thyroid because of the imbalance of amino acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What can people do to eat a protein that isn't going to suppress their thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you stew a chicken and skim off the fat after it has cooked the meat loose from the bones, you will get gelatin out of the skin, bones, and connective tissues, which will be about half of the protein of the whole chicken. That would be what the primitive cultures were eating every day—a perfectly balanced set of amino acids. You can approximate that by eating shellfish, shrimps, and oysters, where you eat the whole body of the animal. Milk and cheese are also pretty good for the protein balance.

## Thyroid Testing Methodology

**Andrew Murray:** Would you explain the methodology of testing thyroid function and why so many people fall through the cracks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, a new type of thyroid hormone was synthesized containing only T4. Around that same time, a blood test came on the market which measured iodine bound to protein (Protein Bound Iodine or PBI). They assumed it was the same as the synthetic hormone they were promoting. The synthetic hormone was tested only on young men, who are the least likely to have a hormone problem.

When they measured the iodine carried on a blood protein, they found that only 5% of the population had low protein-bound iodine. They convinced doctors that 95% of the population didn't need thyroid, even though the clinical symptoms established up to 1940 showed that everyone with those symptoms—dry skin, falling hair, constipation, insomnia, lethargy—benefited from taking thyroid.

In the 1960s, it turned out that this protein-bound iodine had almost nothing to do with thyroid function. It was found that the real thyroid hormone was T3, not thyroxine (T4). It's present in a very small amount in the blood. They were able to measure T3 by the late 1960s, but they standardized the new test against the old idea, which had been established with a completely meaningless measurement. So now, it doesn't matter how accurate your test is; if you keep the idea that statistically only 5% are hypothyroid, you're not going to be treating the people who need it.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs) vs. Saturated Fats

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about the controversy of polyunsaturated fats—the fats that are supposedly good for your heart—versus the saturated fat of our ancestors, like lard and beef fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This really started with the paint and plastics industry learning how to make paint, varnish, and plastics out of petroleum. Previously, fish oil and seed oil—linseed oil in particular—had been the basis of paints. The petroleum chemists learned how to make paint very cheaply, so the farmers and the industry producing paint stock had no market.

First, they used some old research which had already been disproved. In the 1940s, the George and Mildred Burr Company claimed that unsaturated fats were essential nutrients. However, people working on B vitamins showed that what the Burrs had created was a B vitamin deficiency by not feeding their animals a balanced diet. Burr himself demonstrated that animals without the unsaturated fats had an extremely high metabolic rate, about 50% higher than average.

The lab in Texas showed that it was specifically Vitamin B6 and Zinc which were deficient in the diet, not actually the polyunsaturated oils. The polyunsaturated oils were simply suppressing metabolism so that rats didn't need so much food. The pig farmers knew about that and applied it by giving polyunsaturated fats to their pigs to fatten them by suppressing their metabolism.

**Andrew Murray:** So polyunsaturated fats actually increase your weight while lowering the number of calories you can burn?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Is it right to assume that polyunsaturated fatty acids have a slowing effect on thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Experiments in France showed that they block the secretion of the hormone from the thyroid gland itself, block the transport on proteins in the blood, and block all of the cells' functions in response to the thyroid hormone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you list the oils in our food chain today that are very high in polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Safflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, flax, and soy. Canola isn't quite so bad, but it's still toxic. Sunflower is pretty bad.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And what about fish oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's worse. But the good thing about fish oil is that it's so unstable that most of it doesn't survive to reach your bloodstream, or it would inhibit your thyroid function. It breaks down into other compounds which are actually toxic. The first thing you see affected is the immune system. The breakdown products of the spontaneously oxidizing fish oil include acrolein, which is a carcinogen, and ethane. Several of these toxic breakdown products are immunosuppressive. They have an anti-inflammatory effect that in the short run makes them seem beneficial.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why people who take fish oils say they notice a benefit, like easier joint movement or resolved skin conditions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. 50 years ago, they used to treat arthritis and psoriasis with X-rays. You could stop just about any inflammation for a while with X-rays. The polyunsaturated fats work by exactly the same mechanism that the X-rays do: creating an immune deficiency and an inability to produce inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** How about the news that these polyunsaturated fats are so unstable that the adipose tissue stores the fat, and this product can remain in a body for several years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you totally change your diet from saturated to unsaturated, it takes about four years for the complete change to be reflected in your stores. So you can figure that the average fat molecule is four years old. If you've ever left your cooking oil bottle out of the fridge, you've noticed it gets sticky. That hardening, oxidizing process would be much faster at body temperature.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this what plaque in the artery is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For 30 or 40 years, people have been demonstrating that the chemicals in the lining of the artery are identical to age pigment. Age pigment is produced in proportion to the unsaturated fats in your diet versus the saturated fats, and the amount of oxidants such as heavy metals. Every time you draw fats out of your storage, they have to circulate through the bloodstream, exposing the lining of the arteries to free radicals. Recent experiments have shown that polyunsaturated fats poison a mechanism that normally causes cholesterol to be taken out of the arteries.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's time to throw out the corn and safflower oil and start eating butter and coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's it.

**Andrew Murray:** We keep getting told that fish oils are the "good" fats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even though it's established that seed oils are carcinogenic and cause heart disease, they've shifted to say the real essential fatty acids are the fish oil type, the Omega-3. That basically comes from a study of Greenland people where they claimed there was very little heart disease. But a more recent study of Alaska Eskimos showed that the ones who eat a lot of fish have no less heart disease than the ones who don't. A study in Canada found that if you look at the amount of Omega-3 fats in their tissues, the pollution—such as PCBs and mercury—exactly corresponds to the amount of fish oil.

## Caller Questions

**Caller:** On a different show, you talked about how cholesterol itself was not the problem, but something else was the culprit. You said if you took at least 500 milligrams of B12, B2, and something else...

**Andrew Murray:** How do you equate the B vitamins to cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver is constantly detoxifying all the chemicals you absorb. Anything in your bloodstream is processed through the liver. If you're deficient in thyroid, the liver can't handle the cholesterol or free fatty acids. The liver treats the polyunsaturated fats as toxins and destroys them. The cholesterol is recycled. But the liver can't process these things without adequate protein and B vitamins. Thiamine (B1) is essential for making the liver work efficiently. Low thyroid function makes it impossible to use these B vitamins and protein.

I usually advocate eating a diet naturally rich in vitamins. Eggs and liver are probably the richest sources of all the essential nutrients for liver function. But if you eat too much liver, it can act like too much muscle meat and suppress your thyroid. Too much carotene or Vitamin A can also suppress your thyroid. So I recommend lots of liver and eggs, but only if you're balancing with the right amount of thyroid function.

**Caller:** How much Vitamin B12, B6, and B2 do you think a person needs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It varies according to your metabolic rate.

**Caller:** Is it better to eat butter than olive oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, butter and coconut oil. Olive oil is not as good as butter.

**Caller:** Why do you say butter is good for you when so many people say it's bad?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Researchers, specifically Nanji's group, are showing that they can cure liver disease caused by polyunsaturated fats by adding butter and other saturated fats to the diet. It is the polyunsaturated fats that cause alcoholics to get cirrhosis and hepatitis, not just the alcohol.

**Caller:** What about the glop in your arteries?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is caused by the vegetable oils, primarily.

**Caller:** Are you saying that Omega-3s are not good for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they're not. Alzheimer's disease is now definitely associated with inflammatory processes and free radical oxidative processes which are supported by the polyunsaturated fats.

**Caller:** It does seem to make the arthritis in my knee better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's anti-inflammatory, but those are the oxidized breakdown products that suppress your immune system. At the same time they suppress inflammation, they also suppress your ability to stop infections or the spread of a tumor.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How many times a week would you suggest eating eggs or liver or shellfish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can eat as many eggs as you want if they're well-fed chickens. But they feed most chickens now the same thing they feed pigs—a lot of corn and soy. So currently for Americans, I advocate only one or two eggs a day because of the polyunsaturated fats.

**Caller (Rosa):** I was curious to hear what Ray Peat thinks about the Ayurvedic oil change. I found it very interesting that he says it takes four years to change out the fatty acid composition of your cells. Would doing an oil change where you're actually drinking a lot of oil speed up the changeover?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you have been eating polyunsaturated fats and you stop, and start eating only butter and coconut oil, does eating an excessive amount of oil speed up the change?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You only see a big problem in someone who's very fat. They'll take thyroid or use coconut oil, which can boost your thyroid while it's in your bloodstream. But as soon as your blood sugar falls and you draw fats out of storage, then your thyroid is suppressed again.

One lawyer who weighed over 300 pounds thought he would lose weight in a hurry, so he drank a cup of coconut oil. He said he really believed he might explode or start on fire because he was so hot for about an hour. So you don't want to take more than about a tablespoon at once because you can notice your heart rate goes up, you breathe harder, and get pinker for about 30 minutes to an hour.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there any way to actually increase that change or do you just have to wait four years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just taking a little bit of coconut oil at a time. It depends on your body weight. I added just a tablespoon per day and lost a pound a week and stabilized 12 pounds lower.

**Caller:** I have Hashimoto's disease. I've been on 175 micrograms of thyroid since 1976, although it goes up and down. I would dearly love to find somebody who knows what is going on because MDs are not doing me any good.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat has offered to consult with clients through either Andrew or myself. We can consult with Dr. Peat on your behalf.

**Caller:** He says butter, coconut oil... what did he say about olive oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In moderation. It's got 10% of the polyunsaturated fats on average. So a teaspoon or two per day isn't enough to hurt.

**Caller:** I had high cholesterol, 330, and I thought I'd better bring it down.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cholesterol is very good for a person. If you take an adrenal gland or an ovary and run blood into it, the amount of progesterone coming out the other side is directly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the blood. That depends on Vitamin A and thyroid to be converted. So when a person takes thyroid and sees their cholesterol quickly coming down, that's because they're making the defensive hormones like pregnenolone and progesterone.

## Liver Health and Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Would you have any advice for hepatitis patients and how thyroid hormone would be useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having a doctor who understands thyroid is convenient. Mary Shomon's website has a list of doctors all over the country. I've seen people with terminal cirrhosis who, after six months of using saturated fat, thyroid, and in some cases progesterone, saw no evidence of cirrhosis left, even though their liver had been very enlarged and rubbery. It was normal after six or eight months.

**Andrew Murray:** Fantastic. It's been a real pleasure to have you on the show, Dr. Peat. Thank you very much for joining us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat's website is www.raypeat.com. Thank you, Dr. Peat, for giving a lot of clients hope that with proper nutrition and a good diet, they can become much healthier.

**Andrew Murray:** Like I said at the beginning of the show, the reason we invited you on is because we've actually seen the difference ourselves. Thank you very much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
