## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** A very good evening to you all. This is *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. This month’s subject is going to be about breast cancer. In the last couple of months, I've been approached by a startling number of people that have either known someone who's going through breast cancer treatment or I've met people that have been dying of breast cancer. It has prompted me to bring this subject up again.

This month's show will be about breast cancer awareness and prevention. I don't think we want to necessarily dwell on the treatment, although we will mention alternative medical treatments that are available and showing pretty good promise for inhibiting estrogen, such as aromatase inhibitors. But the prevention of it is the fundamental key to good health. If we put people's diets and lifestyles in the right place to begin with, that preventive strategy is probably a better payoff.

We're very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat to the show this evening. My name is Andrew Murray. I graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine. I am joined by my wife, Sarah.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Good evening. My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray and I'm delighted to be on the show talking about ways to help prevent breast cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. As always, I want to make sure people get an introduction from you about your academic and professional background before we get into tonight's subject.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm a biologist, a PhD from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology and especially related to aging and reproductive hormone issues.

## The Causes of Breast Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Most people will recognize breast cancer awareness and the numbers of people that die from breast cancer as being fairly staggering. I saw an article stating it was the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. What's your opinion of the causes of breast cancer, and how does this differ from the medical interpretation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The animal studies have been pretty clear for almost 100 years that it is a matter of an estrogen-like irritation. Even if it isn't exactly estrogen in the narrowest sense, the main carcinogenic substances, such as in smoke and tar, are estrogen-like in their structure and effect. The breast is very sensitive to an imbalance of estrogen-like stimulation. It's susceptible to anything that has an estrogen-like effect, including smoke and pollutants of various sorts.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this down to the fact that the estrogen receptors are most concentrated in the breast tissue or some other reason?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every cell has estrogen receptors, but the way they interact with other functions is more important than the number of receptors. Once you're exposed to estrogen, a cell will produce more and more receptors. Progesterone has a very central function of destroying estrogen receptors. So, a breast that's well balanced and exposed to enough progesterone won't have very many estrogen receptors during the progesterone dominance.

**Andrew Murray:** So the actual exposure to estrogen will cause an upregulation in the expression of estrogen receptors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, pretty much in any cell. Irritation in general will do that. A failure of energy combined with stimulation will make estrogen receptors start to appear. In old people, as the energy production decreases, any irritation tends to induce estrogen production as well as sensitivity by the receptors.

**Andrew Murray:** You are linking estrogen to irritation and stress. You are saying that estrogen can be directly responsible for cancers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The animal studies in the 30s and 40s were very clear that it isn't just the normally responsive tissues like the uterus and the breast that will cancerize under the influence of estrogen and similar things—those are just the most sensitive. With increased, uninterrupted exposure to estrogen, the sequence tends to go: first cancer of the uterus, then cancer of the breast, then of the lungs, kidneys, intestine, liver, and brain.

**Andrew Murray:** Are you talking about primaries now or metastases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Primary. Any tissue that is de-energized and irritated will develop not only the ability to respond to estrogen, but the actual ability to make estrogen. Your fat, skin, or liver can become a source of estrogen in proportion to how much stress you're under, even if you don't have ovaries.

## Fat, PUFA, and Estrogen Production

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's not just our monthly cycling that's exposing women to estrogen. Estrogen is prominent in foods and in our environment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fat is particularly sensitive. It isn't very well supplied with defensive and energetic systems, so it seems to be a major age-related source of estrogen, especially if you're overweight.

**Andrew Murray:** Are we talking polyunsaturated fats or fats in general?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was just your normal, ordinary fat cells. But since the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) increase the deposition and storage of fat, and since they break down to form the inflammation-promoting prostaglandins, they make the fat cells more likely to produce excess estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** You have mentioned increasing the dominance of saturated to unsaturated fat by avoiding polyunsaturates. Ultimately, over three or four years, the body fat composition could be turned back to a more saturated type fat if you avoid the polys.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is a thing called the saturation index, which is just the ratio between a saturated fat like stearic acid and a polyunsaturated such as linoleic acid. People with cancer have a higher polyunsaturation and lower saturation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But you're saying a saturated fat cell is still capable of producing estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cell which is more saturated is stabler and less likely to produce estrogen. The more highly polyunsaturated fats are very closely connected with estrogen. The amount in the tissue and in circulation of, say, a 5 or 6 unsaturated fat—such as you find in fish oil—is closely associated with the level of estrogen stimulation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So eating nuts and seeds that are high in those polyunsaturated fats, and fried foods that are fried in corn and canola oil, is going to be more promoting than an estrogenic fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For 80 or 90 years, about every 10 or 15 years, someone has done a study showing that the more polyunsaturated fat in the diet, the higher the cancer incidence. It goes all the way down to extremely rare cancer incidents when there's no polyunsaturated fat in the diet.

**Andrew Murray:** Cancer is obviously one of those effects of decreasing energy. Because of the thyroid-suppressing effects [of PUFA], there is a direct relationship between low energy and the ability for systems to lose their correct structure and organization.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the diet factors that shows up repeatedly in association with a low rate of cancer is a high fruit intake. Fruit eaters, getting the carbohydrate and the sugar, produce saturated fats of their own. So they keep a relatively high saturation index in their tissues.

## The History of HRT and Estrogen Marketing

**Andrew Murray:** It's always mystified me how HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) has carried on for such a long time. Now they're finally admitting that saturated fats are actually better for you than polys, but HRT is still a concept. How did it come to a position where estrogen was promoted as beneficial for bones and age-related dementia, when you have evidence to show it's actually the opposite?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a very good essay on the internet, a Harvard Law School paper by Carla Rothenberg on the history of hormone replacement therapy. It gives the political and economic history of how the 12 big estrogen companies in 1942 got together to basically take over the FDA, medical journals, and universities to indoctrinate the idea that estrogen was the female hormone that would promote fertility and all the good female virtues. This went absolutely against the research of the 1930s, which showed that progesterone was the essential female hormone that promoted fertility and good pregnancy success.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They knew back in the 1800s that the chimney sweeps would die of testicular cancer from the estrogenic effects of the soot.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but this was all turned around by these 12 giant companies getting together to promote the idea of estrogen as the beneficial female hormone. A Harvard husband and wife pair of doctors promoted the idea that you should give pregnant women estrogen to prevent miscarriage. That produced two generations of DES babies; their daughters also were susceptible to cancer.

After the news got out by the late 50s that estrogen was not good for preventing miscarriage, they came out with the contraception idea. They knew in the 30s that estrogen causes miscarriages and abortion, so they sold it for the opposite as long as they could get away with it, then came on the market to sell it to prevent or interrupt pregnancies.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So a lot of contraceptive pills allow fertilization to occur, but inhibit implantation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, did some very clear research on that. He showed that a small amount at the time of, or just before, implantation would prevent implantation. But a slightly larger amount after implantation had occurred would cause it to be ejected. He made a graph showing that at each stage of pregnancy, just slightly increasing the dose of estrogen would cause miscarriage, all the way from preventing implantation to aborting it.

**Andrew Murray:** That's incredible. It’s like another worldwide brainwashing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several years ago, someone did a survey of the publications in the *Journal of the American Medical Association*. In the first years after the industry got this conspiracy together, they found that 200 different health conditions had been published in that one journal as treatable or curable by estrogen. All of those 200 turned out to be false. The quantity and quality of the fraud is just staggering.

**Andrew Murray:** I thought the only beneficial thing estrogen was used for was getting pregnant, but you're saying that estrogen at the time of preconception or post-conception would actually abort the fetus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Soderwall was probably the most concise in showing that it was exactly a dose relationship. You could shift that dose relationship by increasing either the amount of progesterone or progesterone and Vitamin E as antagonists to that. My dissertation showed that interaction worked through the availability of oxygen. Estrogen cuts off the availability of oxygen to the embryo, making the uterus short circuit and burn up the oxygen before the embryo gets it. Progesterone and Vitamin E both improve the delivery or preservation of oxygen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did they not promote progesterone for all these 200 different diseases because it's so expensive to manufacture and estrogen is cheap?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** More than that. They knew in the 30s—someone simply put a glass plate in the smoke of a candle and then extracted the soot—that they had a whole variety of chemical substances, soot essences, which were estrogenic as well as carcinogenic. They understood that there was an infinite opportunity for having a patentable, specific estrogen that you could market as your own product. But anytime you change the molecule of progesterone, you decrease or destroy its effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So all those synthetic progestins actually have an estrogenic effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because part of progesterone's effect is what it turns into. The additives attached to the progesterone molecule specifically block its conversion into that natural range of other steroids. Since the brain is a major source and user of progesterone, probably the worst effect of the synthetic progestins is that they interfere with brain function.

Marian Diamond, a professor at University of California, did studies on animals showing that estrogen in pregnancy stops the growth of the brain, especially the cortex—making it thinner and smaller. Progesterone increases the growth, especially of the cortex, making it bigger, more intelligent, and less psychopathic. Katharina Dalton, working in England with her human patients, found accidentally the same thing. Women who were having pregnancy difficulties, before treatment, their older kids averaged below 100 IQ. Once she treated them and prevented their toxemia of pregnancy [with progesterone], the kids averaged over 130 IQ.

**Andrew Murray:** Before we move on, I want to mention Tamoxifen. It was a drug used to treat breast cancer but actually promoted endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was given for liver tumors and eye damage. It's less powerful than estradiol, so it can protect against the overproduction of estradiol, but in itself, it is estrogenic.

## Caller: Urea Dosage and Water Retention

**Caller (Kansas City):** In last month's interview, Dr. Peat mentioned up to 120 grams per day of urea, 15 grams at a time, for getting rid of excess water. When you said excess water, what were you referring to exactly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's interesting in relation to estrogen because within about five minutes of an exposure to estrogen, cells begin to take up a lot of water. That excess water stimulates cell division and growth. That's part of the process of promoting cancer growth: to keep them in an excited, inflammatory state of too much water, which keeps them from differentiating and functioning but makes them able to keep dividing. One of the principles of cancer treatment should be looking at the body's water economy.

**Caller (Kansas City):** How long or how often for the 120 grams of urea per day to actually have that benefit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A Greek doctor, Danopoulos, was using urea in various forms—injecting it right into tumors, giving it intravenously, and applying it in crystal form to open superficial tumors. It doesn't destroy tissue even in a pure crystalline concentrated form. Urea isn't an osmolite; it has a very strange interaction with water. It can go into cells freely. So what it's doing to remove excess water from cells isn't osmotically drawing out the water; it's adjusting the structure of the cell so that it doesn't have that excited need to retain water.

The typical intravenous dose would use a 30% solution, giving maybe 20 grams at a time, but up to a total of 120 grams per day. This could be for heart failure, inflammation of the brain, or treating cancer. 20 or 30 grams at a time can also be given orally and it's well absorbed.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you're saying you could do 20 to 30 grams a day, which is probably about a couple of teaspoons?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That much at a time, up to 120 grams total per day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And then you'd want to dissolve it in a little salt water or fruit juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people recommending it for treating heart failure had patients staying on it for years. They were very stable using urea and recommended using about 20 grams at a time in a glass of fruit juice, several times a day.

## Genetics vs. Stress

**Andrew Murray:** What is your opinion of the cause of breast cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The standard opinion is that it's a genetic thing, either inherited or occurring randomly. The evidence is just overwhelming against that. The genetic problems almost always develop *after* the cancer is in progress. The overstimulation and undersupply of energy to the cell keeps the DNA from being repaired. So the stress causes the mutation rather than the mutation causing the cancer.

The inherited genes, such as BRCA 1 and 2, are simply an indication that the person is more sensitive to stress and estrogen toxic effects. So the anti-estrogen programs are more important and more effective for protecting them.

## Stress, Endorphins, and Nitric Oxide

**Andrew Murray:** Let's look at a lifelong strategy to prevent that likelihood of occurring. Given that you're saying it's very much stress-related, how would you look at avoiding that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at stress, falling blood sugar and rising lactic acid are universal features. It happens that lactic acid is the main signal for producing the endorphins, the endogenous opiates. The effects of stress are very closely associated with an excess and prolonged production of the endogenous opiates. Everything that is uncomfortable will increase your tendency to overproduce lactic acid—hyperventilating from anxiety, for example. When your carbon dioxide goes down, your lactic acid goes up. Strangely, the endorphins didn't get any of the bad connotations of morphine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You hear the word endorphin and you think, gosh, it's good.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A study at University of California in San Diego in the dermatology department experimentally gave people massages and measured their various stress hormones. They saw that massaging *lowered* the beta-endorphin. Pain or overexertion—anything that interferes with the energy supply—will increase the opiates or endorphins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you would think that having a massage would increase your endorphins, when in reality, it's the opposite, which is good because endorphins are not good.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And everything you do that's good pleasure, such as the massage, will have that same effect of protecting you against the endorphins and nitric oxide. So low dose naloxone or naltrexone treatment has a wide range of anti-stress effects, including protection against promotion of cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the happy factor too, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, serotonin and endorphins are often called the happy hormones, but actually they are the most important mediators of stress. Even though estrogen turns on lactic acid, endorphins, and nitric oxide, the endorphins in turn activate estrogen receptors, aromatase, and prolactin, which acts as an amplifier of estrogen's effect. You get this back-and-forth action increasing inflammation, estrogenicity, and lowering energy production.

## Dietary Aromatase Inhibitors

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What can we do to lower this estrogen with our diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The foods that naturally contain anti-aromatases are very important. I always mention orange juice and guavas, but there are lots of fruits and vegetables that contain similar chemicals.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The naringenin is found in orange juice but also in higher levels in the skins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both the juice and the peeling contain the protective things. So marmalade is another source of protective substances.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And what about apigenin? That's another aromatase inhibitor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think guavas, celery, and parsley are highest sources of that.

**Andrew Murray:** And COX2 inhibitors were another rationale for blocking aromatase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For about 20 years I've been mentioning aspirin as probably the safest first thing that anyone who worries about breast cancer should start. It is a very effective way to turn off estrogen production and response to estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People with aggressive cancer probably should take 4 to 6 grams. In that case, they also need to take Vitamin K to prevent a bleeding problem.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You have to use a milligram—not a microgram—of Vitamin K for every normal standard aspirin tablet, which is 325mg.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to bring out a couple of plant-based aromatase inhibitors. Mistletoe has been shown to be an aromatase inhibitor. Do you know much about mistletoe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 50 years ago I ran into some anthroposophy people who got me interested in it. I've followed the research on it, but I don't think anything very new has turned up.

**Andrew Murray:** You also mentioned white button mushrooms last month.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Chinese study found that the women who had at least 10 grams a day on average had extremely low cancer mortality—like 88% lower—especially if they had green tea too.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Normal black tea too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, coffee and tea.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There was a caller who called in about black cohosh. That is an estrogenic herb. I would not recommend that for treatment or use with patients with breast cancer, nor to prevent breast cancer.

## Treatment vs. Waiting

**Andrew Murray:** People that are going through breast cancer treatment—chemotherapy, radiotherapy—it's just not doing it, is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a website by Gershom Zajicek. He has written some very good articles on the issue of when and whether to treat certain types of cancer. From the time of Hippocrates, I think Hippocrates said that internal cancer patients who are not treated will last a long time, but those who are treated die quickly. Gershom Zajicek makes a similar point. And 50 years ago, a Berkeley professor, Hardin Jones, did a study and clearly showed that the longer a person waits before treating a cancer, the longer they live.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** There was that study that showed 95% of people over the age of 50 had some form of abdominal cancer upon autopsy if they died of unrelated reasons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another person said that looking at all of the organs, 100% of people by the age of 50 have diagnosable cancer somewhere.

## Caller: Cruciferous Vegetables

**Caller (Garberville):** I have a question about skunky vegetables—cabbage, brussels sprouts. I thought I understood that there's a lot of estrogen in those vegetables naturally.

**Andrew Murray:** They certainly contain lots of sulfur compounds.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They are so thyroid suppressive that they allow estrogen to build up naturally in men and women because men actually usually have a lot higher levels of estrogen than women. But are they directly estrogenic, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are some studies in animals showing a direct estrogenic effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Those are commonly touted as breast cancer preventative.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would say that sometimes they probably do have good effects, but I would wait for more research on them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you're still listening, caller, you can cook your kale, which is the most nutritious out of all of them, very well. Cook it with lots of coconut oil and you will reduce some of the thyroid suppressive effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On the topic of stress and cancer, about 15 or 20 years ago, Carl Simonton was in the news recommending emotional therapy or changing your attitude to reduce stress as a way to improve survival. He was a radiation treater of cancer and noticed that with the same treatment, his patients who were cheerier lived longer. Later, a group at Stanford and UC Berkeley did a study in which one group of women with advanced breast cancer were given some kind of emotional counseling. The ones with the counseling lived twice as long.

## Caller: Raw vs. Cooked Vegetables

**Caller (Garberville):** I always heard that cruciferous vegetables were very anti-cancer and good for the colon. I tend to like to eat a lot of raw cabbage in salad. Is it better if you cook it?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It suppresses your basic energy currency of your body, your body's ability to use oxygen. If it's raw, it's very potent. Actual thyroid drugs used to treat hyperactive thyroid have the same exact compound that's in cabbage juice. So raw cabbage is particularly harmful to your energy metabolism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But leaves in general can stimulate the intestine, so it has a speedier transit and that reduces the recycling of estrogen. The liver excretes estrogen in the bile, and if you have slow transit or tend to be constipated, then much of that estrogen is reabsorbed and circulates again in the body.

**Caller (Garberville):** So if you eat cabbage, it can make everything move through your intestines more quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. But there are safer things you can eat to get your intestines moving, like raw grated carrot. You could eat spinach or chard that you cook with a little bit of baking soda.

**Caller (Garberville):** What about raw foods? I heard that they have good enzymes and help digest the cooked food.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is always the risk that since humans can't digest cellulose at all, but bacteria can, the uncooked food is great for bacterial replication but very poor for human nutrition.

**Caller (Garberville):** What about fresh fruit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The low fiber fruits are very good.

**Caller (Garberville):** But you don't think raw vegetables are good?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Only raw carrot, because the bacteria can't digest the raw carrot fiber like they can other fibers.

**Caller (Garberville):** Why do we keep hearing that one of the best things to eat to prevent cancer is the cruciferous vegetables?

**Andrew Murray:** Unfortunate misinformation. Why do we keep hearing that HRT is supposed to be protective for your bones? Why do we keep hearing that sugar is bad for you?

I think we have to call that the evening. I want to sum the show up by saying that what you've heard this evening, have a rethink about it. It's so easy to get brainwashed by media and by companies producing products. It's very important that you do your own research because you will find the truth out there. Dr. Peat has spent most of his life researching either directly or looking at peer-reviewed papers.
