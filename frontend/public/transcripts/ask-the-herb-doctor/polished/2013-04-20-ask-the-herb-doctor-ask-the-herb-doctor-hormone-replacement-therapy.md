## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herbal extracts.

Tonight, you are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's topic: hormone replacement therapy (HRT), estrogen, and its inflammatory effects, as well as other popularly accepted hormones like serotonin, melatonin, and 5-HTP. We will discuss why these materials are not actually that good for us. We are very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who will be sharing his research and knowledge surrounding these topics.

Science, whilst responsible for many excellent breakthroughs, is unfortunately subject to the same scandals that beset many excellent thoughts. While studying physiology myself, I was subject to what I now understand as an indoctrination into an erroneous state of pseudo-fact. One of those things was the receptor model used in physiology with one particular hormone, namely estrogen. This has been a perpetrator of much deceit on behalf of Big Pharma. Why was HRT so promoted, and how did the truth behind estrogen's effects get so covered up?

Thank you once again, Dr. Peat, for joining us. Would you open up with your scientific background?

## Scientific Indoctrination and Background

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As a kid, I was interested in science, but I would read old medical books and encyclopedias. I very early got the impression that education was largely indoctrination. I found that literature as an undergraduate was a field where I could see the actual evidence—the material we were studying—without the interpretation of the professors.

It was years later that I finally decided to go to graduate school in science, when I realized I could get through it without having to fight with the professors; I could just be quiet and do what I wanted to do. I enrolled at the University of Oregon in the biology department, starting by specializing in nerve biology. I was interested in how the brain could do things like handling language and images. I saw that the whole direction of brain biology was towards a very reductionist computer analogy.

Looking around the department, I saw that the other end of the organism—reproductive physiology—was much more scientific. So, I shifted over to that specialization. My professor would say, "If it's repeatable, just go ahead." But in the nerve biology section, if the results or the interpretation were a little off, you had to throw away the evidence.

## The History of Estrogen and Miscarriage

**Andrew Murray:** The word "indoctrination" is a very good place to start regarding the scandal surrounding HRT. When I was studying, the receptor-ligand interaction was dogmatic. However, you have a very good understanding of the enzymatic background before it was taken over by Big Pharma. The whole estrogen receptor concept is a bit of a non-entity, I understand.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was 1970 when I was working on my dissertation. I was studying the metabolism of the uterus in aging animals, trying to understand why infertility came about in middle age. The particular metabolic studies I was doing corresponded to increased estrogenic stimulation with aging.

All the current textbooks in the 1960s were saying that menopause is when the ovaries wear out and stop producing estrogen. So, I read way back to about 1900 and up to the 1940s. I saw there was a sudden change in 1942. All through the 1930s and into the 1940s, people like Soderwall and Blandau were studying the effects of excess estrogen on the uterus. They showed that increasing amounts of estrogen caused miscarriage. The smallest dose would cause miscarriage at a very early stage, and if you waited until very late in the pregnancy, it would take a bigger dose. But it was a continuous, graded effect in which a slight excess of estrogen was sufficient to kill the developing embryo.

The hormones of the ovary were identified in the mid-1930s. The major substance produced in the ovary was progesterone, and estrogen was a minor substance. However, people doing research on how estrogen worked saw that if you put a spoon in a candle flame and then extracted the soot in a solvent, you could get hundreds of different estrogenic substances out of just soot. This was wonderful for the drug industries because everyone could find an estrogen to patent. But there was only one natural progesterone, so that was not a viable drug because no one had a patent on it.

By 1942, the 13 major estrogen companies had their synthetic estrogens. The scientific situation was that estrogen caused infertility and was associated with aging. But since they had products, they said, "Here we have the female hormone. Being female means being able to have babies, so estrogen must be what causes women to have babies." They wanted to sell it for popular use to millions of women. They came up with the idea that it would prevent miscarriage, even though the science said the opposite.

They got a team at Harvard to promote the idea that Diethylstilbestrol (DES) would prevent miscarriages. They were prescribing it for years to prevent miscarriage and make a "healthier baby." It turned out that DES causes cancer and deformity and actually increases the risk of miscarriage.

Just as it was being recognized that DES was causing miscarriages and cancer, they were getting interested in a new product: the birth control pill. By 1959 or 1960, contraception was becoming acceptable. So, they invented a story saying that if you take estrogen, it will suppress your body's estrogen and prevent miscarriage by lowering your estrogen. They came out with the contraceptive pill just as it was recognized that DES was causing cancer. They lost one product but immediately came out with another falsified story to sell the birth control pills.

## The Receptor Dogma vs. Enzymology

**Andrew Murray:** What is the truth behind whether or not estrogen binds to a specific receptor, and the lies surrounding the science produced to support the estrogen industry?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people doing the real science were trying to explain why estrogen had these toxic effects. They saw that natural estrogen was imitated by these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot, which were famous carcinogens. They were studying the properties of soot and estrogens and finding that the substance tended to produce inflammation and cancer—a very close association electronically in the nature of the molecule. These were activating enzyme systems in particular ways.

This reached a peak in the 1950s. The government moved some of their investment from chemical warfare into endocrine research. A project was funded for Elwood Jensen, who had been working in chemical warfare. He wanted to create a new idea for how estrogen worked that would not involve all of this interesting chemistry explaining why estrogen was a toxin and carcinogen. He wanted to say that all it does is activate the "female genes." He argued that it's like a lock and key: the female organs have a very specific lock, and the estrogen is a key that sticks only into that lock.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And estrogen receptors are now known to be found all throughout the body, and in men.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But at that time, Elwood Jensen was arguing that there was just one little switch molecule in the cell which would neatly turn on only the female genes, so it wouldn't have the possibility of any of these other actions. The Atomic Energy Commission gave him permission to use radioactive isotopes. His competition didn't have the grants or the isotopes.

He labeled estrogen and found that it concentrated in organs like the uterus. The enzymologists were saying that estrogen affects the whole energy system of the organism and the cell, participating in the chemistry of the cell. Jensen labeled two different kinds of estrogen and said there was no interchange between the two and no oxidative reactions in which estrogen participated. He published that in 1962. He had the only means to demonstrate what he claimed, so his opponents couldn't disprove it.

However, 10 or 15 years later, after the receptor dogma had been imposed on the world of biology, other people started using isotopes and showing that, yes, the older enzymologists were exactly right. Estrogen does participate as a catalyst in enzyme reactions, especially transhydrogenation reactions that connect energy production to gene turnover and cell growth.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's how it initiates cancer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It allows the energy to be short-circuited over into the growth rather than the function mechanism.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the cell stops doing its normal cellular functioning and just turns on the cell growth processes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it drains the energy right out of function into growth.

## Estrogen and Water Structure

**Andrew Murray:** I'm interested in water. Modern science has shown that H2O exists in many different states. How does estrogen involved in redox reactions affect water in a way that promotes cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fastest change you can see in a cell within a minute or two of exposing it to estrogen is that it instantly starts taking up water. As it takes up water, the water gets out of the cell's control. That's part of this short-circuiting of the energy process. The microtubules, which are an organizing force in the cell that lets it do the work it's supposed to, are depolymerized in the presence of estrogen and disorganized.

That's part of the cancer problem—the cell can't communicate from one part to the other because the microtubules are messed up. The division process can reach the point where it can't separate the chromosomes evenly, leading to an imbalance of chromosomes. The water is normally under the control of adjoining surfaces, very unlike bulk water. But in the presence of estrogen, it becomes bulk-like. One of my experiments at the university was to put an old uterus, a young uterus, and an estrogen-treated uterus in an MRI machine. We showed that the old uterus and the estrogen-treated uterus had loose, disorganized water that could be distinguished from the young, healthy uterus.

## HRT, Prolactin, and Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** Give me your opinion of HRT's effects and why it was eventually taken out—or rather, why there was a backlash against it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The industry succeeded so greatly in turning science completely upside down in the case of estrogen that it took a lot of other hormones with it. Progesterone was suppressed and ignored because it would cure the things that estrogen was claimed to cure but actually caused.

Prolactin had many toxic effects that were well recognized. But since estrogen increases prolactin, there was great pressure not to think about the fact that prolactin causes bone loss and contributes to osteoporosis.

Serotonin is another thing that has been strongly influenced by this inverted interpretation. Estrogen increases exposure to serotonin. Serotonin is one of the means by which estrogen increases prolactin. Serotonin does many of the harmful things that estrogen and prolactin do, including being a direct cause of bone loss. People who take the fluoxetine (Prozac) type of antidepressants are seen to have a lot of premature bone loss because of the excess exposure to serotonin.

Serotonin is, in a way, a co-factor for estrogen. Estrogen increases prolactin or serotonin systemically, and serotonin in turn increases the production of estrogen. So when one gets out of control, they both tend to become dominant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We're all told that serotonin is the "feel good" hormone and they give you SSRIs to make you feel better. Is this the same brainwashing they did with estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. One of the currently bad effects of serotonin excess that is getting some recognition is hypertension of the pulmonary artery. The drugs that increase serotonin increase this pulmonary hypertension and degeneration of the valves in the right side of the heart. This was known in the 1950s as the main deadly complication of having a serotonin-producing tumor. Finally, 60 years later, it's being recognized as a way to treat pulmonary hypertension by using *anti*-serotonin drugs.

## Caller: 5-HTP and Depression

**Caller:** I sometimes have a tendency toward depression and I like to do natural things. I resisted trying Zoloft or Prozac. I was told by some nature doctors to try 5-HTP. They said it was natural and would help you use your own serotonin better. Is that good for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Prozac-type drugs keep the platelets and nerve cells from binding and keeping serotonin out of the way, leading to overexposure. Plain tryptophan is bad enough, but 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is one step closer to being serotonin.

**Caller:** So you think it's not good for me to take it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything that I know suggests that. For example, there's increased risk of breast cancer and obesity and many bad effects.

**Caller:** How can it increase obesity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By slowing metabolism and suppressing the thyroid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's basically providing the precursor, and your body makes more serotonin out of it. The effects of serotonin in excess are going to be increasing estrogen, which slows your liver's metabolism. That can slow your thyroid down, lead to obesity, and promote cancer.

**Caller:** It says it elevates your mood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You have to weigh it up. It might elevate your mood, but you also risk these other things. They used to give X-rays to help with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and people got cancer.

**Caller:** I certainly don't want to slow my metabolism or my thyroid down. I'm done with menopause, so I figure my estrogen has balanced itself out. I don't need to increase my serotonin if it's going to be bad for my heart valve.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Exactly. And when Dr. Peat says that, it's not just his opinion; he has adopted that opinion from researching the evidence.

**Caller:** So I should probably do without it and see if my food is okay anyway?

**Andrew Murray:** Sounds like a good idea.

## Caller: Asthma and Serotonin

**Caller:** I've talked to you before and I've gotten completely off of my serotonin reuptake inhibitors. I read a bunch of articles on your site. One effect of stopping these Prozac and serotonin things is that I've now been able to stop using steroids in an inhaler. My asthma has gone away completely.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen is related to asthma too. The effect of the serotonin is to cause localized contraction of the tubes in your lungs as well as causing them to take up water and promote inflammation. But the contraction is the thing that's best studied in connection with asthma.

**Caller:** That's really interesting because it went away within four weeks. Getting off the serotonin was painful, but I'm off of it now for almost two months. Thank you for the information.

## Caller: Types of Estrogen

**Caller:** I haven't heard mention of the three different types of estrogen in our bodies. They have a hugely disparate impact on our bodies. Please inform us of that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are probably a dozen important types of estrogen, but the three main types—estriol, estrone, and estradiol—are the best known. Those all have pretty much the same effects but at different potencies. If you can turn your most potent estradiol into the others, you're protected against some of the most toxic effects. During pregnancy, enzymes are detoxifying estrogen by many different routes. The index of a healthy pregnancy is when the estriol is high because that means you're destroying your estradiol very quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the estradiol is the most dangerous form.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And these different forms are exactly the issue that Elwood Jensen denied happened. He said estradiol can't turn into estrone and estriol, but in fact, that's a major way of activating or inactivating estrogen according to the cell's energy system.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the only reason you'd want high estriol is because that would tell us that the estradiol is being detoxified, not that high estriol in itself is protective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's about 10 times weaker than estrogen. So every little bit of estradiol that you turn to estriol is a down-stepping of your estrogen effect.

## Caller: Birth Control Safety

**Caller:** What is your opinion of modern birth control methods like the pill or the NuvaRing? Do you recommend those as safe contraceptives?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They tremendously decreased the amount of estrogen in the contraceptives, but if it's strong enough to kill the embryo, it's strong enough to do some damage to the woman.

About 30 years ago, there was agitation among women's groups for FDA approval of the traditional cervical cap. The ideal thing was made by a metal worker or a dentist; they would cast silver or gold in the shape of the cervix, and it would form a vacuum seal and could be left in place for weeks. Under pressure, the FDA gave its approval to a rubber "cervical cap," which was actually shaped more like a baby bottle's nipple. It was terribly unsuccessful. The FDA approved that but wouldn't approve the one that actually worked.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And as far as the IUD, they now have IUDs that secrete a small amount of hormone inside the uterine cavity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The signal from inside the uterus travels through nerves up the fallopian tube to prevent the ovary from producing the amount of progesterone that it should. So any kind of IUD, with or without hormones, will create a hormonal imbalance, which is the main thing accounting for the prevention of pregnancy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And then thereby increasing your estrogen and increasing risk of cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** So the only possible safe method would be the silver or gold cap, but they don't make them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the rhythm cycle method is the best.

## Melatonin

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think of melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has its own endocrine problems. It can disturb your progesterone and thyroid production if you take a lot of it. But its function seems to be as a way of detoxifying serotonin. The trigger that turns the conversion in the pineal gland of serotonin into melatonin is the adrenergic stress-related nerves. During the night, your stress increases from the lack of light, and this adrenergic system causes the pineal to convert serotonin to melatonin.

In general, melatonin is functioning as an antidote to serotonin. Biologically, it's evidence that you're responding to stress with a detoxifying process. The enzymes that exist in the pineal that are activated by the stress can also be found in inflamed joint tissue and in breast cancer. Serotonin is involved in the pathology of both of those situations. If our enzymes could turn it more quickly into melatonin, there would be less of a serotonin problem.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But when people actually take melatonin supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's probably protecting against the circulating serotonin. But in itself, in an otherwise healthy person, animal studies showed it was capable of lowering both progesterone and thyroid while increasing estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in a short-term emergency situation, it could be okay, but long-term it's going to have negative side effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that depends on the person, but it's much safer than serotonin.

## Caller: Vagifem and Dryness

**Caller:** I take a suppository called Vagifem for dryness. It says it's estradiol. Should I worry about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have been studied who were using vaginal creams, and their blood level of estrogen was even higher than some of the oral pills were causing. So it's definitely a systemic hormonal influence, wherever you put it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, what would you recommend to this lady to use in place of her suppository?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known several women who had pharmacists make them up suppositories with a fairly high dose of Vitamin A and a little Vitamin E in cocoa butter. The Vitamin A helps to strengthen the membranes and normalize mucus production.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And in the meantime, if you can't find a pharmacist to make it, you can buy Vitamin A palmitate and Vitamin E capsules and try that.

## Caller: Bioidentical Hormones

**Caller:** What do you think of bioidentical hormones in low doses? They come from wild yams.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the hormones that are bioidentical have to fit into the system in a balanced way. It's okay to have a physiological amount of any of these, but when you supplement estrogen or serotonin, you're most likely increasing something that's already excessive.

The doctrine of replacement with natural hormones is building on the history of estrogen replacement with synthetic hormones. What they neglect is that as a woman ages from 19 to 39, there's a steady average increase in the amount of estrogen in her bloodstream. In the 40s, progesterone production is no longer able to fully keep up with this steadily increasing estrogen production.

As soon as progesterone decreases and can no longer force estrogen out of the cells, the blood estrogen level will drop, but the estrogen *inside* the cells will increase. Publications have shown that the tissues of old organisms retain much more estrogen than the tissues of young animals. The fact that you don't find it in the blood is simply because estrogen sticks inside the cells in proportion to the deficiency of progesterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that was probably the reason why they recommended it—because of low blood levels. And so Dr. Peat's advice would be to not use it.

## Conclusion
