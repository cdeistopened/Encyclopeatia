## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows before, we run them every third Friday of the month from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM. We are both licensed practitioners of herbal medicine. We qualified in England in 2000 and 1999 and have been practicing herbal medicine ever since. We were very pleased to discover Dr. Raymond Peat back in 2008 serendipitously through a breast cancer survivor who was praising him and his protocols. That piqued my wife's interest, she made contact, and the rest is history. Dr. Peat has been sharing his time every third Friday of the month for about 11 years now.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, could you introduce yourself before we get into the subject of this evening? We will be discussing the science and principles behind a mechanistic determinant of cancer described as MTOR (MTOR1 and MTOR2). We will get into the biology of it, how it was discovered in the early 90s, and how it has been targeted in the suppression of cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After studying and teaching for about 10 years in the humanities, I decided to go back to graduate school at the University of Oregon for a PhD in biology, reproductive physiology, and biochemistry. Since 1972, I've been doing a lot of personal consulting. For 40 years, since 1981, I've been writing a newsletter—at first every month, and now quarterly—developing themes that relate to health, aging, fertility, and the nature of life.

**Andrew Murray:** The background of your life was the scientific investigation into aging and reproduction. You've always looked deeper into the cause and effect of what we are taught.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason I waited until 1968 to do any academic study in biology was that already in the late 1940s and 50s, I had decided that genetics was based on fraudulent, make-believe science. If you really read the classical papers that molecular biology is based on, there's just no real science there. It's a belief attaching experiments to the belief.

## Estrogen, Progesterone, and Cancer Risks

**Andrew Murray:** Before we get into the topic of this evening and the discovery of rapamycin, I want to touch on your views regarding estrogen. You have spoken about the unscrupulous estrogen industry and how estrogen is the prime causative factor behind many different cancers, not just reproductive cancers. The inflammatory effects of estrogen trigger excitotoxic states within cells, disorganizing their energy and allowing spontaneous tumors to arise. You have been a big advocate of the antithesis of estrogen, which is progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having a child fairly early in life is a huge protection against getting cancer. Animal studies show that if a rabbit is bred starting early and as often as it can for the rest of its life, its tissues at any old age are much younger than if it had been a virgin all those years. That was backed up by looking at the relation between the number of children per woman in Hungary. There was a straight increase in longevity with the number of babies, up to eight.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to remind listeners that estrogen is not just a female hormone; males are also subject to the effects of estrogen, especially with aging. In England, with the pub culture, you see gynecomastia—male breast enlargement—and belly fat in older males. This is an outward expression of estrogen dominance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Old men typically have more estrogen than women. It’s not just the ratio; their testosterone is being massively converted to estrogen by the time they're 65 or 70.

**Andrew Murray:** The enzyme aromatase is expressed in many different cells in the body—liver, placenta, bones, and breast tissue. This converts testosterone to estrone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 1940s, one experimenter implanted a very small dose of estrogen in animals that had their ovaries removed. The tiniest amount of uninterrupted estrogen produced cancer in every tissue. But if you interrupted it periodically, even a large amount of estrogen didn't lead to cancer. Similar to the aging rabbits or Hungarian women, the quantity and regularity of the progesterone interruption of estrogen just about completely protects against the development of cancer.

## MTOR and Rapamycin

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to the activity of the enzyme MTOR. This is described as the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin or the Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin. There are two subclades: MTOR1 and MTOR2. Could you describe MTOR, its discovery, and what has happened since 1993?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This particular antibiotic, rapamycin, was used as a fungus killer. It is broad-spectrum but especially effective against fungus. It happens to be in the same family of antibiotics as azithromycin and erythromycin. It is a ring structure, and those are known to have an amazing spectrum of activity. This class of antibiotics happens to kill viruses as well as fungus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After it was discovered to be a treatment for fungus infections, it was found to have many other effects, such as anti-inflammatory effects. In exploring how the anti-inflammatory effect works, they found that it was acting on a particular kinase—an enzyme that attaches phosphate groups to functional proteins. This phosphorylation directs it towards growth and inflammation. They found that the antibiotic inhibiting this particular phosphorylating enzyme extended lifespan drastically and reduced cancer and inflammatory diseases.

**Andrew Murray:** So, the wastage of energy is common in inflammatory diseases, aging, diabetes, and cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The target of this antibiotic, rapamycin (also called sirolimus), controls energy flow. An abundance of energy intake—especially fats and proteins—are the normal activators of MTOR complex number one. Growth hormone is a major activator of MTOR complex two, which is insensitive to the antibiotics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For matters of diet and treatment, the attention is mostly on MTOR complex one because there are so many foods that activate it. Methionine is probably the main activator of MTOR. Meat, besides being a major source of methionine, is also a major source of iron. It happens that both iron and phosphate are activators of MTOR complex one.

**Andrew Murray:** What about milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Although milk contains a lot of methionine, it happens that parathyroid hormone is an activator of MTOR. Milk's high calcium content, working with vitamin D, lowers parathyroid hormone. So, milk contains its own antidote working against the toxic effects of methionine via the great concentration of calcium and a very low concentration of phosphate and iron.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, Dr. Peat and Andrew, are you suggesting that MTOR is a trigger for cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Cancer, inflammation, aging degeneration like arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, rapamycin is an antifungal antibiotic that blocks MTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And therefore they're finding anti-cancer benefit of the rapamycin because it's blocking the MTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's now used, or derivatives are used, in treating various cancers—breast cancer, pancreas cancer, prostate cancer, and so on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is it true that they found it on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in a soil sample?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep.

**Andrew Murray:** The main thrust of this discussion is about the potential use of substances—drugs or phytochemicals—that block MTOR and how that can be used in a dietary perspective to suppress cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee is a source of flavonoids like quercetin and caffeine; both of those are anti-MTOR agents. Orange juice and other fruits are very effective flavonoid sources for reducing MTOR.

## Diet, Estrogen Metabolism, and Inflammation

**Michael (Station Host):** I have a question. You started giving a list of foods that support bad MTOR and reduce it. I learned about the metabolism of estrogen where different foods switch your metabolism so the byproduct is less bad. Are there foods that would help men if they are converting their testosterone to estrogen? And are there any foods that could get men to convert their testosterone back to progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think back-conversion can happen. Progesterone is a precursor to the glucocorticoids like cortisol, but it doesn't go down the pathway towards either testosterone or estrogen. The precursor to those is DHEA.

**Andrew Murray:** How about aromatase inhibitors to block estrogen production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just about everything that's good for you tends to inhibit aromatase because it's activated by stress, cortisol, and prostaglandins, and inhibited by progesterone. All of the things associated with inflammation and degeneration—for example, angiotensin—work through MTOR. If you block angiotensin, you help lower MTOR. All estrogens promote MTOR; progesterone inhibits it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do even the weaker estrogens like estrone stimulate MTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they all add up to the same estrogen effect. But estradiol is at least 10 times stronger than the next one. Progesterone activates the detoxifying enzyme system that adds either glucuronic acid or sulfuric acid to the estrogen so that it can be excreted. It also blocks the enzyme that would turn estrone into estradiol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's working on three different pathways to help block the estradiol. Do you recommend men who are converting testosterone into estradiol use progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee, progesterone, flavonoids, and aspirin. Aspirin is a major MTOR inhibitor and aromatase inhibitor.

**Andrew Murray:** So essentially, most anti-inflammatories will have that blocking activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not everything. For example, doctors prescribe Tylenol instead of aspirin. But in fact, Tylenol activates MTOR and increases inflammatory degenerative processes. Its antidote is aspirin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** With anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and Tylenol, they actually increase your risk of stroke. They do not decrease it like aspirin does.

**Michael (Station Host):** Would glutathione be as bad as methionine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, too much glutathione activates MTOR.

## Flavonoids and MTOR Inhibitors

**Andrew Murray:** I want to list some specific flavonoids and herbs that block MTOR.
*   **Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG):** From green tea.
*   **Caffeine:** Another flavonoid useful for blocking MTOR.
*   **Curcumin:** From turmeric.
*   **Berberine:** Found in Goldenseal and Oregon Grape root.
*   **Quercetin:** Found in onions (onion syrup), nettles, and pomegranate.
*   **Resveratrol:** From Japanese Knotweed and grape skins.
*   **Pterostilbene:** Found in blueberries and red grapes.
*   **Fisetin:** Found in apples, strawberries, and persimmons. Used in treating melanoma.

Dr. Peat, regarding calorie restriction and fasting—how do we achieve a low MTOR diet without turning into a skeleton?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think calorie restriction is necessary. What slows down the metabolic rate after age 20 is the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) primarily. That shifts our metabolism to prefer the oxidation of fat rather than glucose. If you are oxidizing glucose at a high rate, the resulting carbon dioxide is our basic anti-inflammatory substance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The aim is to prevent the shift towards oxidizing fatty acids. In diabetes and cancer, you fail to oxidize glucose and instead oxidize fatty acids, leading to inflammation. Instead of inhibiting MTOR with carbon dioxide, you activate it with lactic acid. If you can keep away from the stress that causes you to oxidize fatty acids preferentially, you avoid turning on the MTOR complex one.

**Michael (Station Host):** How much glutathione would be too much in a day? And could you list some protein sources similar to milk so that you get protein without pushing MTOR up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think calcium is what makes the big difference between milk and other proteins.

**Michael (Station Host):** So a bone broth sort of thing would be better?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, gelatin. Naturally extracted gelatin, like chicken skin and bone broth with the fat skimmed off. That contains a very low level of methionine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And it contains the amino acid glycine, which has lots of other health benefits.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding glutathione: it is a reductant. If you increase the reductive balance of cells, you're putting them in the worst kind of stress—the aging degenerative condition. Glutathione is the cell's major anti-free radical detoxifying agent, but to add it as a food is very risky and I think almost 100% likely to be harmful rather than helpful.

## Caller Question: Dentistry

**Caller (Queens, NY):** I have an off-topic question. Dr. Peat, what is your opinion on wisdom tooth extractions and root canals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the pulp is infected, it's probably good to put in a safe filling material like calcium hydroxide and let the immune system take over once you've cleaned out the infection. But I don't think it's good to pull any tooth that isn't an ongoing issue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you pull a molar of a rat, they lose cognitive ability just from the extraction of one molar. The brain is participating everywhere in the body. You can't separate body metabolism from brain metabolism.

**Caller (Queens, NY):** I currently have a wisdom tooth with a big cavity. Dentists just want to extract it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can control the pain by scraping out the decayed material and sticking in a temporary filling—for example, zinc and eugenol makes a plastic that hardens—it reduces pain and stops infection. If your wisdom tooth isn't doing any biting work, a temporary filling would probably take care of it.

**Andrew Murray:** Just as an aside, we found a very good holistic dentist in Medford, Oregon, named Dr. Tanner. He doesn't use injections to numb anything before doing a cavity, and he is very skilled. I encourage you to find a naturopathic dentist.
