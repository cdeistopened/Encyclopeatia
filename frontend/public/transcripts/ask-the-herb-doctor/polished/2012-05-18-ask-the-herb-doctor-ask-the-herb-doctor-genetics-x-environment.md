## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of genetics versus environmental predisposition to disease. We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat on the show tonight. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining the show again. Several months ago, a listener sent us an email suggesting a few things they would like to hear your opinion on, and they conform with tonight's subject. First, for those who have never heard you, Dr. Peat, would you briefly outline your academic career?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon in 1972. But I had been reading in biology since the late 1940s and avoided academic study because I saw that strange things were happening that didn't seem at all scientific to me. Even as a kid, it was very clear that political doctrines were influencing biological theories.

## The Dogma of Genetic Determinism

**Andrew Murray:** Onto the question of the fairly dogmatic, entrenched view that our genes control everything. We are told we are at the mercy of our genes, and if we are genetically predisposed to a disease, we are essentially doomed. I want your opinion on the current model versus alternative, scientifically founded ways of looking at biology—specifically the role of genes versus the environment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The federal government is really involved in this issue. I was horrified when I discovered that the National Library of Medicine maintains an online version of a book called *Mendelian Inheritance in Man*. I bought a copy for 50 cents at a used bookstore just for the humor of it because it's totally absurd. Basing genetic determinism of a disease on two cases—a single family, for example—is enough to prove to the author that there was genetic determinism involved. This neglects the possibility that both people in the family were exposed to the same chemical toxin or the same diet.

Just about the time I was starting to read biology, the government was starting to get involved in helping the dogmatists control biological teaching. Carl Lindegren wrote a book called *The Cold War in Biology* that explained how the change took place in the 1940s. People who didn't conform to the dogma weren't allowed to teach, even in high schools. It was a very totalitarian institution, with the government as a funding agency and the science journals being influenced by the pharmaceutical industry.

In the first half of the 20th century, the embryological view of development and inheritance was defining how a single cell becomes an adult. It does this by proceeding through many stages of organization. The guiding principle for the first 50 years of the century was that a "field" was involved—a gradient field of chemicals, electrical forces, or other physical forces. They could demonstrate that there was a field effect; if you removed a part, the surrounding conditions constituted a force that would create a replacement part—regeneration—according to the place in the field rather than what the cells had done up to that moment. The idea of genes reading out mechanically, as if from a blueprint, was clearly disproved by the embryologists. But that whole idea of a morphogenetic developmental field disappeared about 1960. The last advocates retired between 1950 and 1960.

**Andrew Murray:** So you think a lot of the stagnation was brought around by vested interests in medicine guiding the dogma of genetics to produce a controllable scenario where drugs can be introduced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you can't find a drug that will neutralize a gene's product, then you have something to blame the disease on. It explains why doctors are powerless—it's "incurable" if it's genetic—unless the drug companies can come up with something to alleviate the symptoms.

But the actual evidence of how genes relate to health is really a complete fantasy. By the 1930s to 1960s, the idea of a "gene" was recognized as a metaphysical construct, even less based on evidence than the idea of a field. Even though they didn't know exactly what the elements of the field were, they could demonstrate it. The gene idea was simply an abstraction until they applied it to certain stretches of DNA. But even the definition of a gene has been changing since the recognition of DNA as a component of inheritance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did they want to tell us that if they can't help us because there's no drug, then it's just a genetic disease? It takes the power out of the person to help themselves.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was a very conscious ideology. Konrad Lorenz, who won the Nobel Prize, was a hero of practically all the professors I knew even into the 70s. He was a Nazi who designed his idea that genes control behavior specifically for Hitler's Institute of Racial Hygiene. It was an excuse for killing people who didn't have the behavioral traits they thought were appropriate.

The American view of eugenics had been mostly to sterilize—sometimes they would euthanize babies—but mostly it was used to sterilize people they considered defective. That political idea of genetics derived right from the end of the 19th century. Mendel and August Weismann were consciously trying to destroy the Darwinian or Lamarckian ideas that the environment might be able to improve the intelligence of poor people. They wanted an absolute determinism stating that people of lower intelligence were simply permanent; their children would inherit their traits. It was used to justify everything in society, not just particular sicknesses.

For example, it was applied to toxemia of pregnancy. The fetus was said to have a genetic defect which was poisoning the mother. This denied that better diet could control or prevent pregnancy complications because all of it was "genetically determined." The Scopes trial, in which William Jennings Bryan argued against evolution, was basically him arguing against eugenics, which was justified by the theory of a mechanical kind of evolution.

## How Much Do Genes Actually Control?

**Andrew Murray:** How much do genetics actually affect the organism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are several conditions that are distinctly controlled by particular genes, such as the type of dwarfism in which the bones don't develop. There is a definite gene mutation involved. But that doesn't say that the environment hasn't created that mutation in a particular, controllable way.

One way of looking at genetic uniqueness is that every organism requires a certain environment. A frog can't live in the same place an eagle can live. Certain genes make you need more things from the environment. But even the genes that limit you can create a stress reaction, and the stress reaction can lead to changes in the genes. Evidence has been accumulating in universities among well-known researchers demonstrating that stress can produce directional changes in microorganisms. This uses mechanisms similar to what Barbara McClintock recognized in corn: mobile genetic elements that move around under stress and accelerate the ability to adapt.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So our environment is constantly having an effect upon our DNA, and our cells are constantly sensing a change in environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** James Shapiro was one of the people who discovered that bacteria can adapt to resist antibiotics, and they can pass on that acquired resistance to their descendants or to other bacteria they interact with. It can be transmitted both genetically and horizontally as an acquired trait. Shapiro calls this "natural genetic engineering," in which the organism is adjusting its own inheritance to improve its survival.

## Environmental Causes of "Genetic" Diseases

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss some diseases considered genetic by today's thinking which are probably more environmental, like prion diseases and Huntington's chorea.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are considered degenerative diseases as well as genetic. Huntington's disease typically becomes apparent when the person is maybe 40 years old. They were perfectly healthy—some say healthier than average—up until the disease set in. When you look at the specific gene involved in Huntington's, it's a protein that gets an extra inserted stretch of glutamine residues. This can change generation after generation, so the victim's offspring can develop it years earlier than the parent. It can change quickly, indicating something is actively contributing to the mutation.

However, the folding doesn't become a problem for 40 years. The factors known to activate the folding problem that creates the symptoms are environmental things accumulating over decades. These are now being identified. For example, unsaturated fatty acids cause misfolding of the prions in CJD and Mad Cow Disease. Radiation and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are known to accelerate the misfolding of the protein, making it act like an infectious thing that spreads from cell to cell. In Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, similar folding of proteins causes the symptoms. The factors causing that misfolding are environmental dietary factors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Weren't you saying that even in the test tube, when they add omega-6 oils to these proteins, it stimulates the misfolding?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's been done with prions in all the prion-related diseases. In Parkinson's disease, the protein is called alpha-synuclein. DHA—the long-chain, highly unsaturated fatty acid—is known to induce the misfolding, while saturated fatty acids can block the misfolding. The evidence links this to an aging process. With aging, the brain accumulates more and more DHA. Especially under the influence of estrogen, women accumulate more DHA and circulate more of it in the blood. Very typically, women are more susceptible than men to several of the degenerative inflammatory diseases.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** DHA is one of the omega oils they tout as being anti-inflammatory and good for women. But you're saying it actually works in conjunction with estrogen to be destructive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does several things. It breaks down and forms acrolein, which is a very reactive fragment that attaches to the tau protein involved in the filament formation in Alzheimer's disease. DHA activates the excitotoxic process; it increases the glutamate excitatory system, increasing free glutamic acid in the brain fluid. In all these brain degenerative diseases, you can see increased breakdown products of the fish oil type of polyunsaturated fats in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Everything from the short acrolein up to the larger prostaglandin-like breakdown products called isoprostanes or neuroprostanes show up increasingly with age and dementia.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So as a newborn infant, their brains have very little DHA and EPA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because their fats have been synthesized by their own bodies, mostly from glucose absorbed from the mother. The animal body can produce saturated fats, monounsaturated fats like oleic acid, and our own series called the omega-9 series. At birth, these are the dominant fats in the baby's brain.

Animal studies going back 30 or 40 years showed that if you feed pregnant animals a large amount of polyunsaturated fats, their babies are born with smaller brains and don't learn as well. A group in France two or three years ago fed pregnant women a high polyunsaturated fat diet, hoping to demonstrate increased learning in the fetus. They found that learning was retarded in the presence of the omega-3 fatty diet to the mother, just in line with the animal studies.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did they think these oils were useful because they did autopsies on adults and found the brains had a lot of these oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. They said, "Your brain is full of fish oil, so it must be good for the brain." But looking at a baby's brain, it doesn't have any. The more demented and old brains have more than young brains.

## Caller: Diabetes and Epigenetics

**Caller:** I've seen several doctors and never had one ask me what I eat, yet they give me weird looks when I tell them both my grandfathers died from type 2 diabetes. It seems like I'm destined to get it. I had an argument with a professor who said there was evidence for genetics based on twins separated at birth. How much of that is actually genetic versus the shared intrauterine environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is an argument I've been making for a long time. There was a genetically oriented argument that working-class people would never rise to the middle class because of genetic influence on intelligence. I pointed out the evidence of the intrauterine environment and nutrition. The evidence from animal studies is clear: twins have a very similar environment and get the same nutrition. If the mother's health changes from pregnancy to pregnancy, the intelligence of the baby is influenced by what she was eating.

Animal studies show this effect can be passed on for four generations. Studies of people starved during pregnancy in Holland and Russia showed that not only were their babies impaired mentally, but even their grandchildren showed impairment. It is inherited, but it is a physiological, environmental thing. If they had a super-supportive environment, that could be corrected and wouldn't be passed on.

**Caller:** Would the mother's nutrition during gestation explain the variance in how people tolerate a poor diet? Some people suffer more than others. Is that because of hormonal reserves from their mother's diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 30 or 40 years ago, doctors talked about the "thrifty gene" that caused some families to get fat on very little food. That is undoubtedly another example of inheritance by gestational influence. If you are starving, the fetus adjusts to a poor diet and becomes thrifty. They've never identified a thrifty gene or a gene for diabetes.

When the country of Israel was formed, immigrants came from Africa and Europe. The Europeans had a high rate of diabetes, but the immigrants from poor countries had almost no diabetes. After a second generation of living on a relatively abundant European style of eating, the immigrants' children were developing diabetes at the same rate as the Europeans. This totally destroys the idea of genetic diabetes.

## Caller: Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosis

**Caller:** I've been told I have cystic fibrosis and tested positive on the chloride sweat test. I've been told this is a malfunction in a sodium transport mechanism. Can you shed any light on this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've suspected that hypothyroidism is sometimes misunderstood and a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is made. When I worked in the woods, we had a cook who believed that if you sweated a lot, you needed salt replacement. He put a tablespoon of salt in everyone's breakfast. Within a few days, I was tending to faint if I didn't take salt pills, and my skin was so salty I got crystals of salt on my forehead. I would have been considered to have cystic fibrosis from the chloride coming out of my skin, but it was simply an adaptation to my thyroid metabolism and high salt intake.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you have any suggestions for someone with cystic fibrosis regarding environmental changes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They should examine their thyroid function very thoroughly, including measurements of carbon dioxide (bicarbonate) in the blood and exhaled carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is what actually regulates the movement of sodium and other minerals. If you look with a suspicion of hypothyroidism and endocrine involvement, I think you'll likely find the answer in that.

## Caller: Field Theory and Holistic Medicine

**Caller:** You mentioned field theory versus the concept of a gene. Integrating field theory back into our understanding would do a world of change—realizing your genetic code is more like a field frequency you can willfully affect. It's about integrating holistic medicine with diet and proper herbs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's a shame that field theory was the theory for the first 50 years of this century and didn't seem to carry on.

**Caller:** Science got a little confused. What needs to happen is an integration of the two. You can have a willful effect on it, but those things are also debilitated by your chemistry. If you aren't eating enough, your ability to emanate energy will be debilitated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is totally right on.

## Caller: Thyroid Supplements and Progesterone

**Caller:** You've mentioned that hypothyroidism can lead to a downward spiral of high estrogen, stress hormones, and low progesterone. You mentioned supplemental desiccated thyroid to get out of that cycle. Is that something that works in the short term, or would you have to continue for the rest of your life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen a few people who needed it just for a few days to break a stress cycle. But if your body is loaded with polyunsaturated fats, every time you get hungry, these come into your bloodstream and interfere with thyroid function. The average person who is hypothyroid at age 20 or 30 has a body so saturated with antithyroid agents that it takes a couple of years of strict diet before they can get along without thyroid.

**Caller:** Would the same thing go for low progesterone? Could a few doses get them out of that cycle?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is much more frequent than the quick response to thyroid. I've seen two or three hundred women who just needed one or a few doses of progesterone to get out of the cycle and get going on their own.

One woman, who since puberty had been very white-skinned with purple lips, put some progesterone on her hand. A little later she telephoned and said she felt something happening. When she got home, her cheeks were pink and her lips were red. Weeks later, her parents asked what happened to her color. It had existed for 18 years, and in just minutes, one dose of progesterone apparently permanently changed her physiology.

## Caller: Eugenics and Eye Health

**Caller:** I saw a report about a hospital in Sonoma where they sterilized kids whose parents were considered misfits. The report said Hitler used that as a model.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't heard of that particular hospital, but there were several doing that in the US in the 1920s. American geneticists were the model for Hitler's eugenics program. The American journal was called *Annals of Eugenics* until 1954, and another was *The Quarterly of Eugenics* until 1969. Public recognition of their role in Hitler's campaigns finally caused them to change their names.

**Caller:** My other question is about the upcoming eclipse. If someone injures their eyes, is it possible to regenerate vision with beta-carotene or vitamin K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the exposure has happened in the first hour, red light—like seeing light through your eyelids—can have a detoxifying effect on the heat damage. It stimulates circulation and lowers inflammation. Anti-inflammatory things like aspirin and vitamin E help to stop inflammation from such injury.

## Caller: Salt, Thyroid, and Nuts

**Caller:** Could you explain how salt affects the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It stimulates cells to use oxygen and works with thyroid to rev up the oxidation of sugar, producing carbon dioxide.

**Caller:** So if you had an overactive thyroid, would it be best not to eat salt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not necessarily. Your body should govern your salt appetite. You won't have a salt appetite if you aren't losing salt fast enough.

**Caller:** Are you saying it's not good to eat nuts like almonds and walnuts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. I think they are major problems [due to polyunsaturated fats].

## Caller: Lamarck vs. Darwin

**Caller:** You talked about bacteria inheriting resistance to antibiotics, which suggests inheriting acquired characteristics. Could you comment on how that impacts the work of Lamarck?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Charles Darwin was actually not an antagonist of Lamarck. Darwin's grandfather was a Lamarckian, and Darwin got his basic ideas from him. In the introduction to one of the editions of *The Descent of Man*, he made several points that he was not saying it's just a matter of random mutations. He pointed out several other mechanisms of inheritance.

The anti-Lamarckians were actually anti-evolutionists who didn't like the idea that organisms could have a purpose or respond reasonably to the environment in a way that could be passed on. Anti-Lamarckism was a creation of late 19th-century anti-evolutionists who became the basis for the neo-Darwinist movement, which suppressed the idea of a purposeful developmental field.

**Caller:** I'm thinking about this from reading Arthur Koestler's *The Case of the Midwife Toad*. So the suppression of Lamarck is dogmatic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, even to the point of being irrational and unscientific. It's like a cultish doctrine.

## Conclusion: Cellular Regeneration

**Andrew Murray:** Briefly, Dr. Peat, I read in your newsletter that Zajicek had done experiments revealing cell streaming in tissues normally thought of as static, specifically in the pancreas with insulin-secreting cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the pancreas, like other tissues, is constantly regenerating. It's just our bad, dangerous fats in the diet that are constantly killing off the insulin-secreting cells.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's possible to regain insulin-secreting cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The organism is in very vigorous replacement everywhere. All the parts are turning over in a very organized, meaningful way, doing its best to renew everything, including the things associated with diseases such as lack of insulin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And just to wrap up, these oils that Zajicek showed were harming the cells include every vegetable oil apart from olive oil, coconut oil, and animal fats such as butter and ruminant fat.
