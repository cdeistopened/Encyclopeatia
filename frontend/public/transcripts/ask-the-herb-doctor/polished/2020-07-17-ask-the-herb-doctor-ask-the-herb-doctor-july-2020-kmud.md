## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining us again. For those listening for the first time, would you outline your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I went to a teacher's college as an undergraduate and studied humanities, and then for a while went to Ohio State studying linguistics. I started an experimental school, spent a few years on that, and finally decided to go back to the university to get a PhD in biology from 1968 to 1972. Since then, I've been doing a mixture of humanities and biology.

## Linoleic Acid and Coronavirus Susceptibility

**Andrew Murray:** Before we get into the subjects surrounding the pandemic, let me ask you about a recent pre-publication which implicates linoleic acid—an omega-6 compound found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, meats, and eggs. I know you've always opposed all PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) as being detrimental to health and pro-inflammatory.

This article implies that linoleic acid is responsible for allowing the spike protein of the coronavirus to dock with the cell membrane, facilitating entry into the cell. This suggests that diets rich in linoleic acid—which have been pushed on populations for the last 40 years—may put patients at increased risk. What do you think about the paper?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It actually should be a revolutionary paper because it shows that linoleic acid is essential for forming the receptor binding site of the spike protein. The spike protein is the thing that makes this a more dangerous form of coronavirus than the common cold. If you can't form the crucial thing that makes it infective without linoleic acid, that has all kinds of ramifications.

It has been known for 80 years—in a human experiment overseen by George Burr, who originated the idea that these fats are essential—that a person on a diet with absolutely no measurable level of linoleic, linolenic, or arachidonic acid saw their chronic health problems, such as migraines and hypertension, disappear after about four months.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That didn't change their viewpoint on the essential fatty acids, did it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that was totally passed over. In 1929, very little was known about nutrition. When they added the polyunsaturated fats back in, the metabolic rate slowed tremendously. Burr himself demonstrated in 1932 or 1933 that he could suppress metabolism by about 50% when he added back the so-called essential fatty acids.

But all of that was passed over when the seed oil industry had to dispose of the fatty oils from soy. They had been used for making plastics, varnishes, and paints, but a new petroleum-based industry was coming in. They had to find a new market for their soy oil, so they revived the old 1929 study—which had been disproved—and said these are essential, so you should eat lots of them. It has convinced lots of people to eat polyunsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if a myth could be spread back then to convince everyone they needed these fatty acids, imagine what media and mass propaganda can do today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Animal experiments showed that a diet free of the essential fats prevented diabetes, cancer, inflammation from trauma, and sickness from poisoning. Resistance was vastly higher if they had been totally deprived of the unsaturated fats. Since those studies have been essentially suppressed because they hurt oil sales, it is assumed that everyone has to have linoleic acid on the surface of their cells. Since the doctrine says it has to be there, they won't be able to accept that it is the cause of much of the infection of coronavirus.

## The Mechanism of Infection and ACE2

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there is anything else other than a mechanistic lock-and-key? If linoleic acid is present in the cell membranes of people with high polyunsaturated diets, are they more susceptible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The existing doctrine is that this docking site is the ACE2 protein, part of the angiotensin system. The mechanism has been understood for almost 20 years: ACE2 is the anti-inflammatory enzyme that makes the pro-inflammatory angiotensin harmless. The virus sticks to and inactivates the ACE2 enzyme, removing our protection against inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** And you're saying this is more easily facilitated in people with a high linoleic acid diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's apparently essential for inactivating the protective ACE2 enzyme. Since estrogen decreases ACE2 and progesterone increases it, they have theorized that giving estrogen will prevent infections by eliminating ACE2—but that happens to be our protective enzyme. Estrogen has many overlaps with polyunsaturated fats; they increase estrogenicity, and estrogen increases their accumulation in the tissues. It is logical that both estrogen and polyunsaturated fats favor the damage done by the virus. Women who are cycling—basically anyone under 45 and female—are extremely protected against infection, despite having high levels of the ACE2 enzyme which supposedly would make them more infective.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who want the evidence, the paper is on the preprint server for biology, *bioRxiv*, titled "Unexpected Free Fatty Acid Binding Pockets in the Cryo-EM Structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein."

## Analyzing Mortality Statistics

**Andrew Murray:** There seems to be a media frenzy concerning a "second wave." The Worldometer data shows a rising graph of infections. Would you speak to the actual numbers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several people have asked me about the doubling of corona-diagnosed deaths in Texas and Florida in the last month. I looked at the actual numbers. In Florida, the number of people tested has gone from 50,000 to 70,000, while the number of diagnosed corona deaths has increased by exactly the same proportion—50%. If the deaths are rising in proportion to testing, really nothing is happening except media and government noise.

I also looked at the national figures published by the CDC. From January 1st to the end of March, there was a weird suppression of total deaths in the United States from all causes—accidents, old age, etc. There was a 10% or 15% decrease in all deaths. This continued until the pandemic was declared, and within a couple of days, there was a historically unprecedented peak of deaths called the COVID mortality spike. If you look at the missing part of the graph—the weird depression—the missing number of deaths amounts to the extra deaths piled up as soon as the pandemic was declared.

**Andrew Murray:** So the figures have been manipulated to allow this sudden spike on cue for the announcement of the pandemic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Anyone looking at the CDC statistics will see this historically unique mortality curve. It has always been a pyramid shape—steeply up and down. This year, the steep rise abruptly stops, becomes a flat depression, and then a super steep, unhistorical rise on the other side. It's obviously manipulated.

## Face Masks and Efficacy

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an interview with Professor Denis Rancourt, a PhD and former government official. He states that a 2020 study showed face masks had no significant influence on viral infectivity rates. If we imagine this as a staged event, face mask wearing seems to be a psychological control tool.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At first, they told people to stay inside. In England and Italy, police were making people stop working in their gardens. When they saw that worked fairly well, ordering the wearing of face masks was just another stage in obedience training. If they can make them stay indoors, maybe they can make them do just about anything with no scientific basis. 14 controlled studies found there was no protective effect from wearing a mask.

**Andrew Murray:** Professor Rancourt mentions that influenza is spread via aerosol. He said it's ridiculous to have a frenzy about washing hands and tables because that's not how influenza spreads. Being in a closed, confined space is how you catch it. He argues face masks don't seal the face well enough to prevent aerosol inhalation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mask wearing reminds me of the *Henny Penny* story. It seems most people didn't get the proper ending. In the original version, Henny Penny and all her friends are eaten by Foxy Loxy on the way to tell the king about the crisis. It's intended as a warning against falling for conspiracy panic ideas.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's interesting that the CDC federal guidelines say mask wearing is optional, yet states are mandating it.

## Caller: Masks and International Comparisons

**Caller (Speaker E):** I have family that are nurses, and they are all wearing masks. The few nurses that were infected had incidents where they didn't have proper masking. It seems like you're focusing on the conspiracy side. Countries that mandated masks have numbers that are super low. The US, Brazil, and India didn't have strict mask mandates and are being hit the hardest. Doesn't this contradict what you're saying? An N95 mask can reduce the spread. I'm worried KMUD is broadcasting that people don't need masks, which might kill people.

**Andrew Murray:** Let me clarify where this information is coming from. Professor Denis Rancourt states categorically that there is no scientific data supporting the use of face masks to decrease transmissibility significantly. He notes that unless you are wearing a full respirator that seals the face, aerosols are inhaled through the gaps. He also argues they can do more harm than good due to contamination when people touch them constantly.

**Caller (Speaker E):** Then how do you explain hospitals where people in COVID wards wear masks and don't get infected? Broadcasting this could contribute to mass death. Sweden didn't use masks and their cases went up. Countries with strict mandates had success.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can make a similar argument about anything you want people to do—destroy the world economy without any scientific basis, just as a precaution. Regarding international comparisons, that's about as far as you can get from a scientific controlled study. Those countries have an infinite number of different reasons for people getting sick.

## Caller: Protecting Others vs. Self

**Caller (Speaker F):** My understanding is that we are encouraged to wear masks to protect *other* people. The previous caller said people without masks were getting the virus more. If we are wearing them to protect others, why are the unmasked people getting sick?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, with any mask, you are breathing particles out the sides and breathing air in from the sides unless you wear a full respirator. The studies show masks are ineffective at preventing viral droplets in the air from infecting people with the flu.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For dentists and surgeons operating on open wounds, it is reasonable to wear a mask to prevent blowing droplets of saliva into the wound. That has been practiced for decades. But that is different from viral protection.

## Caller: Mortality Rates in Asia

**Caller (Speaker G):** I would like a detailed answer as to why the numbers are so low in Hong Kong and Korea.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Let's look at deaths per million population. Sweden, which had no lockdown, has 556. The UK has 666. The USA has 429. South Korea was 267.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So much of it depends on diagnosis. In Florida and Texas, if they use a test 100 times more frequently, they are going to diagnose more people as dying of COVID, regardless of the actual cause of death. For example, someone dying of liver cancer who tests positive gets written up as a COVID death. Every winter you see a sharp increase in mortality in northern countries, and the coronavirus hasn't changed that all-cause mortality whatsoever.

**Caller (Speaker G):** Earlier you talked about the protective value of progesterone. I thought more men were dying from this than women?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, men are more susceptible. Part of that is because women have protective exposure from progesterone, which is anti-inflammatory. Men don't express progesterone in the same way.

**Caller (Speaker G):** But post-menopausal women would not have that protection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mortality increases sharply after menopause. After the age of 80, women die more frequently than men.

## Caller: The AIDS Analogy

**Caller (Katie):** I want to relay a story about a friend during the AIDS epidemic. Dr. Fauci told people to stop bad behaviors, and my friend refused and ended up being a carrier who infected others. I don't think this is to be trifled with. Wearing masks is a compassionate act. Also, are you guys Trump supporters?

**Andrew Murray:** I'm going to decline to answer questions that politically implicate me. I am a constitutionalist or libertarian who believes in free speech and uncovering deception.

**Caller (Katie):** I agree there is deception, but I don't want to be "Typhoid Mary."

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Katie. We have to wrap up. Dr. Peat's website is RayPeat.com for fully referenced articles. We are always looking for the truth and objectively challenging the narrative. As the saying goes, those who give up liberty for security will end up with neither. Let's not give up our freedoms. Thank you and goodnight.
