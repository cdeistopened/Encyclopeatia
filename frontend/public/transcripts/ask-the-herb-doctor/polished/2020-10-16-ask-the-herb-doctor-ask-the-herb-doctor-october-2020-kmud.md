## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. It's October 16, 2020. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never heard the show before, we are both licensed medical herbalists who see people with various health conditions and advise dietary and nutritional supplement intake as a way forward for good health. We do this monthly radio show as a scientific endeavor to bring facts to the situation, to explore new alternatives, and to present discussions with references.

I see a concerted effort by fact-checkers against the "conspiracists" that are supposedly wrecking everything, but let's keep that aside. This is not a political show. We want to get to the truth and encourage people to find information, read it for themselves, and do their own fact-checking. As responsible citizens of this republic, we are charged with being vigilant and not submitting to authority unquestioningly.

We are very pleased to be joined by Dr. Peat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for giving your time again. For those who haven't heard you before, could you describe your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, I was in the humanities, teaching English, painting, and literature. Then I went back to graduate school from 1968 to 1972 at the University of Oregon to study biology, especially physiology and reproductive aging. Since then, I've been studying everything related to those subjects.

## The Great Barrington Declaration and Lockdowns

**Andrew Murray:** I want to discuss the concept of authoritarianism in medicine. Recently, a World Health Organization official stated that lockdown orders need to be lifted and are injurious to the population. I also received the Great Barrington Declaration, signed by three professors: Sunetra Gupta (Oxford), Martin Kulldorff (Harvard), and Jay Bhattacharya (Stanford). They declared that the cure—the lockdown—has been worse than the disease. They argue for protecting the elderly and high-risk groups, noting a thousand-fold difference in mortality risk. What do you know about this declaration? Do you think it could be a game-changer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been several signs that the general situation is changing. In England, people in the WHO and the CDC have acknowledged that the reporting of COVID deaths is probably overestimated. These three people at the Great Barrington Declaration point out that the true numbers are probably around 25,000 to 30,000 deaths in the season—much lower than ordinary flu deaths per year.

The fact that government officials are now qualifying their earlier statements shows they see the danger in trying to continue the fraud at the same high level. There are groups of lawyers, such as Tom Renz in Ohio, suing the governor to show the evidence used for imposing restrictions. He is presenting evidence of fraudulent activity, and the courts are accepting it.

**Andrew Murray:** If this was a truly fatal disease where people were dying across the board, the mandates might be justified. But that isn't what we are seeing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of their justifications was that the hospital system would be overloaded. In actuality, hundreds of hospitals are in danger of bankruptcy. In the first half of the year, 42 had already closed. They were so empty that they weren't making enough money to stay in business. So, the claim about overloading the system to demand a lockdown was a fraud.

**Andrew Murray:** Didn't New York Governor Cuomo drive that narrative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Governor Cuomo is using the situation to get rid of public expenses on schools. He asks, "Who needs all of these buildings? They can do it on computers." He immediately drew on Eric Schmidt as a guide to changing the education, health, and economic systems of the state, in line with projections made more than a year before the pandemic. They projected that a coronavirus pandemic could be used as an excuse for destroying the old economy and turning it into an extremely lucrative online substitute.

## Mortality Rates and Protecting the Vulnerable

**Andrew Murray:** The Great Barrington Declaration argues that the elderly and immune-compromised are at greater risk, similar to influenza, and that we should focus on protecting them. Is isolating the elderly common sense?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, for sure. Simply protecting the vulnerable people is something that has always been done.

**Andrew Murray:** There is nothing conspiratorial about that. Regarding the legal challenges, if we don't hear more about this, I would be worried. The law seems to be the next place where this can be played out.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The three professors from the Declaration were taken off some public websites and denounced. Fauci, for example, said it was nonsense. But they were saying these are scientifically determinable questions that should be discussed. Science isn't declared from headquarters; it is determined by examining evidence.

**Andrew Murray:** This is worldwide, too.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They are looking at natural immunity throughout history. The human race got here without vaccination. Something kept us alive other than vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, within hours of the Declaration becoming public—and news that they had been interviewed by officials in the White House—there was a huge publicity campaign denouncing them. Some experts even denied the existence of natural immunity, implying everyone would be dead without vaccinations. That shows how crazy they can get at the top.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Was Fauci trying to say there's no natural immunity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, he just said the Declaration was nonsense.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did they announce who the health officials at the White House were?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the head of Health and Human Services and Trump's personal health expert, Dr. Scott Atlas, a brain imaging specialist. The opposition asked, "What does he know?" because he isn't a virologist. Even though the three people who made the Declaration were epidemiology professors, the opposition claimed it wasn't the "right kind" of epidemiology.

## Herbs for Respiratory Health

**Andrew Murray:** If this is a regular pneumonia that can become a serious cytokine storm in a small subset of the population, there are many herbs used for pneumonia. Baikal skullcap contains baicalin, which has been shown to calm cytokine storms effectively. Wild indigo root and pleurisy root are also well-indicated for pneumonias. Echinacea and elderberry have value as antivirals. Licorice root, ginseng, and astragalus are also supportive.

I want to ask about Ephedra. Before it was banned in the States, we used it for asthma with good results as a bronchodilator. I know it's a sympathetic stimulant and was abused for weight loss, but what do you know about Ephedra?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I learned about it from my grandmother when I was about four. I was having migraine-like symptoms, and she made Ephedra tea. It gave me relief. It wasn't a cure, but it stopped the nausea and was very welcome.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there is merit behind it as a bronchodilator for inflammatory lung processes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once, when I was having an asthma attack, I tried a popular over-the-counter antihistamine. It made me sleepy but didn't relieve the bronchial constriction. Ephedra is very effective. It doesn't make you sleepy while unable to breathe; it makes you wakeful, but it relaxes and reduces the inflammation in the bronchial tubes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you have a cold with a runny nose and fever, and then get chest tightness, that is your immune system being inflamed. Many herbs used for thousands of years to treat flu are anti-inflammatory. Regarding Ephedra, it is great for acute situations, but I don't think any of us would recommend it for long-term use because it stimulates adrenaline.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One other perspective on flu-like symptoms: In experiments with dogs around the 1920s, Walter Alvarez found that the first inflammation caused by flu-like viruses occurred in the intestine. All symptoms peaked while the intestine was infected, even with no viruses in the respiratory system yet. Inflammation of the bowel releases serotonin and histamine that cause systemic inflammation, edema of the lungs, and deranged vasoconstriction. The deadly symptoms we see with COVID and influenza are made worse by intestinal signals.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why we always recommend people use Cascara when they get a cold or flu. Clean your intestines out.

## Caller: Sensitivity to Stimuli

**Caller:** I'm from the East Coast. I'm curious about how different people interpret the same stimuli. I notice smells or substances that I don't react well to, but other people don't notice them at all. Are those people handling it better, or are they like a frog in boiling water—being harmed but unable to tell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Excitation from something like Ephedra can either push your system into an anti-inflammatory condition or exhaust it and exacerbate the problem. My orientation comes from Pavlov's work in the 1920s. He found that "strong-minded" dogs—those with strong personalities that didn't experience stress easily—had high sensory thresholds. Their hearing was less acute than the unstable animals.

Castration would make one of these strong, stable animals sensitive because it lowered their cellular energy. Conversely, removing the ovaries of anxious, oversensitive females would strengthen their personality and make them resist stress. He demonstrated that androgens generally keep up cellular energy, while estrogen pushes energy down and increases excitability. For example, a pregnant or nursing woman becomes very sensitive to smells or sounds. Progesterone is the healthy female's balancing factor for estrogen, whereas in the male, androgens are the main stabilizing factors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, the people who don't notice the smell likely have a more stabilizing hormonal profile?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the average situation, I think that's so.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But if you are breathing VOCs off paint, just because people can't smell it doesn't mean it's not hurting them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct.

## Caller: PCR Tests and Vaccine Rush

**Caller:** I have two questions. First, could you give me information on the PCR test for COVID-19? Second, what is your opinion on the mad global rush to develop a COVID-19 vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding the vaccine, it's obviously pushed by the pharmaceutical industry. There is a military-dominated secret organization in charge of issuing contracts worth billions of dollars to the pharmaceutical industry. It is not open to the public; it is specifically closed, like a military project.

Regarding the PCR test: It will identify a single strand of nucleic acid if you start with the right evidence. Any fragment of the virus's RNA is multiplied. Normally, they only put it through 35 cycles of amplification, but some current tests are going to 45 cycles. This gives an unrealistic idea; a single molecule could look like a haystack. It can detect the presence of something regardless of whether it's harmful.

There are now rapid antigen tests that use traditional antigens associated with the virus and a chemical indicator. In 15 minutes, they can show the presence of antigens in a reasonable amount, indicating an actual degree of infection, whereas the PCR test doesn't show any realistic quantity.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the antigen test is much more accurate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The PCR isn't "inaccurate," but it is unrealistic because it can't distinguish between one molecule and a trillion molecules.

**Andrew Murray:** And regarding the rush to develop a vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a secretive process dominated by the pharmaceutical industry. It ignores the fact that since the 1970s, CDC experts have realized it is impossible to make an effective influenza vaccine. There is no evidence that a coronavirus vaccine can be made any easier than an influenza vaccine.

## Lab Origins and Gain of Function

**Andrew Murray:** I want to bring up Li-Meng Yan, a PhD virologist and whistleblower. She was interviewed by Tucker Carlson, stating that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured in a lab. She has released a second paper titled *SARS-CoV-2 Is an Unrestricted Bioweapon*. She provides proof that this is a manufactured organism. Of course, she has been fact-checked immediately. Dr. Peat, what are your views on this being a lab-created virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Leading journals, including *The Lancet* and *Nature*, were discussing gain-of-function research as far back as 2015. They were researching how to make animal viruses infective and virulent in humans. They cite research by Ralph Baric's virology lab at the University of North Carolina. The particular coronavirus adapted to attack the ACE2 enzyme in humans was designed in Ralph Baric's lab. This led to a moratorium on such research. Fauci violated that moratorium and took the research information to Wuhan, where the moratorium couldn't be enforced. So, Fauci and Ralph Baric are really close to the core of the problem.

**Andrew Murray:** It is hard to imagine a greater worldwide conspiracy, but science seeks the truth. The Ohio lawyer I mentioned noted that CDC documents state they need to support high levels of fear and anxiety to support compliance.

Regarding flu vaccines, I've met people who get sick immediately after taking them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A large series of good studies found that the year after an influenza vaccination, the chance of getting a coronavirus infection is greatly increased. Yet, many college presidents are requiring incoming students to get a flu vaccination, contrary to the existing research.
