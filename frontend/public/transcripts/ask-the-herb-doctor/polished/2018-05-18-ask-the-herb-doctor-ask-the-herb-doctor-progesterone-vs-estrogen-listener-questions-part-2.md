## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. This month’s topic is a roundup of where we left off in March discussing progesterone and estrogen. I want to dissect that a little more with facts and arguments refuting the "facts" about how positive estrogen is and how negative progesterone is.

I want to discuss a paper written by Inger Sundström Poromaa at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, apparently a leading expert on brain metabolism and sex hormones. I mentioned in March that the PROTECT and SYNAPSE trials—regarding progesterone's anti-inflammatory effects in traumatic brain injury—were published and apparently relatively unsuccessful. However, Dr. Donald Stein, a PhD brain injury expert at Emory University, was part of the team publishing in the *Journal of Neurotrauma*. He outlined obvious mistakes in the studies, stating the criteria used did not produce valid results. He strongly opposed findings showing no benefit for progesterone, citing evidence to the contrary.

To discuss the ongoing lies about how positive estrogen is and how dangerous progesterone is, we have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat has been a big advocate of things like thyroid, sugar, and progesterone. Mainstream medicine would argue sugar or pregnenolone are not good for you, despite evidence to the contrary. This is clear in the trials regarding Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Women with estrogen dominance are advised to take estrogen for bone health or hot flashes, which is likely the last thing they need.

Dr. Peat, given your PhD was in reproductive hormones, could you outline your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology, I was a literature, linguistics, and art major. I decided to study biology to understand how language, intelligence, and consciousness work. I found that brain biology—so-called cognitive science—was pure dogmatism with very little science.

I shifted to reproductive physiology to study how the organism works from the germ cell to the brain. Brain science is not distinct from reproductive physiology; the brain is the motor for the whole life process. I did my dissertation in 1972 on the oxidative changes in the uterus as it changes with aging.

## Estrogen, Epilepsy, and Energy Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** Let’s jump into questions left over from March. Regarding catamenial epilepsy and estrogens like estrone, estriol, and estradiol—how do you understand the triggering of epilepsy in susceptible females? It is estrogen-related, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In my research, I looked through physiology regarding the brain and uterus up until 1970. I couldn't find evidence distinguishing the physiology of estrogen stimulation from X-ray stimulation, oxygen deprivation, or vitamin E deficiency. All of those things deplete the energy production of the cell, which is based on oxidation.

When the brain is oversupplied with estrogen or lacks its antagonist, progesterone, the whole system wastes oxygen. It is unable to keep the energy level up to the point where cells are stable. A high-energy state is when a cell is ready to work, but not acting. When forced to work more than it is ready for, the energy level falls, and it enters a constantly active state trying to restore energy.

Hypoglycemia works the same as a lack of oxygen. Estrogen interferes with the supply of glucose to cells. It activates insulin but also activates the release of fatty acids, which block the ability to oxidize glucose. Estrogen activates cells by increasing the function of glutamic acid (glutamate), a brain excitant. By increasing glutamate, it decreases GABA, the inhibiting signal. So, estrogen excites brain cells while interfering with their use of oxygen and glucose.

**Andrew Murray:** So the estrogens really mimic a stress response.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I consider estrogen's function to be "controlled stress." The organism requires a constant supply of energy for development. If that energy supply becomes fatally impaired, the function of estrogen is to erase the developmental program and revert to the single, multiplying cell. Without interference, estrogen tends to produce the cancer cell, but it also activates the production of the egg. Its proper function should be once a month, for a few hours, to activate potential new life.

Catamenial epilepsy tends to begin around age nine, when estrogen is rising but progesterone hasn't risen yet. Brain metabolism slows down at puberty, the body takes it as a threat to survival, and turns on the reproductive process.

**Andrew Murray:** Is it correct that the only real benefit for estrogen is the inflammation it promotes to stimulate implantation of an egg?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Throughout the organism, whenever tissue is stressed, it tends to turn on the local production of estrogen. That is how it leads to cancer; every cell essentially has the apparatus for making estrogen.

After menopause, when progesterone production becomes limited, the body's tissues—breast, uterus, brain, liver, skin, fat, muscle—begin producing estrogen. This is the opposite of what menopause doctors teach. However, it can't escape the cell because it also increases the estrogen-binding protein (the receptor). Intracellular estrogen increases, but it doesn't get into the blood. You measure the blood and it looks like you're estrogen deficient, when you are actually being systemically poisoned with intracellular estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** You’ve mentioned before that estrogen is responsible for edema and cell swelling.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The individual cell swells up when it is excited and de-energized. When you get the energy back up, it squeezes the water out. That same swollen state occurs in capillaries and blood vessels; they become leaky. Water goes into the tissues and out of the bloodstream. This is involved in the circulatory problems of pregnancy. The blood volume shrinks, and the kidneys send signals to raise blood pressure to try to get more circulation.

**Andrew Murray:** In hypothyroidism, the cell remains in a constantly stressed state where it's not able to relax.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You see the same process in the heart muscle. Estrogen weakens the contraction but makes it more frequent. A great excess of estrogen causes a shock-like state of the heart—rapid but very weak pulsation. Progesterone strengthens it, letting cells build up energy so when it does contract, it is a powerful, efficient pump.

## Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Naltrexone

**Shauna (Caller):** Regarding Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), what is the underlying condition? Is it hypometabolism? Also, is Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) effective for CFS?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One way of thinking of CFS is that it is very similar to the seizure state in the brain, or the failure state in the heart, under the influence of low progesterone and excess estrogen. It is a deficiency of energy where the cell goes into that swollen, over-excitable state.

When a cell is in very bad condition, it can produce histamine. In the hypothyroid, low-progesterone chronic state, the body tends to locally produce a lot of histamine and other inflammatory substances.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about Low Dose Naltrexone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have experience using Naloxone more than Naltrexone, but they are essentially identical. I found that 1 to 4 milligrams per day of Naloxone would break a depressed condition by suppressing the endorphins, which are induced by lactic acid and fatigue. Endorphins are an emergency measure to turn off excitation. Some people use even a hundredth of a milligram and find a therapeutic effect. I consider 4 milligrams a fairly large dose.

## B-Vitamins: Dosage and Safety

**Caller:** I have a question about B-complex vitamins. I understand B1, B2, and B3 are beneficial. But I read that B5 (pantothenic acid), B4 (adenine), folic acid, and B12 might not be good to take. Should they be taken separately or in specific ratios?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Their main metabolic similarity is that they are regulators and facilitators of cell oxidative energy processes. Pantothenic acid (B5) is somewhat off the main group, but essential. It is anti-stress and helps regulate blood sugar and allergies. Sometimes a 400 to 500 mg dose of pantothenic acid can relieve stress symptoms. It is unusual because it doesn't affect the interactions of the others. In monkeys, they fed them a cup a day of pure pantothenic acid with no side effects.

**Caller:** So pantothenic acid can be taken daily up to 400mg?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Caller:** What about the others?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The orthomolecular movement encouraged overdose. You can get therapeutic results with 5 or 10 times the minimum daily requirement (e.g., 10-20 mg of B1, B2, B6). I think it's good to try the smallest dose, maybe five times the minimum requirement.

**Caller:** What about B3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is important to get the **niacinamide** form. Niacin releases inflammatory mediators. Niacinamide is safe up to at least a couple hundred milligrams. I've seen people with terminal brain diseases cure themselves taking just 150 or 200 mg of niacinamide per day.

**Caller:** What about Biotin (B7)? I hear it regulates glucose, but is there a negative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen good results from big doses, but 50 years ago animal studies showed moderate overdose could cause liver cancer. I've always been leery about it. I would stick to around 1 milligram of biotin per day.

**Caller:** And folic acid? I read you think it's dangerous.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's safe at a dose of around 1 mg, maybe as high as 5 mg. However, you have to be cautious with Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) and folic acid. Something in the synthetic process makes a lot of people get migraine headaches, hemorrhoids, and bowel inflammation from them. They are yellow molecules, and I think their sensitivity to light and oxidation makes the pure chemical allergenic for many people.

**Caller:** And B12?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you eat animal products, and because intestinal bacteria make a lot of it, you usually have enough. I hear from people with small intestine inflammation (SIBO) who have B12 levels 50% higher than normal because their bacteria are thriving where they shouldn't be.

## Critiquing the Swedish Study: Serotonin and Depression

**Andrew Murray:** I want to go over the article by Professor Inger Sundström Poromaa regarding progesterone. She claims progesterone causes PMS and depression. She writes that estrogen increases brain serotonin, "the hormone most associated with happiness," while progesterone can have a depressing effect. Dr. Peat, what do you think about the claim that serotonin is a happiness signal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To be polite, I think it's very, very silly. Everything there is confused and backwards. Serotonin is essential for inflammation, osteoporosis, cancer, blood clotting, and spasms. It is right there with histamine as the most intense, acute local inflammatory signal.

In the brain, the inflammatory process of serotonin turns on the whole stress system that activates ACTH and cortisol. Estrogen activates that serotonin-dependent pathway and directly activates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Estrogen is a basic stress hormone. Serotonin is a terminal mediator of that stress process.

**Andrew Murray:** She also cites research by Torbjörn Bäckström claiming progesterone metabolites (like allopregnanolone) bind to the GABA-A receptor and cause "the blues," similar to alcohol or sleeping pills.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is an interesting confusion of the meaning of "depression." In the heart, progesterone *depresses* the spastic activity that leads to cardiac arrest and facilitates a good rhythm. Estrogen has the opposite effect; it tends to produce arrhythmia.

## Menarche, Pregnancy, and Aging

**Andrew Murray:** The article suggests progesterone's negative effects are due to modern women having more periods than in the past. She claims 300 years ago women started menstruating at 17 or 18 because they were less healthy. But you’ve said early menarche is actually detrimental.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The age at menarche is getting lower, and that corresponds to estrogen problems later in life. Recent studies relate early puberty to higher estrogen levels in the uterus during gestation and a tendency to have autistic babies.

**Andrew Murray:** She also claims that historically, women were pregnant or breastfeeding constantly, implying they weren't subjected to progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** She seems to get it exactly wrong. Pregnancy is not a time of low progesterone. A normal cycling woman produces maybe 30 mg a day. The placenta in a term pregnancy weighs about a pound and a half—100 times bigger than the ovaries—and produces at least 30 times as much progesterone per day.

There is a book, *Hypothalamus, Pituitary and Aging* by A.V. Everitt, describing experiments where rabbits were mated constantly. The multi-litter rabbits had much more flexible, young connective tissue and lived longer than non-mated animals. It was the high, constant exposure to progesterone reversing estrogen-induced aging.

## Aspirin, Melanoma, and Hydrogen Water

**Mike (Caller):** Have you reviewed the recent study from Northwestern University about a correlation between daily aspirin and melanoma risk in men?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw that. I don't know what happened there, considering all other cancers studied show that aspirin prevents them.

**Andrew Murray:** It’s likely similar to the progesterone studies where the methodology is in question.

**Mike (Caller):** What are your thoughts on molecular hydrogen water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything I've seen looks like it reduces free radical oxidative damage and lowers inflammation.

## Carbon Dioxide Baths

**Caller (Long Island):** Regarding CO2 therapy, can you put it in a bathtub? Since it's heavier than air, will it stay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you get in and out slowly, it doesn't slosh out much. You can check the level with a match; the flame goes out as soon as you sink it into the pure CO2. A 1908 article described a weekly CO2 bath as equivalent to a vacation at the ocean.

**Caller:** Does it lower your temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has a warm sensation when it touches your skin because it opens up blood vessels. However, you could chill yourself if you did it in a cold room because you lose heat faster through the skin. I use CO2 from a welding shop.

## CoQ10, Vitamin K2, and Progesterone Dosage

**Caller:** What can you tell me about MitoQ?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's a new variant of CoQ10. I haven't studied it much.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there is merit to using CoQ10?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in many cases a person is not producing enough. Vitamin K works with CoQ10 and makes it more effective and stable.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding Vitamin K2 dosage, Thorne Research has a liquid K2 (1mg per drop). What do you think about K2 use with aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Japanese have experimented with higher levels, up to 45 mg per day. I knew a person with persistently high blood pressure (240/140) due to calcified vessels. He took 40 or 50 mg per day of Vitamin K, and within two weeks his pressure was essentially normal (140/70).

**Andrew Murray:** What is a general progesterone dose for a female?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If taking it orally in an oil-dissolved form, 20 or 30 mg is a very effective dose. I've used as much as 100 mg myself for a migraine; it knocked it out in two minutes.

**Andrew Murray:** And the "depressing" effect is actually sedative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is a powerful sedative. 100 mg put me to sleep for a couple of hours.

## Earthing and the Amygdala

**Peter (Caller):** What is the mechanism behind "earthing" or walking barefoot on the beach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Negative ionized air is abundant near the ocean. Also, freeing your feet from shoes is a powerful stimulus. The immune system reacts to electrically charged things in the environment. The earth is always a source of electrons relative to the higher atmosphere.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wanted to comment on one bad thing about that Swedish paper. She discussed amygdala activation as a negative fear thing. The amygdala regulates affection and love, not just anxiety and fear.

## Migraine Triggers and Treatments

**Naomi (Caller):** You mentioned things that cause migraines and things that alleviate them. I missed the list.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Riboflavin (B2) and folic acid are the ones that are most irritating. Getting the intestine free of irritants is important. Fibrous food such as raw carrot or cooked mushrooms helps clean out inflammatory substances. Sugar helps stop the production of histamine and serotonin.

**Naomi (Caller):** I have a B-complex. Should I avoid it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If I took one, I would have a migraine for about three days.

**Naomi (Caller):** And what alleviates it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone, sugar, and bowel-stimulating foods.

## PQQ and Adenosine

**Caller:** Is PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone) helpful for mitochondria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard about it but never studied it.

**Caller:** What about Adenine or Vitamin B4 (Adenosine)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Adenosine is risky. It is the opposite of caffeine in some ways and can bring on symptoms that caffeine alleviates, like an asthma attack. I wouldn't risk using it.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. For listeners, Dr. Peat can be found at `raypeat.com`. Thanks for joining us.
