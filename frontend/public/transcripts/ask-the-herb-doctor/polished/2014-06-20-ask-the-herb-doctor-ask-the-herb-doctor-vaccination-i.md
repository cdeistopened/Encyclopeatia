## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who have never listened to the shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

This month's subject has come around fortuitously in terms of the recent press on the whooping cough outbreaks that have been occurring in California and in different states across the US. I wanted to do the show on vaccinations. I know there are many different opinions out there about how useful they are, how harmful they could potentially be, and the debate regarding autism and the MMR vaccination is still raging.

This evening, we are pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. For those who have never heard Dr. Peat speak, he provides an opinion from a broad scientific background showing that things are not always as they seem. Even though diseases have raged through humanity since the beginning of time, various changes in our world have made it a harder place to live in terms of exposure to toxins. We are exposed to environmental estrogens, radiation, and dietary factors that have degraded the energy with which human beings fight infection.

As an organism, we have an innate store of energy. Slowly but surely, from infancy to adulthood, our exposure to various things interferes with our bodily systems. The immune system is a complex and finely tuned weapon against infection. Infection has always been present; we coexist with a wide range of organisms, some of which are pathogenic.

Some diseases have had wide media attention, like polio. I remember growing up and seeing pictures of polio victims from 15 or 20 years prior—children wearing braces and calipers. Diseases with severe outcomes like polio struck the population, and modern science took full steam ahead with pharmaceuticals. The campaign to eradicate polio, like smallpox, became a major effort of government and industry.

However, it is a strange concept that a government-sanctioned process can be outside of the law. In medicine, the Hippocratic oath states: "First, do no harm." Yet, vaccine products have been indemnified by the government. If people are damaged by vaccines, the manufacturing company cannot be taken to court. The United States legal standard defines vaccines as "unavoidably unsafe products," meaning they are incapable of being made safe for their intended use because they contain chemicals and elements poisonous to the body.

As we talk to Dr. Peat, keep in mind that the media and corporations often present a one-sided story. Dr. Peat may seem controversial, but his statements are the product of investigative work and scientific review.

## The Evolution of Immune Theory

**Andrew Murray:** Hi, Dr. Peat. Thanks for joining us. I’ve given the outline of the show, but I’d like to give you the opportunity to share your scientific background before we begin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Although I concentrated on physiology, reproductive aging, and biochemistry during my four years at the University of Oregon, I took a seminar on developmental biology in 1969. The professor was sponsoring an international conference on immunology, so I got to hear the latest research explaining the clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity.

The most memorable thing about the conference was a professor describing his *in vitro* experiments with white blood cells. He showed that even after being clonally deleted, when the concentration was proper, they could reconstitute themselves as if each cell had knowledge of the whole organism. This contradicted the mechanistic assumptions of the clonal selection theory. However, it corresponds closely to what is now seen as epigenetic expression, where each cell knows where it belongs in the whole organism.

The clonal selection theory was developed to justify vaccination practice. Vaccination began as an entirely empirical practice—trial and error—before people even knew cells existed. Early in the 20th century, Paul Ehrlich developed the approach that led to the clonal selection theory, which remains dominant. However, in the last few years, there has been a recognition that the innate immune system—which we share with primitive animals and plants—is involved in the adaptive immune system.

In the same year Paul Ehrlich received his Nobel Prize, Élie Metchnikoff also shared it. Metchnikoff presented information about the innate immune system, viewing immunity as a developmental process of maintaining the integrity of the organism. His work was largely ignored until recently.

In 1969, my professors were uninterested in innate immunity. But I had been reading William F. Koch, who developed evidence early in the century that oxidative cell metabolism is responsible for innate resistance. This was the biochemical explanation for Metchnikoff’s developmental view. Koch showed that the energy of cells—oxidative metabolism—made innate immunity work. He was disparaged because his theory involved free radical reactions breaking down viruses and toxins, and biologists didn't acknowledge free radical chemistry until the 1950s. It is only now coming into scientific awareness that the innate immune system and metabolic processes determine why some people get diseases and others don't.

## Sanitation vs. Vaccination

**Andrew Murray:** Even currently, there are populations that don't come down with a disease during a raging epidemic. These are unvaccinated people who have their own innate defense.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People writing about the economics of immunity often refer to vaccination as the "economically viable" method. They acknowledge that sanitation and nutrition prevent disease, but they argue it is cheaper to vaccinate.

Around 1970, the World Health Organization did an experiment in Central America. They gave one village a medical team with vaccinations and regular medicine. In a second village, they did nothing. In a third village, they provided no medical help but supplied clean water and nutritional supplements to pregnant women and young children. After several years, the health was best in the nutrition and clean water village. The health in the medicalized and vaccinated village was actually worse. Scientifically, this suggests that while it might not be "economically viable" to clean up the environment, it is definitely better than vaccination for improving health.

**Andrew Murray:** I find it staggering that the industry producing vaccinations is completely outside of the law regarding litigation for damages.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I find that incredible, and there is very little talk about the actual damage. However, even in medical literature, which is biased against criticizing vaccines, you see evidence that vaccinated people have serious health problems. These range from baldness, sterility, and ovarian failure to psoriasis and autoimmune skin diseases. Long-range studies suggest a significant increase among vaccinated people of serious degenerative diseases with an autoimmune factor, such as dementia, cancer, and heart disease.

## Historical Immunity and PUFA

**Andrew Murray:** How do you think our immunity has changed from antiquity to now? We know Egyptians had some diseases, but how has the strength of immunity changed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Current experiments show that diet, sanitation, light exposure, and avoidance of pollution make a tremendous difference. In pre-industrial society, there was much less heavy metal exposure. I believe seed oils—polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)—have been a major contributor to bad health, along with heavy metals. These two interact to destroy our innate immune system.

Experiments preventing animals from consuming the usual polyunsaturated fats show they become extremely resistant to all kinds of injury, including infections. Interestingly, organs like kidneys can be transplanted from an animal deprived of polyunsaturated fats into another animal as if they were genetically related. The antigenicity of the tissues is extremely low simply by avoiding polyunsaturated fats.

**Andrew Murray:** So the organs from the animal with no PUFA in its diet had much less antigenic reaction in the recipient?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even though their genes and proteins should be antigenic, because they are free of the associated free radical breakdown products of oxidized fats, those proteins aren't recognized as foreign. You see similar things in liver transplants among humans. Females have higher levels of circulating polyunsaturated fats, which increase with age. The least successful, most antigenic livers come from older female donors, corresponding to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats.

## Caller: Gluten and Eye Health

**Caller:** I have a question about gluten. You mentioned that estrogen sensitizes the intestines to gluten. If someone stays off gluten, how long before they can try it again? Or do they have to stay off it forever?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think hormone balance makes the difference. If you get your defensive anti-inflammatory hormones up—including thyroid—you can improve. As the anti-inflammatory T3 part of the thyroid increases, the TSH (which is pro-inflammatory) decreases. High estrogen goes with low thyroid function and an inflammatory state resembling autoimmunity. I think the gluten reaction is a type of autoimmune reaction. You have to shift the whole organism so it acts properly rather than overreacting to inflammatory signals.

**Caller:** So if you do that, eventually you could eat gluten without a problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The intestine is a source of serotonin, nitric oxide, and histamine, which promote inflammation. These increase with stress and aging. Recent research shows that nitric oxide turns off steroid synthesis (starting with pregnenolone) in white blood cells. Since nitric oxide halts the anti-autoimmune process, you want to minimize exposure to serotonin, histamine, and nitric oxide while increasing anti-inflammatory processes.

**Caller:** Could you also give practical advice for age-related macular degeneration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is key. Sometimes aspirin helps by keeping down prostaglandins and polyunsaturated reactive oxygen species. Vitamin E, thyroid, aspirin, pregnenolone, and progesterone are all protective. Caffeine is another generally protective substance that blocks the toxic effects of nitric oxide.

**Caller:** So restoring energy production should regenerate the cells in the eye?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Cells tend to regenerate constantly in the brain, retina, and pancreas. Even in sick people, new stem cells are being born. The problem is keeping them from dying due to the stressful situation in the tissue.

## Caller: The Case for Vaccination

**Caller:** I’m calling from Humboldt. What I don't hear you addressing is that many diseases children get vaccinated for have been wiped out, and they were deadly. My father almost died of diphtheria; his cousin died of polio. Smallpox and tetanus were death sentences. Whatever harm vaccinations might cause, aren't they less harmful than the diseases they wiped out?

**Andrew Murray:** That can be contested, and that is the point of this show. People are currently dying from cancers, dementia, and Alzheimer's. Autism is rife. While these diseases had deadly consequences, Dr. Peat has noted that good hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition have done more to reduce disease than vaccination. It is the health of the organism that is the important factor. We aren't saying *carte blanche* that vaccinations shouldn't be used, but we want to highlight that nutrition, drug use, food quality, and environmental factors play a massive role.

**Caller:** A stronger immune system helps ward off diseases. I just wanted to know what you would do without vaccinations for these deadly diseases.

**Andrew Murray:** The goal is to open people's minds to things they may not have thought about. We often get brainwashed with only one side of the story.

## Caller: Homeopathy and Vaccine Efficacy

**Caller:** I'm a homeopath. There is a wonderful book by Richard Moskowitz called *Plain Doctoring* that offers a medical assessment of each vaccination. For instance, the whooping cough vaccine is terribly ineffective, which is partly why we see outbreaks despite high vaccination rates. Measles works well, but others like pertussis have terrible consequences. It should be a case-by-case basis. I might be interested in a tetanus shot, but not pertussis.

My great-grandfather died of smallpox. All his children had the vaccine and had horrible reactions—their legs got red and pussy. He was repelled by that and refused the vaccine, but then he caught smallpox and died. There should be some sanity, but currently, it seems driven by money.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for the book recommendation. Dr. Peat, let's discuss the adjuvant side of vaccinations and how these are proven to be toxic.

## Adjuvants and the Danger Theory

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the newer adjuvants of interest is phytol, a plant oily material. Heavy metals have been used as adjuvants for a long time and are pathogens themselves. Conventional immunologists realize that simple "foreignness" of a protein isn't enough to make it reactive or function as an antigen. They need to make the body treat it as dangerous to activate the immune system.

Following the trend Eli Metchnikoff sketched out, a few people brought innate immunity back to look at vaccination. It is now recognized as the "Danger or Damage Theory" of immunity. It used to be thought that the immune system recognized "otherness." Now, it is increasingly seen that *injury* triggers the immune system. The originators of this theory, Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger, showed that if you view the immune system as a developmental process, then pathogenic agents—radiation, heavy metals, toxic fats—are the real agents of damage. That is why they must be used with the bacterium or virus in a vaccine to trigger a response.

**Andrew Murray:** I remember thimerosal, the mercury-based preservative, caused a lot of damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people focus on the amount of mercury as a toxin, but it is really the way the tiny amount of toxin or adjuvant is presented that causes the problem. For example, kids whose mothers ate lots of seafood often have high IQs along with a high body load of mercury. In a healthy body, mercury isn't necessarily toxic. But when presented in a way that activates these adaptive defensive reactions, it can lead to autoimmunity. When they substitute phytol for aluminum or mercury, I think the effects are going to be just as bad, if not worse, because it is about potentiating the disturbing properties.

## Breastfeeding and Immunity

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had a listener who wanted Dr. Peat to comment on the effects of breastfeeding on the immune health of the child and its relationship to vaccines. Specifically, do the antibodies in breast milk offer a viable alternative to vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Besides being good nutrition, breast milk is extremely low in iron. Iron accumulates in the environment and leads to oxidative injury. Milk provides nutrition with a relative absence of harmful iron. It also provides immune-protective materials like antibodies and lactoferrin, which helps manipulate the body's iron load and prevents it from reacting with polyunsaturated fats.

Breastfeeding provides undamaged proteins that become part of the baby's immune system. Even RNA and DNA have been demonstrated to pass from the mother's milk into the baby. If you are raised on cow's or goat's milk, you get some protective factors, but you are likely incorporating some of that animal's genetic material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would a longer duration of breastfeeding, say beyond two years, lead to more active immunity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The mother's immunity shows up in the baby if the baby is breastfed for a couple of years. Part of that transfer is by microvesicles—little particles less than a thousandth the size of a cell containing proteins and RNA. These pass through the intestine wall and circulate as immune cells. They are like miniature stem cell repair kits.

Regarding duration, babies are usually born with an iron overload. By the time a baby is two years old, it has grown into that excess and might need iron-containing food like eggs. But the protective immunity is still being passed along up to three or four years.

## Conclusion: Developmental Health

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, we have just a few minutes left. Could you summarize your current understanding of the immune system and the perceived risks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the last 20 years, the image of the organism has become more like a continuing stream of developmental changes. We are essentially a big, slowly developing embryo. What happens during gestation and the first few years of life is critical because there are fewer cells involved, and each of those cells has a long history of descendants. The more you disturb the organism early in life, the greater the distortion in adulthood.

However, we are still in process even after middle age. Stem cells are still being educated. It is never too late to correct damage, but the early environment should be optimized by avoiding stresses.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there a point where an organism is fully protected?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two types of experiments in mice and rats that say a lot about human conditions. First, germ-free animals: even though they are susceptible to infection because they've never been exposed, they are very tough and resistant to other stresses. In middle age, their mortality rate is much lower, and they are resistant to obesity and diabetes even on high-sugar/fat diets.

The second line of experimentation involves giving animals a diet completely lacking in so-called "essential fatty acids" (PUFAs). These animals are extremely resistant to trauma, chemical poisoning, and biological toxins. They have an extremely strong immune system and are hard to infect. It takes a huge dose of injected cancer cells or bacteria to produce a viable infection.
