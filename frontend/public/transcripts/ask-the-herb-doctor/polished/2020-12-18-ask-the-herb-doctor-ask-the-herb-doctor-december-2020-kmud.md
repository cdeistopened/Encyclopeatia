## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. This is *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, they run the third Friday of every month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM. Our guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat, will be joining us. The evening's topic will be the continuation of the ongoing COVID infection rates across the states and the world, and what it means to people entering this new phase of the lockdown for the winter. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining. Just so people can get a feel for your background, would you cover your academic and professional background for them first?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For several years I worked in arts, literature, and linguistics, and then went to graduate school in biology from 1968 to 1972 for a PhD specializing in reproductive metabolism and aging.

## COVID-19, Inflammation, and Treatments

**Andrew Murray:** You've been a prolific author. You do a monthly newsletter and have published many articles on your website, all fully referenced. You are very science-based in your approach to understanding disease.

I wanted to carry on from where we left off last month regarding treatment strategies. The main reason for the deaths has been what they are calling a sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). It involves inflammation and watery secretions in the lungs that prevent oxygen and CO2 diffusion.

We covered strategies like expectorants to increase the removal of waste from the lungs. You mentioned bromhexine last month. The airway inflammation, hypersecretion of mucus, and impaired mucociliary effect all join together in a catastrophic event called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

Regarding treatments, I wanted to mention that licorice active constituents show brief expectorant and antiviral activity. You had mentioned azelastine, an antihistamine, last month. Because of their anti-inflammatory activity, antihistamines are well indicated for respiratory infections. Azelastine has also had an effect on inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection in trials.

I also wanted to mention frankincense. Papers written on frankincense talk about boswellic acid. This substance is an anti-inflammatory that blocks the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase and promotes the formation of leukotrienes. Put simply, the frankincense changes the inflammatory enzyme into an anti-inflammatory enzyme.

Looking at the death rate, Worldometer shows 1.68 million deaths worldwide. Compared to the 1918 pandemic, which had 50 to 70 million deaths, 1.68 million is a relatively small number. I'm not downplaying it—it is very sad for those who lost their lives—but the numbers have been played around with. What is your position on this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was late February or early March when someone asked me what I thought was going on. At that time, I said that from all the information about the virus infection I could find, basically nothing is happening. Every month since then, I haven't been able to find any government announcement based on fact that convinces me that anything has happened.

Naturally, every winter there is a pandemic, according to the World Health Organization's own definition: a disease that makes people sick and kills some of them, spreading across national boundaries. That happens every year with influenza, colds, and various coronaviruses. But they've basically changed the understanding of "pandemic." They changed the definition of how to tell what a person died of. They instructed people that if they find a trace of the virus using tests such as the PCR, they put the death down as caused by COVID, no matter what common sense says. If they were very sick with cancer, heart disease, or other lung disease, the death got recorded as coronavirus simply by order of the government.

If you look at the actual annual death rate from lung infections, basically nothing has happened. The only change in the annual seasonal pandemic is that it's now called COVID and diagnosed in very different ways from how diseases have been diagnosed historically.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you look at the overall excess mortality in the United States from January 2020 till now, are you saying that it has not changed in comparison to previous years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at the annual curve going back several decades, the peculiar thing—and Danny Rancourt has gone into detail on the chart of that particular month—is the second week of April of this year shows a phenomenon that never happens statistically. That week, the incidence of influenza fell off a cliff—a vertical decrease—the very week that there was a vertical increase spike in COVID. For that death curve to be a normal-looking curve, the name of what they died of suddenly changed from influenza to COVID.

People have pointed out that similar things happened in the past. When the polio vaccine came on the market, the number of people being paralyzed every year didn't change noticeably, but the diagnosis of polio suddenly stopped. They started being paralyzed by other things, given new names. That's really an advertising principle: change the name to make your product look really good.

## The Nature of Respiratory Illness and Sepsis

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You would expect people working in respiratory physiology to understand what influenza does. Despite the CDC reporting tens of thousands of deaths from influenza in previous years, when they actually tested for the virus, sometimes only a few dozen people had confirmed influenza.

For a long time, they've been calling this annual increase in mortality "influenza." But when tested, only a small percentage was actually caused by the influenza virus, a small percentage by coronaviruses, and some by bacteria. In half the cases tested, they couldn't find any microorganism that would cause the pneumonia. So the whole context of what people have been dying of for decades has not been based on science.

The experts say this new COVID virus is unique and horrible because it causes clotting disorders, strokes, lung fibrosis, and neurological infections. All of these things are classical, known symptoms of influenza infection.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If 50% of the people labeled as influenza deaths didn't have a pathogen they could identify, what did they actually die from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They died with pneumonia, but in at least half the cases, they couldn't identify a pathogen. It was probably stress causing endotoxin to leak out of their intestine. That always happens. Most known respiratory viruses attack the intestine, causing inflammation which leads to leakage into the blood vessels. This poisons the system, causing inflammation of the brain, disturbance of blood clotting, swelling of the lungs—the so-called cytokine storm.

If you are very old, weak, or have a major stressful sickness, the stress itself causes your intestine to become permeable. The endotoxin leaks into the whole body, causing systemic sepsis, multiple organ failure, and generalized intravascular coagulation. This is a condition that is almost a basic, universal end-of-life condition, no matter what is killing you.

## Media, Fear, and Medical Journals

**Andrew Murray:** I read a CBS News article by Dr. Jeremy Faust published in JAMA stating that young people (25-44) were dying at higher rates than during the HIV epidemic. However, I then found a CDC article confirming that young people face a negligible risk. It seems fear is a big motivator. I also saw that there is a 6.6% gain in Obamacare health insurance plans this year, likely motivated by fear.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's an example of how hard it is to find good information. People traditionally trusted JAMA, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and The Lancet. But last spring, when Trump spoke favorably about hydroxychloroquine, both NEJM and The Lancet published major research articles based on vast databases showing hydroxychloroquine kills people. It turned out that data was totally fabricated. The two greatest medical journals published frauds.

The journals have been revealing who they really work for: the drug companies. For example, one of the people on the FDA committee who voted to approve the Pfizer vaccine was the editor-in-chief of the NEJM, which takes advertising money from Pfizer. He published Pfizer's announcement—which was free of useful information—and described it as a triumph.

**Andrew Murray:** The CDC recently listed that influenza has essentially disappeared.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the CDC and WHO recognize this. In the 50 states and territories, nearly all show zero cases of influenza at the start of the high-incidence season.

## Caller: Saturated Fat Absorption and Thyroid Diagnosis

**Caller 1:** For older people, cholesterol typically drops and it's harder to convert to Vitamin D. If you were trying to increase your saturated fat to PUFA ratio, could you put cocoa butter on your skin? Would that have a positive impact?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You might absorb a moderate amount, maybe 5%. The old Greeks handled premature babies who were too weak to nurse by oiling them with olive oil. You can absorb it, but you couldn't really absorb a meaningful amount of saturated fat through your skin to change your ratio significantly.

**Caller 1:** Regarding diagnosing hypothyroidism, Broda Barnes mentions checking for an abnormal accumulation of mucopolysaccharides on the skin. Is that a valid diagnostic tool?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there are physical tests to estimate the quality of the skin, the amount of water and jelly in it. Those mucopolysaccharides will go away very quickly when you get the right amount of thyroid and get your metabolic rate up. If you use Barnes' books, you'll know how to deal with doctors who are focused on TSH rather than meaningful metrics like metabolic rate, reflexes, and nerve conduction time. TSH itself produces inflammation and many symptoms we blame on low thyroid.

## Caller: Flu Statistics vs. COVID Statistics

**Caller 2:** You said there are fewer deaths from COVID than influenza annually. But I've read that flu deaths are usually 24,000 to 62,000, and we are way over that with COVID. How can there be less?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CDC has been posting the absence of influenza cases this year. In previous years, they admitted that of the tens of thousands of deaths they listed as influenza, only a tiny fraction were actual demonstrable influenza virus infections. So, they changed the term to "Influenza-Like Illness" (ILI). This year, they are checking for influenza itself and finding a worldwide scarcity of it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But Dr. Peat, you said the overall mortality has not really changed this year compared to 2019?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The total mortality year after year always rises steeply from October to April. It's happening this year, except they are calling it COVID. It is a very similar curve to what was called influenza last year. Statistically, it suddenly changed about April 12th. Influenza came to an abrupt end when COVID started. It is as if COVID killed influenza. That has never been known, where one disease will start killing people at the same rate another one was while curing that disease.

## Caller: Sunlight, Glass, and Tanning

**Caller 3:** Does it make sense to spend about half an hour in direct sunlight to get UV for Vitamin D, and then spend the rest of the time behind glass to filter the UV? Also, is there a benefit to stained glass?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stained glass is mentally stimulating and biologically valuable. If you get too much ultraviolet radiation, the harm starts resembling damage done by ionizing radiation—it creates systemic inflammation. It's important not to burn. Vitamin D itself is protective and anti-inflammatory. If you take enough Vitamin D before going into the sunlight, many people find they tolerate the sun with much less tanning and no burning.

**Caller 3:** If you tan very darkly, does that mean something about your Vitamin D levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My guess is that light-skinned people who tan darkly are experiencing a pretty intense inflammation that turns on a strong defensive tanning reaction. It is definitely the injury that the skin is reacting to. Not burning is better than tanning.

## Ivermectin

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about Ivermectin. It's a dewormer used for river blindness and parasites, but studies show strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. What do you think about it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The good thing it has in its favor is it's been used for 35 years. It doesn't have a perfect safety record, but the vaccine has absolutely no safety record. If you had a choice between Ivermectin and the vaccine, considering safety, I don't see that there would be a choice.

However, if you think of taking it preventively every day for a long time, you get chronic effects. In some people, it produces autoimmune joint problems, arthritis, and liver reactions like chronic hepatitis. It's very promising in context, especially if you can't get safer treatments like aspirin or glucocorticoids, but it should be used for an emergency situation rather than as a long-term preventive.
