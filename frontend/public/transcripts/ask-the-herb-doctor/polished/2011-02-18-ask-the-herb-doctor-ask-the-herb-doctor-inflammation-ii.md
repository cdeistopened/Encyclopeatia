## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions. Tonight, we are discussing hormone replacement therapy (HRT), estrogen, and its inflammatory effects, as well as other popularly accepted hormones like serotonin, melatonin, and 5-HTP. We will discuss why they might not actually be that good for us. We are very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, who will be sharing his research and knowledge surrounding these topics.

Science, whilst responsible for many excellent breakthroughs, is unfortunately subject to the same scandals that beset many excellent thoughts. While studying physiology, I was subject to an indoctrination into an erroneous state of pseudo-fact. One of those things was the receptor model used in physiology regarding estrogen. This has been a perpetrator of much deceit on behalf of Big Pharma. Why was HRT so promoted, and how did the truth behind estrogen's effects get covered up?

Dr. Peat, for those who may have never heard of you, would you open up with your scientific background?

## Scientific Indoctrination and Background

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As a kid, I was interested in science, but I would read old medical books and encyclopedias. I very early got the impression that education was largely indoctrination. I found that literature as an undergraduate was a field where I could see the actual evidence—the material we were studying—without the interpretation of the professors.

It was years later that I finally decided to go to graduate school in science, when I realized I could get through it without having to fight with the professors; I could just be quiet and do what I wanted to do. I enrolled at the University of Oregon in the biology department, specializing in nerve biology. I was interested in how the brain could handle language and images. I saw that the whole direction of brain biology was towards a very reductionist computer analogy. Looking around the department, I saw that reproductive physiology was much more scientific, so I shifted over to that specialization.

## The History of Estrogen and Miscarriage

**Andrew Murray:** That word "indoctrination" is a very good place to start tonight's exposé regarding the scandal surrounding HRT. When I was studying, the receptor-ligand interaction was dogmatic. However, you have a very good understanding of the enzymatic background before it was taken over by corporate manufacturing. The whole estrogen receptor is a bit of a non-entity, I understand.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was 1970 when I was working on my dissertation. I was studying the metabolism of the uterus in aging animals, trying to understand why infertility came about in middle age. The particular metabolic studies I was doing corresponded to increased estrogenic stimulation with aging.

All the current textbooks in the 1960s were saying that menopause is when the ovaries wear out and stop producing estrogen. So, I read way back to about 1900 and up to the 1940s. I saw there was a sudden change in 1942. All through the 1930s and into the 1940s, researchers like Soderwall and Blandau were studying the effects of excess estrogen on the uterus. They showed that if you gave a graded dose, increasing amounts of estrogen caused miscarriage. The smallest dose would cause miscarriage at a very early stage. If you waited until very late in the pregnancy, it would take a bigger dose, but it was a continuous graded effect in which a slight excess of estrogen was sufficient to kill the developing embryo.

The hormones of the ovary were identified in the mid-1930s. The major substance produced in the ovary was progesterone, and estrogen was a minor substance. However, people doing research on how estrogen worked found that if you put a spoon in a candle flame and extracted the soot in a solvent, you could get hundreds of different estrogenic substances out of just soot. This was wonderful for the drug industries because everyone could find an estrogen to patent. But there was only one natural progesterone, so that was not a viable drug because no one had a patent on it.

By 1942, the 13 major estrogen companies had their synthetic estrogens. The scientific situation was that estrogen caused infertility and was associated with aging. But since they had products, they said, "Here we have the female hormone, and being female means being able to have babies, so estrogen must be what causes women to have babies." They wanted to sell it to millions of women. They came up with the idea that it would prevent miscarriage, even though the science said the opposite. They got a team at Harvard to promote the idea that Diethylstilbestrol (DES) would prevent miscarriages.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which is just awful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were prescribing it for years to prevent miscarriage and make a "healthier baby." It turned out that DES causes cancer and doesn't prevent miscarriage—it actually increases the risk. Just as it was getting recognized that DES causes cancer and deformity, they were getting interested in a new product: the birth control pill.

In the 1940s, they didn't want their drug company known as the "abortion producer." But by 1959 or 1960, contraception was becoming acceptable. They invented a story saying that if you take estrogen, it will suppress your body's estrogen and prevent miscarriage by lowering your estrogen. So, they came out with the contraceptive pill just as it was recognized that DES was causing miscarriages and cancer. They lost one product but immediately came out with another falsified story to sell the birth control pills.

## The Receptor Dogma vs. Enzymology

**Andrew Murray:** What is the truth behind whether estrogen binds to a specific receptor, and the lies surrounding the science produced to support the estrogen industry?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people doing the real science were trying to explain why estrogen had these toxic effects. They saw that natural estrogen was imitated by these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot, which were recognized carcinogens. They were studying the properties of soot and estrogen and finding that the substance tended to produce inflammation and cancer. These were activating enzyme systems in particular ways.

This reached a peak in the 1950s. The government moved some investment from chemical warfare into endocrine research. The opinion of many is that the intention was population control. They gave a big grant to a group led by Elwood Jensen. He wanted to create a new idea for how estrogen worked that would not involve all of this interesting chemistry explaining why estrogen was a toxin and carcinogen. He wanted to say that all it does is activate the "female genes"—that estrogen turns a switch that would only activate those female genes and not involve the nasty chemistry of cancer and inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But they knew that soot caused cancer in the late 1800s from the chimney sweeps.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was exactly what Jensen wanted people to forget. He wanted to say it's like a lock and key. The female organs have a very specific lock, and the estrogen is a key that sticks only into that lock.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Estrogen receptors are now known to be found all throughout the body, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And in men. But at that time, Elwood Jensen was arguing that there was just one little switch molecule in the cell. The Atomic Energy Commission gave him permission to use radioactive isotopes. His competition didn't have the grants or the isotopes. He labeled estrogen and claimed that there were no oxidative reactions in which estrogen participated. He published that in 1962.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they couldn't disprove it because the research up until that point had been showing estrogen causes cancer, but the drug companies wanted to sell the oral contraceptive pill, DES, and HRT.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. Jensen used the fancy isotope demonstration to say estrogen is not oxidized and reduced. But 10 or 15 years later, after the receptor dogma had been imposed, other people started using isotopes and showing that the older enzymologists were right. Estrogen does participate as a catalyst in enzyme reactions, especially transhydrogenation reactions that connect energy production to gene turnover and cell growth.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's how it initiates cancer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it allows the energy to be short-circuited over into the growth mechanism rather than the function mechanism. It drains the energy right out of function into growth.

## Estrogen and Water Structure

**Andrew Murray:** I'm interested in water. Modern science has shown that H2O exists in many different states. How does estrogen involve itself in redox reactions regarding cancer promotion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fastest change you can see in a cell within a minute or two of exposing it to estrogen is that it instantly starts taking up water. As it takes up water, the water gets out of the cell's control. That's part of this short-circuiting of the energy process. The microtubules, which are an organizing force in the cell, are depolymerized and disorganized in the presence of estrogen. That's part of the cancer problem—the cell can't communicate from one part to the other because the microtubules are messed up.

The water is normally under the control of adjoining surfaces, very unlike bulk water. But in the presence of estrogen, it becomes bulk-like. One of my experiments was to put an old uterus, a young uterus, and an estrogen-treated uterus in an MRI machine. We showed that the old uterus and the estrogen-treated uterus had loose, disorganized water that could be distinguished from the young, healthy uterus.

## HRT, Serotonin, and Bone Loss

**Andrew Murray:** Give me your opinion on HRT's effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The industry succeeded so greatly in turning science upside down in the case of estrogen that it took a lot of other hormones with it. Progesterone was suppressed because it would cure the things estrogen was claimed to cure, but it couldn't be patented.

Prolactin had many toxic effects that were well recognized, but since estrogen increases prolactin, there was pressure not to think about the fact that prolactin causes bone loss and osteoporosis.

Serotonin is another thing strongly influenced by this inverted interpretation. Estrogen increases exposure to serotonin. Serotonin is one of the means by which estrogen increases prolactin, and serotonin does many of the harmful things estrogen and prolactin do, including being a direct cause of bone loss. People who take fluoxetine-type antidepressants (SSRIs) are seen to have premature bone loss because of the excess exposure to serotonin. Serotonin is a cofactor for estrogen; estrogen increases serotonin, and serotonin increases the production of estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We're all told that serotonin is the "feel good" hormone and they give you SSRIs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the currently bad effects of serotonin excess that is getting some recognition is hypertension of the pulmonary artery. The drugs that increase serotonin increase this pulmonary hypertension and degeneration of the valves in the right side of the heart. This was known in the 1950s as the main deadly complication of having a serotonin-producing tumor. Finally, 60 years later, it's being recognized as a way to treat pulmonary hypertension by using anti-serotonin drugs.

## Caller: 5-HTP and Depression

**Caller:** I sometimes have a tendency toward depression. I resisted trying Zoloft or Prozac, but I was told by nature doctors to try 5-HTP. They said it was natural and would help me use my own serotonin better. Is that not good for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Prozac-type drugs keep the platelets and nerve cells from binding and keeping serotonin out of the way, leading to overexposure. Plain tryptophan is bad enough, but 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) is one step closer to being serotonin.

**Caller:** So you think it's not good for me to take it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything I know suggests that. For example, there is an increased risk of breast cancer and obesity.

**Caller:** How can it increase obesity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By slowing metabolism and suppressing the thyroid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's basically providing the precursor, and your body makes more serotonin out of it. The effects of excess serotonin increase estrogen, which slows your liver's metabolism. That can slow your thyroid down, lead to obesity, and promote cancer.

**Caller:** It says it elevates your mood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You have to weigh it up. It might elevate your mood, but you also risk these other things. They used to give X-rays for acne, and people got cancer.

**Caller:** I certainly don't want to slow my metabolism. I'm done with menopause, so I figure my estrogen has balanced itself out. I'm specifically talking about 5-HTP from the health food store, which seems benign.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's all part of the same system. If the body naturally produces serotonin in the bowel, and a little bit stimulates inflammation and degeneration, you wouldn't want to increase that even through natural means.

**Caller:** So I should probably do without it and see if my food is okay.

**Andrew Murray:** Unfortunately, the short-term gain is not worth the price of the long-term sequelae of disease processes.

## Caller: Asthma and Serotonin

**Caller:** I've talked to you before and I've gotten completely off my serotonin reuptake inhibitors. One effect of stopping is that I've been able to stop using steroids in an inhaler. My asthma has gone away completely. I think you said on your website that serotonin relates to asthma?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, estrogen is related to asthma too. The effect of serotonin is to cause localized contraction of the tubes in your lungs as well as causing them to take up water and promote inflammation. The contraction is the thing best studied in connection with asthma.

**Caller:** It went away within four weeks. I coughed up a lot of fluid for a week, but after that, it cleared up. Getting off the serotonin was painful, but I'm very grateful.

## Caller: Types of Estrogen

**Caller:** I haven't heard mention of the three different types of estrogen in our bodies: estriol, estrone, and estradiol. They have a hugely disparate impact on our bodies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are probably a dozen important types of estrogen, but the three main types—estriol, estrone, and estradiol—have pretty much the same effects, just at different potencies. If you can turn your most potent estradiol into the others, you're protected against some of the most toxic effects. During pregnancy, the index of a healthy pregnancy is when estriol is high, because that means you're destroying your estradiol very quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So estradiol is the most dangerous form.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And these different forms are exactly the issue that Elwood Jensen denied happened. He said estradiol can't turn into estrone and estriol, but in fact, that's a major way of inactivating estrogen according to the cell's energy system.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the only reason you'd want high estriol is because that tells us the estradiol is being detoxified. Not that high estriol in itself is protective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's about 10 times weaker than estrogen. Every little bit of estradiol that you turn to estriol is a down-stepping of your estrogen effect.

## Caller: Birth Control Safety

**Caller:** What is your opinion on modern birth control methods like the pill or the NuvaRing? Are they safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They tremendously decreased the amount of estrogen in the contraceptives, but if it's strong enough to kill the embryo, it's strong enough to do damage to the woman. About 30 years ago, there was agitation for FDA approval of the traditional cervical cap—a metal casting made to fit the cervix exactly. The FDA wouldn't approve that but approved a rubber one that didn't work well. I think it was because they were simply working for the contraceptive pill.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** As far as IUDs, they now have IUDs that secrete a small amount of hormone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The signal from inside the uterus travels through nerves to prevent the ovary from producing the amount of progesterone it should. So any kind of IUD, with or without hormones, will create a hormonal imbalance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thereby increasing your estrogen and risk of cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** So is there anything else other than natural birth control?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the rhythm cycle method is the best.

## Melatonin

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think of melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has its own endocrine problems. It can disturb your progesterone and thyroid production if you take a lot of it. But its function seems to be a way of detoxifying serotonin. The trigger that turns the conversion in the pineal gland of serotonin into melatonin is the adrenergic stress-related nerves. During the night, your stress increases from the lack of light, and this system causes the pineal to convert serotonin to melatonin.

Biologically, it's evidence that you are responding to stress with a detoxifying process. The enzymes in the pineal activated by stress can also be found in inflamed joint tissue and breast cancer. Serotonin is involved in the pathology of those situations, so if our enzymes could turn it more quickly into melatonin, there would be less of a serotonin problem.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But when people actually take melatonin supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's probably protecting against circulating serotonin. But in itself, in an otherwise healthy person, animal studies showed it was capable of lowering both progesterone and thyroid while increasing estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in a short-term emergency, it could be okay, but long-term it has negative side effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, though it is much safer than serotonin.

## Caller: Vaginal Estrogen

**Caller:** I take a suppository called Vagifem for dryness. The package says it's estradiol. Should I worry?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have been studied using vaginal creams, and their blood level of estrogen was even higher than some of the oral pills were causing. It is definitely a systemic hormonal influence.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What would you recommend to this lady to use in place of her suppository?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known several women who had pharmacists make suppositories with a fairly high dose of vitamin A and a little vitamin E in cocoa butter. The vitamin A helps to strengthen the membranes and normalize mucus production.

## Caller: Bioidentical Hormones

**Caller:** What do you think of bioidentical hormones in low doses, derived from wild yams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All hormones, even bioidentical ones, have to fit into the system in a balanced way. When you supplement estrogen or serotonin, you're most likely increasing something that's already excessive. The doctrine of replacement with natural hormones builds on the history of synthetic hormone replacement.

What they neglect is that as a woman ages from 19 to 39, there is a steady average increase in the amount of estrogen in her bloodstream. In the 40s, progesterone production is no longer able to keep up with this steadily increasing estrogen. As soon as progesterone decreases and can no longer force estrogen out of the cells, the blood estrogen level will drop, but the estrogen *inside* the cells will increase.

Publications have shown that the tissues of old organisms retain much more estrogen than the tissues of young animals. The fact that you don't find it in the blood is simply because estrogen sticks inside the cells in proportion to the deficiency of progesterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the reason they recommended it is because of low blood levels, but Dr. Peat's advice would be to not use it.
