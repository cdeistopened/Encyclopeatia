## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville. From 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of alkalinity versus acidity with reference to disease.

We're very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat to share his wisdom and expertise with us for this next hour. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for joining us. Would you give the listeners who perhaps have never heard you before a rundown of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology at the University of Oregon and have since about 1970 just continued on my own, figuring things out, talking to a lot of people, and listening to their problems. Almost every time I talk to someone, I learn something about physiology. It's a very complex, continuing thing.

**Andrew Murray:** You did a PhD in physiology based on hormones, didn't you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, reproductive physiology and aging was the subject of my dissertation.

## The Acid vs. Alkaline Diet Debate

**Andrew Murray:** We really enjoy having you here because you provide the scientific reference for what most people just spout out as truth. It’s refreshing to have the science behind the reasons why.

This month, I want to discuss alkalinity and acidity. Generally, the main reference for cancer is that cancers seem to predominate in acidic environments. The idea is that our diets—through poor proteins or protein-based foods like beans, seeds, and meats—produce acidic byproducts. How do you look at these traditional ideas about the acid-base balance of food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They usually lead to a pretty good diet. For example, the Indian diet—fruit, vegetables, milk, and cheese—is a good example of the alkaline residue diet. I don't have any disagreement with the dietary recommendations to eat lots of milk, cheese, fruit, and vegetables.

But it's the small details that people use to argue for certain refinements of that diet. For example, the fear of milk. They talk about the loss of calcium in the urine as indicating that maybe it's too much acid. But actually, the residue of milk is on the alkaline side because of the very large amount of potassium and calcium in the milk. It is very similar to the vegetables that the cows eat to make the milk; they accumulate a huge amount of alkaline minerals.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about that subject a little bit more. The residue is what's left behind once the food source has been metabolized, and that dictates whether a food is alkaline or acidic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And grains, nuts, beans, and meats do have a very acidic residue or ash after they're metabolized. The biggest part of that in meat, nuts, and grains is phosphate. Proteins have a lot of sulfur which turns into sulfuric acid when it's metabolized. It is possible to do biological harm by eating too much of those and not enough of the potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium side.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which are predominantly found in fruits and vegetables.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, fruits, vegetables, milk, and cheese.

## Physiology of Acidity: CO2 and Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** Would you run through some of the more commonly experienced acidic production processes in the body, whether respiratory or in producing urine, and how the body deals with maintaining the pH balance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it helps to look at the picture in the very biggest context, which is that mostly we're a huge lump of protein, and protein is, on average, acidic. If you just leave acid sitting around in the environment, it will accumulate the base that neutralizes it. So, if we think of ourselves as a big piece of acidic protein, this spontaneously will associate alkaline material with it. Potassium and magnesium, for example, will neutralize the acidity of the protein.

But as we energize our system by burning carbohydrate and fat, the carbohydrate in particular turns into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide has to constantly be leaving the organism. What comes in is oxygen. The oxygen combines with the fuel carbon and becomes carbon dioxide. So you have a neutral oxygen coming in, and it was historically called "oxygen" meaning the "acid former." The acid that it forms in this case is carbonic acid.

We're constantly metabolically producing this acid, which is streaming out of our cells and leaving through our lungs primarily. As the carbon dioxide is produced, combining with water, it turns into carbonic acid, which ionizes. So you have the acidic carbonic acid leaving the cell as a charged particle. It takes the oppositely charged sodium with it. Primarily sodium and calcium are constantly being drawn out of the cell by the stream of carbonic acid being produced inside the cell.

The alkaline minerals reach the bloodstream in balance with the carbonic acid. Then the carbonic acid leaves the lungs as carbon dioxide, leaving an alkaline trace in the blood. The cell basically was neutral until it produced the acid. Then that neutralized protein gave up some of its mineral alkaline material, which then shows up in the blood. So the pH of the blood is above neutral, about pH 7.4.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because of the carbonic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In this healthy metabolism, the mineral gets pulled out of the neutral cell. As it's pulled out with the acid being constantly formed, the cell shows its basic protein acidity. So, the respiring cell is normally slightly on the acidic side. A good, healthy cell with plenty of oxygen will be around pH 6.6 to 6.8.

If you stress a cell so it isn't getting enough carbon dioxide—or stress it in any way, like radiation or lack of oxygen—the cell becomes activated and shifts to the alkaline because it can't make carbon dioxide to acidify itself. It begins producing lactic acid very inefficiently.

The thing about lactic acid is that the sugar, instead of being oxidized all the way to carbon dioxide, comes to the point of pyruvic acid. Instead of that being oxidized, the cell reduces the pyruvic acid to lactic acid. In that process, the lactic acid is taking protons out of the cell and is raising the pH of the cell. The conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid increases the pH of the cell—just the opposite of what the production of carbon dioxide was doing. So the stressed cell becomes alkaline.

## Cancer, Lactic Acid, and Inflammation

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When the popular theory is stated that cancer cells like an acidic environment, it sounds like if a cell is stressed, it likes an alkaline environment. That sounds almost exactly opposite.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it shifts internally to become alkaline when it's stressed. But the produced lactic acid accumulates in its environment, and that's where the acid is—in the surroundings. And then it shows up in the blood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's like if you've stressed your muscle out too much, you're producing lactic acid and that makes your muscles sore. That's a stressed cell. Does lactic acid play a big part in cancer as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It not only acidifies the environment—which in itself could be actually protective if it was acidified by carbon dioxide—but it happens that the lactic acid acts as a signal to do all of the things associated with cancer. It stimulates the growth of new blood vessels so that the inflammation continues. It signals a lot of inflammatory changes, vasodilation, and the release of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, producing free radicals and injury.

The lactic acid is functioning as a local poison or inflammatory agent. The acidity that it produces is a sign that something is wrong, but it isn't the acidity in the tumor that's harmful, because the tumor itself is internally alkaline.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What do you think of foods that are high in lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even when we make it ourselves, it has these pro-inflammatory, swelling-producing, tumor-promoting functions. When it's made by bacteria, it's somewhat more toxic. When the body receives it—either from a stressed muscle, a tumor, or from too much yogurt or fermented food—it goes to the liver to get detoxified.

Every time you eat something with lactic acid, it's the same as if you had been stressed physically. Your liver has to work extra to detoxify it. It has to have a source of energy to detoxify the lactic acid, turning it back into glucose. And the glucose is right back where you started. So you've lost ground every time your liver has to process lactic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would you consider any amount of lactic acid-containing food to be a stress to the liver, or is there some margin of benefit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A healthy liver doesn't notice an occasional dish of yogurt or sauerkraut. But how I got interested in it was a long time ago. I discovered kefir in a store. It tasted good, so I drank a little more than a cup of it each day for lunch. Every time I did that, I would get a migraine-like headache every afternoon. That started me looking up what happens to your blood sugar and inflammatory mediators when you get more lactic acid than your liver likes.

## Stress and the "Acidic Lifestyle"

**Andrew Murray:** How do you think about people's lifestyles promoting an acidic situation from stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nervous system is in control of metabolism to a great extent, so you don't have to run five miles to shift over into that stress metabolism. If your nervous system and emotional systems are very stressed, just the thought of what you're doing can cause it.

I mentioned before that if you hang an animal by its tail or put it in a tube where it can't move, it will very quickly get an ulcer with lactic acid going to all of its systems, releasing histamine and serotonin. But if you give something for the animal to bite, even though it's in the same restrained, stressful situation, as long as it can defend itself by biting back, it doesn't get the ulcer.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think this explains why people say that as long as you let anger out, you generally don't get cancer, but people who hold it in get cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The rat experiment really suggests that.

**Andrew Murray:** So if we coin the term "an acidic lifestyle"—the stressed businessman trying to meet deadlines—is that a potential situation where cancer could arise because of the acidity from stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it is actually things like lactic acid and serotonin. The stress really is doing its damage by creating an *intracellular alkaline* condition.

For example, when someone is under surgery, they often get ulcers just from being operated on. That stress will very often give them lung inflammation and brain inflammation. They found, 60 or 70 years after people originally discovered it, that if they don't ventilate patients very thoroughly and let them accumulate quite a bit of carbon dioxide, their lungs and brain are protected and don't swell. So the acidity from carbon dioxide is extremely anti-stress and protective. It's the alkalinity that goes with producing lactic acid which does the harm.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people get stomach ulcers if they're stressed because instead of their cells in their stomach holding onto the acid, it's releasing it into the environment and damaging the stomach lining?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's really the serotonin and other inflammatory things in the stomach rather than just the acid. The stomach is very good at holding extreme acidity safely. But when stress gives the wrong kind of signals and you don't have continuing respiration, then you get the damage.

## Alkaline Minerals and Fasting

**Andrew Murray:** How realistic is it to consume alkalizing materials and how would that affect the overall acid-base balance when the stomach is so acidic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's very safe to consume a great excess of the alkaline material, which the fruit, vegetable, milk, and cheese people do. The body can change protein into ammonium. If it doesn't have enough minerals, it will waste protein, turning it into the equivalent of the alkaline material and using the ammonia as the cation equivalent of the sodium so it can save the sodium and calcium.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think consuming things that have an excess of potassium, magnesium, and calcium can actively work to raise the pH of someone's environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think their main function is sparing protein that you would use for the kidneys to help regulate the minerals. For example, when a person is fasting for several days, they will generally lose more protein than fat because the stress hormones rise. They live on a pure meat diet [internally] when they're fasting, as their tissues break down. If you just drink the minerals—salt water, baking soda, potassium, some magnesium and calcium—any of the alkaline minerals will radically spare the amount of protein that you would be consuming and wasting. So a fast is much less stressful and harmful if you are getting the alkaline minerals.

## Caller: Panic Attacks and Bag Breathing

**Caller:** Is the carbon dioxide circulation or exchange that the doctor just spoke of why it's so calming to rebreathe carbon dioxide when you're in stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Stress shifting to the alkaline and making lactic acid means the cells are in danger of getting into a chronically activated state. The panic attack is a typical thing where the body too easily shifts over into making lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. The person feels that they're suffocating.

In the long run, that same thing can lead to degenerative diseases or cancer in which the cells are stuck in a "panic attack" condition. If you think of the original state of the cell as being the protein acid which attracts the minerals to neutralize the acid, you can restore that condition with carbon dioxide. Just rebreathing it, getting your percentage of the acidic carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood up where it should be, you can stop the production of lactic acid, reverse these stress processes, and restore the cell to its relaxed, un-panicked condition.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's through bag breathing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. For example, you can generally lower your blood pressure just breathing a minute or two in a paper bag a few times a day. I've seen people take their blood pressure down 30 points in just a day or two that way.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it really is a de-stressor not only for the mental state but for all the other cellular states that are panicking.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Every cell or tissue is protected if you restore the proper amount of carbon dioxide. Breathing in a bag is one of the most powerful ways to restore the proper balance. If you need more bicarbonate, the gaseous carbon dioxide will allow you to make more bicarbonate, and that will help you regulate your minerals and help you retain more of your alkaline minerals.

Taking sodium bicarbonate, for example, will actually acidify cells that are in need of more carbon dioxide. When the bicarbonate has been deficient, when a cell is exposed to the bicarbonate, it will convert it into the acidic carbon dioxide and be able to lower its pH, even though you've taken the alkaline baking soda.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that why you recommend baking soda for athletes? To help balance out high lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there have been experiments in marathon or bicycle races in Death Valley where the altitude is very low. They found that a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of the race made them tolerate the stress much better.

## Caller: Smoking and Carbon Dioxide

**Caller:** I heard a study that in Japan, despite being the highest smoking population, the mortality rate is lower than in America. Does smoking increase that carbon dioxide to relax the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The carbon monoxide is something that we produce under stress, and it lowers our ability to use oxygen and to produce carbon dioxide.

**Andrew Murray:** And carbon monoxide is what you inhale as part of cigarette smoking.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** So the carbon monoxide from smoking is pretty damaging and it's not something that would improve your CO2 content.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you have any thoughts as to why the Japanese culture has such longevity compared to us, especially since they consume a lot of tobacco?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, much of that is propaganda. When you look at the actual details of the population, it isn't as great as some of the articles have been saying. For example, one of the articles, if you look at the mortality figures, suggests that the average lifespan is 300 years. If you don't look at the whole structure of the population, it's hard to get an idea of what the real age-specific death rate is.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So back to the caller's question, you don't think that smoking raises carbon dioxide in any way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does, but it raises the carbon monoxide so seriously that that's the main thing that takes over. It's harmful.

## Bicarbonate Types and Diet Recommendations

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned sodium bicarbonate for the athletes in Death Valley. Is potassium bicarbonate something that could be used similarly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the average person is very good at getting rid of sodium, so sodium bicarbonate is something most people can use without experiencing edema or disturbance of blood pressure. The potassium bicarbonate has a relaxing effect on your blood vessels, so it can help to lower your blood pressure even more than the sodium bicarbonate. But you have to be cautious because too much of it can relax your heart too much.

**Andrew Murray:** What would be an ideal lifestyle that you would suggest for people thinking about acid, alkalinity, and cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only foods I would suggest eliminating would be the grains, beans, most of the nuts, and probably reducing most meats. Gelatin happens to be the part of the meat that doesn't have so many of the disturbing acidic, pro-inflammatory effects. In the news currently is the "pink slime" issue, which is made from connective tissues. But it seems to me that that might be the best part of the meat.

## Caller: Baking Soda Baths for Sore Muscles

**Caller:** Whenever I do short walks, I get muscle soreness for a couple of days afterwards. I assumed I'm making too much lactic acid. I started taking baking soda baths with about two pounds of baking soda. Is that safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's good. Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) and baking soda are all good. The baking soda helps you absorb magnesium if you have Epsom salts mixed with it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that's a good combo, like maybe one pound baking soda and one pound Epsom salts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Experimenters in naturally carbonated mineral springs found that people were absorbing carbon dioxide through their skin. Even though their body contains a lot of carbon dioxide, the body has such an affinity for it that it will soak it up from the mineral water against the gradient. It's as if we had pumps in our skin.

## Vitamin C and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** I recall a reference to cancer treatment purporting the use of ascorbate at the rate of up to 130 grams a day. It was supposedly keeping certain types of cancer from growing. Do you know much about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They keep changing the technology. I don't know exactly what they're doing now, but as recently as about 10 years ago, a free radical chemist dissolved a gram of pure powdered ascorbic acid in a liter of distilled water and found that there were enough heavy metals in that purified Vitamin C to produce as many free radicals as a killing dose of X-rays would have produced.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Oh, my goodness. So citrus season is a great source of Vitamin C.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. All of our foods except the grains and beans are very good sources of Vitamin C. The analytic methods have generally ignored it in meat and some solid foods, but it's present in meats at a very high concentration in the oxidized state. All you have to do is metabolize it and you turn the oxidized ascorbic acid into the common ascorbic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that the theory why concentrated orange juice still has absorbable Vitamin C? It's just a slightly changed form when you boil it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Most of the tests don't really look at the molecule, they just look at the reducing power. In some vegetables and meats, the tissue has oxidized it partly into dehydroascorbic acid, but as soon as you eat it, it turns back into ordinary ascorbic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They say in Britain it was the fish and chips that prevented the British people from developing scurvy because potatoes have quite a lot of Vitamin C in them as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and fish.

## Cancer Metabolism and Gerson Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** What would be the best way of maintaining enough energy in the body to deal with cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The so-called alkaline ash diet—lots of fruits, vegetables, milk, and cheese—will help to let the stressed cancer cell repair itself as far as it can. Breathing in a paper bag to increase the carbon dioxide is probably helpful.

As long ago as 1910, the insurance companies knew that people who lived at very high altitudes had a very low cancer mortality. That has been tested experimentally. Fifty years ago, they implanted tumors in rats. Leaving them near sea level, all of them quickly died. Taking them up to 17,000 ft altitude, half of them threw off the cancers and had no symptoms left just from the carbon dioxide retention when the oxygen tension was lowered.

The carbon dioxide assures the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Heavy breathing, or hyperventilating, is a way to lower the oxygen in your tissues because you blow out the carbon dioxide, and you need a lot of carbon dioxide in your tissue to deliver the oxygen.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about Gerson Therapy and what he was putting forward as a diet for anti-cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I happened to get a copy of his book just a few years after he died in the early 1960s. I was very impressed by his detailed studies. He seemed to have read just about everything about cancer in the first half of the 20th century. The minerals are a very important part of it, and restoring the oxidative metabolism. He regularly gave his people Armour Thyroid. I think two grains was a very common dose for these patients.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you were suddenly without the ability to get Armour Thyroid, how much of a mammal's thyroid would you need to eat to get the dose you needed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Armour product was standardized to imitate the fresh glandular weight. They would defat the gland, powder it, and then dilute it with glucose or lactic acid to increase the weight until it was similar to the fresh piece of gland. They called that the normal dilution. The powder itself was called the 3x concentrate, meaning that the gland is three times more concentrated than the old Armour Thyroid pills. That means that 1 gram of the [dried] gland is equal to 15 grains of Armour Thyroid.

## Caller: The "Death Valley Milkshake"

**Caller:** What would a double latte espresso pink slime milkshake with baking soda do for an athlete's performance in the Death Valley race?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the caffeine tends to enhance performance in mysterious ways. The gelatin has an anti-stress effect. That mixture seems like it would be pretty good: baking soda, gelatin content. You would need quite a bit of sugar with it, preferably fructose.

**Andrew Murray:** That brings up another question. I've read that cancers feed on sugar and you've got to starve a cancer from sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, they feed on amino acids and turn the amino acids into sugar, and then turn some of the sugar back into fat. Then they metabolize the fat. With all that silly chemistry, they produce a lot of heat with no light or function to speak of. That's why you can identify a cancer because it's so hot—it's burning protein, turning it into amino acids and into sugar, then into fat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So is that why thermography is quite an accurate way at looking for cancers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And so if you can feed it as much sugar as it wants, then it won't eat your protein, at least not so fast.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Okay, so it could prevent the wasting disease associated with cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And saturated fats aren't probably as good as sugar for quieting stressed tissues, but they do have specific anti-stress functions. I would recommend avoiding all of the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) because those turn on the stress reactions—increase your adrenal corticoids, adrenaline, pituitary hormones, and so on. The saturated fats inhibit those same stress systems.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just for our listeners, the PUFA is the liquid vegetable oils, not including olive oil. Coconut oil, beef and lamb fat, butter, and cream are the saturated fats.

## Liver Extracts and Salt

**Andrew Murray:** Going back to the Gerson diet, what was with the injected liver extracts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a way to get all of the essential nutrients. Around the time I read his book, I met Leonell Strong, who developed the cancer-prone strains of mice. He had been curing cancer just with an extract of liver. That was my first research project, trying to find out what it was in the liver extracts that could cure cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Gerson also wanted to eliminate salt from a diet. That's strange to me because I know you're an advocate of salt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another person who studied cancer at the very basic level was William Frederick Koch. Working on the parathyroid hormone, he found that the alkaline minerals to a tremendous extent would substitute for each other. You can take out the parathyroid glands, which causes a calcium problem, but you could cure that with sodium or potassium or magnesium.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the salt could replace the calcium or the potassium or the magnesium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, to a great extent. Any of those alkaline minerals can replace the others. So you don't have to worry about the balance so much because having an excess, your body can sort them out.

## Caller: Potato Protein

**Caller:** I'm vegan and looking for different sources of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Potatoes are the best vegetable protein known. They're better than eggs in terms of quality. They have 106% of the protein quality ranked next to egg yolk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. So 8 ounces of potato has 8 grams of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you consider you're eating the starch too, a liter of potato is like a liter of milk on average.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you make potato juice and don't drink the starch that settles out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Make the juice, then it's more like eating pure egg yolk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you can even make a scrambled egg-like preparation from potato juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen it for people with mysterious ailments who seem to be dying. One or two meals and they just popped out of it. No one really knew what was wrong with them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You'd recommend cooking it, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My experience is just with cooking, it's like scrambling an egg.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah. Let the starch settle out before you cook it.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for joining us, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you very much.
