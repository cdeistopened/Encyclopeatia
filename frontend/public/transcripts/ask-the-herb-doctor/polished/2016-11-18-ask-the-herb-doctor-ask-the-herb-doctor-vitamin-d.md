## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. Sarah won't be with us this month, but she will be back in December. We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with patients about a wide range of conditions, recommending herbs, supplements, and nutritional counseling.

This month's talk is on Vitamin D. Most people will recognize Vitamin D from rickets in the early 1900s. In England and many countries north of 37 degrees latitude, there is insufficient sunlight, especially in the winter months, to generate Vitamin D. Rickets was a fairly common condition and still is in some parts of the world. We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. He is a wealth of information, and his insights are, as always, outside the box. Thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** Could you outline your professional and academic background for those who haven't listened before?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically, I have a PhD in biology, including reproductive physiology and biochemistry, from the University of Oregon.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you have a research background leading in many directions, including steroids, their production, and anti-aging effects. Now, Vitamin D is actually a pro-hormone; it is not, strictly speaking, a vitamin, is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

## Vitamin D History and Misconceptions

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the discovery of Vitamin D and its association with rickets, do you think there is adequate Vitamin D in the general population?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For preventing rickets, yes. There is very little rickets left around the world. But since the idea of Vitamin D as a rickets-preventing substance was established, that really cut off thinking and research about what Vitamin D really is and what it is doing.

In the 1950s, there was a period when people started thinking about nutrition for themselves—Adele Davis's books came out, for example—and the medical establishment reacted to discourage the public from using their own therapy. There were stories about how horribly toxic Vitamin A was, claiming it would destroy your brain and make your skin fall off, with very little evidence backing it up. You have to give rats and mice a million or so units of Vitamin A to poison them.

There were similar animal experiments with gigantic doses of Vitamin D. Supposedly, there was a case of a baby whose mother took a million or so units of Vitamin D while pregnant, and it supposedly caused the bones to thicken so much that there was no room for the brain to develop. The newspaper stories in the 50s were saying that Vitamin D causes brain damage. Despite reading Adele Davis, I was directed away from Vitamin D because there was such a taboo about taking anything more than 200 or 300 units per day.

**Andrew Murray:** It is interesting you say rickets is relatively unknown. In England, specifically northern England, reports suggest rickets is starting to appear again. The advent of fear-mongering regarding skin cancer, melanoma, the use of sunscreens, and the inherent phobia about being in the sun has been implicated in the British Medical Journal as causative for the rise in rickets.

Regarding blood tests, the beneficial levels have been raised. The lower limit used to be 20 nanograms per milliliter, and now they have raised that to 30. Many are advocating levels of 50 to 70 nanograms. For athletes, studies show positive associations with 100 nanograms per milliliter. What do you think about the tendency in the population to have low levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several conditions associated with Vitamin D deficiency have doubled and tripled in the last 20 to 30 years. It looks like it is because of that fear of sunlight and using sunscreen. I've talked to people who had levels of 10 nanograms per milliliter or below. One woman in her 60s said she was so weak she could hardly walk; her muscles were simply very weak and shrunken. She had levels of 7 or 8. Within a week of taking a moderate dose—I think it was 5,000 units a day—she could walk around.

When you look at the symptoms of people with levels of 15, 20, or 25, you can see gradations of that weakness, depression, shrinking muscles, insensitivity to insulin, and a tendency to have high blood sugar. These are the most common diseases of stress.

**Andrew Murray:** High blood pressure is also positively associated with lower levels of Vitamin D, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Everything related to aging, degeneration, and stress: atrial fibrillation, enlargement of the ventricle, calcification of the valves, hardening of the arteries, calcification of the coronary arteries, and even calcification to the extent of what they call a "heart stone"—a huge mass of calcium.

## Calcium, Phosphate, and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** I think most people associate Vitamin D with calcium and phosphorus metabolism, weak bones, and osteomalacia. But there is a clear link to energy production and inflammation. You have spoken before about how inflammatory processes are extremely destructive to energy production.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D helps to balance the relation between calcium and phosphate, preventing the over-accumulation of phosphate and keeping up the right level of calcium. When you look at the relation of that balance to inflammation, it turns out that the amount of phosphate relative to calcium is a serious problem in the population.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that because people aren't eating enough dairy or green leaves?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Green leaves, cheese, and milk are the major good sources of calcium. Meat, nuts, grains, and beans have terrifically high phosphate content. The excess phosphate—and the reaction of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) to that high phosphate intake—is exactly the same as a deficiency of Vitamin D.

Too much phosphate and too little Vitamin D results in what amounts to an early stage of chronic kidney degeneration. Parathyroid hormone and phosphate are called uremic toxins in late-stage kidney disease, but people are starting that process very early when they don't eat enough calcium and Vitamin D.

## Sunlight and Vitamin D Sources

**Andrew Murray:** I want to talk about the natural conversion in the skin. I read that washing directly after sunbathing was counterproductive because you can wash the precursor metabolite off the skin. I also read that only 20 minutes was necessary to produce peak amounts of the pro-hormone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is only when you are in the middle of the day at a moderate latitude. The UVB is so low most of the year in high latitudes that it takes a long time to get enough. But from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM in the summer at high latitudes, it only takes 15 or 20 minutes to get enough.

**Andrew Murray:** So if you are in San Francisco, from September through April, you probably aren't getting enough sunlight.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Also, the natural color of your skin makes a tremendous difference, as does age. There is apparently less cholesterol metabolism in an old person. The degree of pigmentation influences the reaction to ultraviolet light. In Mexico, for example, women with dark skin who are outside all day—but only exposing their face and hands—tend to be deficient in Vitamin D, even at high altitude and in brilliant sunlight.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think people get enough Vitamin D from the food they eat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that's almost impossible. Even if you drink two to four quarts of Vitamin D supplemented milk. If it isn't whole milk, legally it has to be supplemented, but that is only around 300 units per quart.

**Andrew Murray:** And modern levels advocated are up to 2,000 to 4,000 IU per day. Are there other Vitamin D rich foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mushrooms exposed to light have a lot. Interestingly, during the 40s and 50s, the main form of supplemental Vitamin D was synthetic, created by ultraviolet irradiation of fungus. Research around 1970 claimed that this synthetic form might be responsible for the hardening of arteries in young people. Milk additives switched over to Vitamin D3 right after those articles came out.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned mushrooms exposed to light.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you gather them outside, just being exposed to daylight for a few hours is enough. There have been studies using mushroom powder as a Vitamin D supplement. It only took less than an ounce of powdered mushroom to make a distinct rise in serum levels. It actually depressed Vitamin D3 and increased Vitamin D2.

**Andrew Murray:** You have also been an advocate of mushroom soup for other reasons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, mainly for the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer functions.

## Vitamin D and Disease

**Andrew Murray:** Let's look at specific diseases. I don't know how many people are aware of the cancer association with Vitamin D, or TB, Multiple Sclerosis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Regarding fibromyalgia, I saw a theoretical mechanism linking it to Vitamin D. I know you associate that condition with hypothyroidism. How do you see fibromyalgia in terms of Vitamin D deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is parallel, almost identical, to the hypothyroid condition. All the inflammations you get with low thyroid function are structurally and functionally similar to those you get from a Vitamin D deficiency.

The Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is an agent of those inflammatory processes. TSH itself directly activates and causes tissue to release inflammatory cytokines and interleukins. Parathyroid hormone does that as well. By taking Vitamin D, increasing calcium intake, or decreasing phosphate relative to calcium, you will lower both TSH and parathyroid hormone. Both of these hormones are directly involved in mast cell activation—releasing histamine and serotonin—and increasing cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and nitric oxide, which promote degenerative inflammatory processes. Functionally, Vitamin D and thyroid are parallel. You can't quite separate them.

**Andrew Murray:** There are also papers on lung pathologies like tuberculosis improving with higher Vitamin D levels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just looking at people when they are brought into the hospital, the higher the Vitamin D when they come in, the more likely they are to go out alive. HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are very widespread conditions known to increase morbidity and mortality in proportion to how low the Vitamin D is.

**Andrew Murray:** I read about a compound called cathelicidin, an antiviral defense heightened by Vitamin D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the viral process is basically an energy process. When the cells are well-energized, they are resistant to infection and the replication of viruses. You can see the energy process in brain conditions associated with Vitamin D deficiency. Brain-injured patients have very low Vitamin D.

**Andrew Murray:** I read that Parkinson's was also implicated with low levels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the prion diseases are probably influenced because Vitamin D prevents the polymerization of the prion protein, which is involved in scrapie, Mad Cow Disease, Alzheimer's, and probably several other degenerative brain diseases. Anxiety and depression are also associated with very low Vitamin D.

## Liver, Kidneys, and Receptors

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the conversion of Vitamin D first in the liver and then in the kidneys to become active: Are you aware of anything that would bypass the necessity for healthy livers and kidneys to have adequate Vitamin D?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the low level of Vitamin D and calcium is probably the *cause* of the sick liver and kidneys, rather than being a product. Supplementing with calcium and Vitamin D will often correct the liver and kidney problem. It isn't a matter of curing the disease so they can activate Vitamin D; it's a matter of getting the Vitamin D and calcium into the system.

**Andrew Murray:** What about Vitamin D receptors? Is it reasonable to increase the amount of Vitamin D receptors your genotype expresses to overcome a shortfall?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The receptor is the problem. Some stress conditions make the receptor disappear. Getting enough calcium, Vitamin D, and good nutrition generally is necessary to make sure you aren't suppressing the receptors. Some receptor repression is done by over-methylation. If your mother was deficient in Vitamin D or calcium, that sets up a methylation pattern in offspring that can affect their sensitivity to Vitamin D.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know how long these receptors last?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know specifically, but other receptors typically turn over very fast so the cells can remain adaptable—usually just two or three days.

## Caller: Dosage and Weight Loss

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the air. Where are you from?

**Caller:** Phillipsville. A while back, I had a Vitamin D test and I was low. Later, I was on the low end of normal, and they suggested I take 5,000 units a day. I also take a multivitamin that has 3,000 units in it. If I take both, I'd be getting 8,000 a day. Is that too much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you figure that being in a bathing suit in the sun for 20 or 30 minutes—enough to just start turning pink—can make 10,000 or 15,000 units, then 5,000 or 10,000 units is never going to be harmful. I've never heard of 10,000 a day being harmful.

**Caller:** Did you say that you need added calcium for the Vitamin D to work better?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You need a good ratio of calcium to phosphate. I think it's really protective to take in well over 1,000 milligrams. I try to get about 2,500 milligrams of calcium per day.

**Caller:** What foods are good for that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk, cheese, and leafy greens that are well cooked.

**Caller:** They have to be cooked? I eat a lot of salad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We can't digest raw leaves, so most of the calcium is not being assimilated from salad greens. One or two big servings of kale or chard would give you a good part of your day's requirement. But I think the best way is to have more than a quart a day of low-fat milk.

**Caller:** I can't possibly drink a quart a day. I eat a little cheese and sour cream.

**Andrew Murray:** Can I ask how much you weigh?

**Caller:** I'm not going to tell you that.

**Andrew Murray:** It is important.

**Caller:** I'm a bit on the heavy side, let's say that.

**Andrew Murray:** There are very positive associations with an inability to absorb Vitamin D in obese people. Body fat has a suppressing effect on Vitamin D absorption.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D and calcium both have a direct suppressive effect on fat formation. The fatty liver, for example, is corrected by both Vitamin D and calcium in animal studies. A high calcium intake by itself, with a normal amount of Vitamin D, is very effective at preventing overweight.

**Caller:** What did you say would happen to the kidneys?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not enough calcium and Vitamin D, or too much phosphate—any of those will cause your parathyroid hormone to increase. Elevated phosphate and elevated parathyroid hormone are very toxic to the kidneys.

**Caller:** I had an overactive thyroid and had radioactive iodine to shrink it. Now I take 88 micrograms of thyroid a day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid works in many ways similarly to Vitamin D and regulates calcium and magnesium in particular.

## Caller: Urine Sediment

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller:** I am calling from Finland. I was wondering if you could enlighten me about sediment in the urine. Is this a good thing?

**Andrew Murray:** Is it a solid sediment or a cloudiness?

**Caller:** Like a dust, cloudy. If you let it sit, it would make a cloud. I heard claims from people eating mostly fruit that this might be a sign of good assimilation or kidney function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a fairly high protein intake and your urine is on the acid side—down around pH 5—and you have a very high calcium intake, say from the equivalent of 2 liters of milk per day, you will have a lot of calcium appearing in the urine. If the urine is acidic, it isn't likely to form stones. But when it stands, the pH can rise as the carbon dioxide evaporates, and that can precipitate crystals. Other things being equal, it isn't necessarily harmful to have precipitation in the urine.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think people with clear urine are healthier compared to those with opaque urine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think clarity is largely from the amount of fluid you are drinking. If the urine is acidic, I don't think some cloudiness is going to hurt. However, there can be bad causes of cloudiness, like infection. The yellow color of urine is considered to indicate cell turnover. Sometimes the morning urine will be yellow and the afternoon urine clear because, during the night with high stress hormones, a lot of cells are breaking down.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are almost out of time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wanted to mention that the Klotho protein we talked about a few months ago is the anti-aging protein. It is very similar to Vitamin D in some of its functions. A Vitamin D deficiency produces the degenerative changes that a mutation or deficiency of the Klotho protein can produce.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting. I really wanted to talk more about the Vitamin D receptor and how that could be enhanced. Maybe next month we can pick up the last part of Vitamin D and bring the receptor into more light. Thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium metabolism and sugar oxidation is another subject.

**Andrew Murray:** Excellent. Thanks for listening, and until next month, good night.
