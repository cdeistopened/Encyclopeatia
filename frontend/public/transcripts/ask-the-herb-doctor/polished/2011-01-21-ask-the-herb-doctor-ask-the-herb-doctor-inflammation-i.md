## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We’re in 2011. Happy New Year to you all. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

It's become increasingly obvious over the last few years that if you really want to get a point across, you cannot just mention it once or twice. Varied topics encompassing the same root subject will result in a coherent view of the matter in question. Association is an excellent tool for improving the memory. We get a lot of very positive feedback concerning Dr. Ray Peat, who has joined us on many of our shows. He is joining us tonight, and we'll discuss the role of inflammation in the disease process and reiterate some root causes and ways to avoid generating inflammation generally. Good evening, Dr. Peat, and thank you so much for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Hi, Dr. Peat. Sorry to interrupt, Andrew, but we need to give the disclaimer. The views and opinions expressed throughout this broadcast are our views and opinions, and they do not necessarily reflect the station's thoughts and ideas. Time will be made for other viewpoints.

**Andrew Murray:** Very good. So, to get back to Dr. Peat. For folks who have not listened to our show before, would you just go over your academic and professional career?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was a student and teacher in the humanities for about 10 or 15 years before I studied in the graduate school of biology—basically nerve biology and reproductive biology. I've taught a few courses in biochemistry, immunology, and other things.

## Defining Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** I know you've written fully referenced papers on many different topics. The topic for tonight's discussion is the role of inflammation on the human body: what it does, how it is generated, and how to do something about it. Would you briefly discuss what we all understand when we hear the word "inflammation," and then we'll go over the broad view of inflammation in newer thinking?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 50 years ago, when I was in school, they were teaching that inflammation is part of the curative healing process—we needed it to kill germs and heal. But in the last 10 or 20 years, the change has been seeing it occurring in all of the degenerative diseases: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease, arthritis, and so on. It was pretty abrupt in the 20th century that there was this sudden change to seeing inflammation as at least not all good, maybe all bad.

**Andrew Murray:** I know from reading about Plato and Aristotelian views of medicine that they had a different metaphor for understanding it. With the view of inflammation that Ilya Metchnikov brought around, would you describe the difference and how fundamentally it makes such a big difference to the way we should understand what causes it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Metchnikoff had worked primarily as an embryologist, understanding the organization of developing primitive organisms. When he saw the phagocyte process—when he put a splinter in an organism and saw cells gathering around it—he interpreted that in the context of what he knew best, which was how the organisms create and maintain their body structure.

The Nobel Prize went simultaneously to him, with that very biological view of immunity, and to Ehrlich, who was working with chemical poisons. The idea of immunity as killing "bad organisms" took over throughout the United States and most of the world for most of the 20th century. As Americans started studying the white blood cells and the thymus gland, they were influenced by the drug industry—Ehrlich looking for the "magic bullets" to kill the evil organisms. That passed over to thinking about antibodies and cells as aimed primarily at organisms that are trying to take over.

## Retroviruses and Hepatitis C

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It reminds me of how you've described the progression of hepatitis C. We're told that it's this nasty bug, but maybe it's just the body trying to rearrange something, and there's an inflammation process going on from damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the retroviruses in general—we've got lots of them, and they seem to be as much part of us as anything. They don't do anything that is for sure harmful. If you mess up an organ, like poison the liver, you get a bunch of these retroviruses. They call them "retro" because normally DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein, but there are enzymes which will turn RNA into DNA. That was first observed in 1979.

At that time, Lamarck had been totally weeded out in the late 1940s with the Cold War. All of Lamarck's followers were fired from teaching positions in the U.S. So in 1979, when the idea that information could go from RNA to DNA was demonstrated, my professors unanimously said it's impossible; that's Lamarckian and not permitted.

**Andrew Murray:** Just so people understand: DNA codes for the manufacture of proteins, and RNA is the messenger. If the retroviruses can manufacture DNA, that DNA can then get into our mitochondria or effect a change in its own right.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the people inclined in the direction of Lamarck, like Barbara McClintock, proposed that you can get genetic change. Eventually, Barbara McClintock got the Nobel Prize for it—about 40 years too late—demonstrating that information can flow from the environment into the DNA. Some of these people were actually saying that there should be enzymes, such as are seen in retroviruses, that can create new DNA in response to environmental experience.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That reminds me about that test in Egypt regarding schistosomiasis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there was a chronic schistosomiasis epidemic where a very high percentage of Egyptians had it. They were treated with chemicals that injured their liver. Now they say that it was caused by spreading a virus, but other experiments suggest that the chemical treatment aimed at killing this parasite could have been enough to cause the livers to express retroviruses, one of which is now called hepatitis C.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's looking at the disease as a damaged particle rather than an infectious organism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think this is what Peter Duesberg is suggesting when he says that the retrovirus of HIV, for example, isn't known to be a cause of immunodeficiency. He suggests that it's the result of chemical poisoning.

## Inflammation vs. Fetal Healing

**Andrew Murray:** Back to the inflammatory process. How does the newer view describe inflammation and how does it differ from what we learned in school?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the injury of the fetus, it heals without inflammation and it doesn't produce a scar. Basically, it's perfect healing. At a very early stage, you can split the embryo and each part will grow into a complete animal. Later in development, you can cut or injure a part of the fetus and it simply zips itself shut, makes new cells, and doesn't leave a scar or inflammation. It's after being born that inflammation as we know it occurs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We all need to crawl back into our mother's womb.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two things that happen when we're born. One is our carbon dioxide exposure goes way down and the oxygen availability increases greatly. So there is a shift away from carbon dioxide, which is anti-inflammatory. At the same time, we are no longer protected by the uterus and placenta, which act as a filter and let very little polyunsaturated fat in. Practically all newborns are considered deficient in the so-called "essential fatty acids." But these begin building up during childhood from practically any diet. That, combined with the reduced availability of carbon dioxide, accounts for basically all of the features of inflammation and degeneration that are distinct from the prenatal healing process.

We still have some of the features of prenatal healing, and they can be recovered to some extent. For example, if you pack a wound with sugar, it practically heals without a scar. That's partly because it is giving an extremely generous supply of sugar which can be used to make carbon dioxide.

**Andrew Murray:** This is behind the Greeks using honey in deep wounds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The sugar makes it unnecessary for the cells to metabolize any of the fatty acids. Even if the organism has been eating them and integrating them into the tissues, the presence of sugar makes it possible to energize and repair cells without drawing down more of these unsaturated fats, which produce all of the features we know of as inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to summarize: polyunsaturated fats are liquid vegetable oils present in almost everybody's diet. You can avoid them to some extent by avoiding any liquid vegetable oil apart from olive oil, and eating coconut oil and butter in their place.

## Endotoxins and Stress

**Andrew Murray:** If people started to increase their carbon dioxide content—we've mentioned bag breathing or living at elevation—and cutting out polyunsaturated fatty acids, what else could be done to lessen the chance of inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another basic thing promoting inflammation is the endotoxin from bacteria that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. If your liver is well nourished and energized, it can cut out practically 100% of the endotoxin. But if the intestine is stressed in any way—which can be nervous stress increasing adrenaline—that cuts down the blood supply. The reduced blood supply releases histamine and serotonin, which make the intestine more permeable, letting more of the endotoxin get into the bloodstream. The endotoxin does the same thing throughout the body: it increases permeability, lowers energy, and increases the inefficiency that shows up as inflammation (swelling, redness, heat).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So stress is a big killer. A lot of people who get extremely stressed are often running on adrenaline to keep their metabolism up rather than running on an adequate amount of thyroid. Dr. Peat, do you have anything else to add to how we can help minimize stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping the intestine as clean as possible and moving stuff along. Raw carrots or bamboo shoots happen to be antiseptic vegetable material that doesn't feed the bacteria and tends to suppress bacterial growth so it doesn't come too far up the intestine. They also bind the endotoxin and other chemicals that should be eliminated.

If the intestine is sluggish, what the liver has excreted into the bile will be reabsorbed farther down the intestine and come back to poison the liver. If you keep a stream of good clean material moving through, you can lower the toxins that should be excreted. That would include unwanted hormones, including estrogen, which the liver should be able to eliminate 100%. It will reduce the endotoxin and shift the serotonin and histamine such that it will also lower cortisol production. That total pattern will increase the good hormones, like progesterone and testosterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For a nice recipe: if you add apple cider vinegar or lemon/lime juice to raw grated carrots with some salt and coconut oil or olive oil, it's even more antimicrobial and antifungal.

## Anti-Inflammatory Substances

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about using anti-inflammatories as another means to lower inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of them are very helpful. I mentioned that cleaning the intestine will lower cortisol and raise pregnenolone, testosterone, and progesterone. These are our natural, most powerful anti-inflammatory things. The fetus is exposed to extremely high concentrations of progesterone until it's born. Keeping our production of progesterone as high as possible can make a big difference. Aspirin and related things are also helpful. A lot of fruit chemicals are similar to aspirin and have a protective effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What particular fruit chemicals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm specifically thinking of naringenin in oranges.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that in grapefruit as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's another one in grapefruit that happens to poison an enzyme system in the liver, letting estrogen accumulate tremendously.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This is such a well-known medical fact that in the Fortuna maternity ward, they say they no longer serve grapefruit juice to pregnant mothers because it interferes with the hormones. They didn't specify that it blocked the P450 enzyme that helps the liver excrete excess estrogen.

## Longevity and Diet

**Andrew Murray:** Have they done animal experiments modeling high CO2 and keeping inflammatory products out to see how long they lived?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 70 years ago, people noticed that food restriction could increase lifespan by 30% or 40%. It has gone through phases where they saw this could happen even in adult animals. Then they started trying different specific foods. It happens that the foods which are eliminated are those which produce inflammation, such as polyunsaturated fats and the amino acids that contribute to inflammation, like tryptophan and methionine. Just eliminating one of these increased longevity by about 30% or 40% in animal studies.

## Water and Altitude

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So these Indians that live to 120 years of age in the Andes, are they just not eating any polyunsaturated oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of these long-lived cultures in South America, the Caucasus, and Nepal lived at fairly high altitudes and were surrounded by glaciers. They were drinking water that was fairly recently high-altitude snow, which happens to be isotopically different from sea level water. It's been refined by repeated distillation. As it rains out going to higher altitudes, it becomes metabolically stimulating "light water," whereas average water contains some of the metabolically slowing "heavy water."

At the same time, the atmosphere at high altitudes is very low in oxygen, so people retain more carbon dioxide in their tissues—another resemblance to the prenatal condition. Generally, they are sheep farmers, so they tend to eat vegetables, fruits, and lots of cheese and milk-related dishes.

**Andrew Murray:** The thing about the rainwater is interesting. From an alchemical perspective, the first prerequisite is to distill water seven times to raise the energy of the water. I read an article about water and how different it is energetically and how available it is to the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, when they first made isotopically heavy water with deuterium replacing hydrogen, they found that it slowed biological processes like nerve conduction. In 1950, they showed in mouse experiments that it tremendously accelerated the aging process. It took about 50 years before people started experimenting with the light water from which the heavy water had been removed. They experimented with it in Russian space vehicles and found that the condensed sweat, which had been filtered, was a very light water resembling glacier water.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So what water do you recommend people drink?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to go near a glacier. However, some plants will absorb the water at high altitudes and concentrate it even more. Sugar beets, for example, intrinsically eliminate deuterons. So they have light hydrogen incorporated into their tissues. If they grow in Colorado at a high altitude where they're getting already refined water, then the beet sugar contains the equivalent of glacier water.

## Cell Communication

**Andrew Murray:** The main thing in our bodies is that everything communicates properly. When things don't communicate properly, problems occur. What do you think about cell-to-cell communication?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it works on many different levels, but the important one has been sketched out by people like Albert Szent-Györgyi, who demonstrated that cells, muscle systems, and secretory systems are tuned electronically. The whole cell is tuned to resonate to certain substances. There's a recent lecture by Luca Turin on pharmacology showing the current vitality of that idea. Mae-Wan Ho has a website talking about the coherence of an organism, showing a worm under a polarizing microscope with coherence on the atomic level all the way through. I think that kind of coherence—electronic or chemical and electrical interaction—is at the basis of cell recognition.

## Caller: Prozac Withdrawal

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line. Paula, you're on the air.

**Caller (Paula):** I have a question for Dr. Peat. I've been getting off of Prozac that I took for many years, and I'm having discontinuation syndrome—agitation, sweating, and so on. Are there herbs that one can take to help alleviate that discomfort? I was worried about the influence of these serotonin uptake inhibitors on my bone structure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The good effects of those serotonin uptake inhibitors, I think, are due to other things, not at all serotonin. It's in spite of the serotonin. In the 1950s, serotonin was discovered to be what makes the carcinoid tumor so bad. These tumors turn the bulk of dietary tryptophan into serotonin. The features of this massive overdosing of serotonin give insight into the drug industry: people flushed, became depressed, anxious, and aggressive. They developed arthritic pains, skin thickening, and fibrotic heart valves. These are things now being seen associated with the uptake inhibitors: osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, obesity.

**Caller (Paula):** Here serotonin is the supposed good guy, but getting off of it is really awful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are good ways to get off. I think pregnenolone, thyroid, and coffee are very helpful.

**Caller (Paula):** Coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, you have to adjust to the coffee, but it goes with thyroid, sugar, progesterone, and so on as part of an anti-inflammatory system. When we were talking about anti-inflammatory substances, I should have mentioned caffeine as one of them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, if you're already running on a lot of adrenaline and have low blood sugar, caffeine can worsen symptoms. But if you restock your liver's glycogen stores through eating sugars that are lower glycemic index—specifically non-starchy sugars—your body will not respond to the adrenaline like it would if you have low blood sugar.

## Arnica and Bruising

**Andrew Murray:** Someone had a question about arnica: how it works and how to use it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Arnica is a very anti-inflammatory flower. You want to make a macerated oil from *Arnica montana*. You don't want to take it internally, but rubbing the oil on the affected area immediately after an injury can really help alleviate bruises, tendon sprains, and tears.

**Andrew Murray:** It works really well. Dr. Peat, do you understand the physiological effect of arnica?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know.

## Cell Communication (Continued)

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you about the study you mentioned where cells communicate even through a piece of plastic or quartz.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was Gurwitsch in the 1920s and 30s. They demonstrated that if you used quartz, which passes certain frequencies of ultraviolet, cells could stimulate cell division across the thin sheet of quartz. That is being taken up again in the last 10 years. Most of the work is in the ultraviolet frequency of communication.

**Andrew Murray:** The main thing is that everything communicates properly. That communication is benefited by higher energy, which is the function of the thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, carbon dioxide is sort of a universal hormone of metabolism, keeping everything in the optimal condition. For example, it holds histamine and serotonin in a bound position. It holds calcium in a bound position. If you hyperventilate and lower your CO2, within a minute your platelets—which carry most of the serotonin—will release it and immediately cause capillaries to become permeable, leaking fluid into your lungs. You can create pulmonary edema with a minute of hyperventilation just because you've messed up the carbon dioxide concentration.

## Retroviruses and Antibodies

**Andrew Murray:** Back to retroviruses. Are you saying that ultimately we coexist with a wide range of retroviruses, none of which normally give us any problem until some other insult?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, Duesberg said we all contain hundreds of them. When there's an injury to the tissue, we do form antibodies. Some people say that's evidence that they're an alien thing. But many years ago, someone did an experiment with rabbit cartilage. If they removed a piece of cartilage and put it back untampered, it didn't produce any reaction. But if they twisted the cartilage just enough to damage the structure, the rabbit produced antibodies to it. What that means is that antibodies are part of a cleanup process. Something is disturbed, and the antibodies prepare the situation for our phagocytes to remove the damaged material.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we're looking at the immune system not as a killer attack system, but as a house cleaner.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just fairly recently, someone showed that in a traumatic brain injury, the presence of antibodies to the injured tissue corresponds to the healing. The absence of the antibodies lets the tissue deteriorate. In the thyroid, people think about autoimmune antibodies as causing the problem. But just an excess of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) causes overstimulation and inflammation. The body is cleaning up the damaged cells when it produces antibodies. If you keep the TSH low enough, the cleanup will proceed and the antibodies will disappear.

## Caller: Eczema and Psoriasis

**Andrew Murray:** We have another caller.

**Caller:** I'm interested in your thoughts on eczema in relationship to leaky gut.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Celiac disease is one of the causes of both skin disease and arthritis. Celiac disease will allow endotoxin into your circulation. Low thyroid is probably the most common thing associated with ordinary eczema. When your thyroid is low, the circulation in your intestine is poor, serotonin is high, and the combination of endotoxin and serotonin will cause the skin to have abnormal growth patterns.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would psoriasis be in the same category?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why when people take liver herbs like dandelion and burdock, they notice an improvement. Working on the digestive tract makes a big difference.

## Gluten and Bread

**Caller:** In relationship to celiac disease, do you think the tests for gluten allergies are accurate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They can clearly demonstrate the enzymes involved, but I think gluten is toxic in itself to anyone. It's just that some people are more resistant. It has an overlap with the transglutaminase enzyme, which is activated by estrogen. I think that's why women have more of the problem with it.

Gluten is not intended as a food. The seeds create the protein gluten as a storage form, but also to discourage animals from eating it because it contains amino acids that contribute to inflammation. The seed intends it to cause inflammation in your intestine. A very tough person can withstand it for a long time, but it's not a good idea for anyone to eat it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Traditionally, Europeans ate bread, but it was always soured. The souring process changes the gluten into a less allergenic form.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And soaking it for 12 hours or so increases the protein value tremendously while destroying the gluten.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Modern sourdough bread is risen in three or four hours, maybe even 20 minutes. That's not enough time for the cultures to break down the gluten.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are coming to the end of the show. Thank you so much again for joining us, Dr. Peat, and sharing all of your knowledge. Dr. Raymond Peat has a very good website with an extensive list of reference material on many different subjects, from thyroid to progesterone to fish oil. His website is www.raypeat.com.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you and good night. Happy New Year.
