## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, we talk about a wide range of topics related to health, alternative health, and uncovering some of the lies. That is part of this evening's program.

This month I wanted to go over subjects, some of which we have covered, but I can't emphasize enough the indoctrination that I have been through in medical education. It is very difficult to unlearn. It is far better if you are going to get educated in real medicine and science that you get your facts right the first time around. I know Dr. Peat, when he was studying, had to overcome quite a lot of that bias while he was doing his Ph.D.

I wanted to start off the show with a paragraph that I've written to introduce the subject. There is such a complex web of ignorance, bias, and deceit woven into medicine, its practice, and evaluation. From peer-pressured, competitive education through to the brutal and exhausting residencies, it is the perfect breeding ground for the lack of questioning scientific inquiry and acceptance of the status quo. It is no wonder progress has been slow and that the previously rational, objective principles which it once stood on have now given way to marketing and designer drugs for ever-increasing diagnoses. Couple this with a biological understanding that is no longer holistic, and it's a perfect storm.

Over the last 10 years of doing these interviews with Dr. Peat, time and time again, what I thought was grounded in science has been far from it. It is the reality of "buyer beware." Do your own research, question, and search. Don't just take your doctor's word for it. They are under pressure to perform within standard medical protocols, not thinking outside the box, as this is a surefire way to lose your license for malpractice.

So, how did we get to this point where it was initially "first do no harm," and now iatrogenic death or disease is commonplace? Before we take a look at some examples in which stunning misconceptions are rapidly repeated as truth, let me introduce Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. Would you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was a school teacher in several different subjects. I first taught college introductory physics for biology majors, along with several other courses including art theory and introduction to computers. Then I was mostly teaching English and humanities-related subjects before I went back to get a degree in biology at the University of Oregon in 1968.

I did my dissertation on reproductive physiology—specifically, age-related processes in the uterus and how aging changes the respiratory mechanism of the reproductive system. Since then, I've just been continuing to work on everything between the brain and the reproductive system related to biology.

## Academic Bias and Indoctrination

**Andrew Murray:** Whilst you were going through your education, you probably came across research papers suggesting quite the opposite of what was being pushed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For example, my thesis professor, Soderwall, asked me how my work was going. I said it was looking like the older animals had more intense respiration in their uterus, which would be the same as increased estrogen. He said, "Oh, that's interesting, carry on." Other professors would have said, "Wait, that's contrary to the textbook. Stop and do something else." In fact, I watched professors in other departments say, "Oh, you have to find something that is going to be consistent with our project here."

**Andrew Murray:** How often was that the case where you'd come up with evidence to the contrary?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In this department, Soderwall was on the female reproductive physiology side. He accepted anything we came up with. But even on the male reproductive side, there were old fogey professors that insisted on not departing from the textbook.

**Andrew Murray:** In terms of maintaining their egos and all the hard work they did to get where they were?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the reason for that was that female reproductive physiology was low rank on the totem pole of sciences.

**Andrew Murray:** You've repeated the quote that "a lie spreads around the world faster than truth can get its shoelaces tied." When this lie is promulgated by Big Pharma, advertising, the FDA, and the government, there is little opposition.

Since Sarah and I have been working with you, I've seen definite positive changes in applying the science you talk about—using progesterone, pregnenolone, thyroid, and aspirin as energy-saving, anti-estrogenic substances. These things have flown in the face of everything I was taught.

## The Serotonin Myth

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to visit the question of serotonin and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) again. We are told serotonin is the "happy hormone." Could you explain what we are told versus what you understand about its activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have looked at that recently on some of the best-known medical websites, and they are still basically saying the same thing. No one has looked at the critical information in a very public spot.

When serotonin was identified chemically in the body, it was seen to constrict smooth muscles—first the intestine, then blood vessels and the uterus. Then it was discovered to exist in the brain. Up into the mid-to-late 60s, people were still looking at the actual research. They saw that things like the ergot family—LSD and related substances—were able to block it and prevent the actions of constricting muscles in all of the known tissues.

**Andrew Murray:** By blocking serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The main nerves that produce serotonin are just turned off by LSD and psilocybin. But as that was becoming known in the 1960s, the government was also starting to criminalize psychedelic chemicals, which were in the news repeatedly as anti-serotonin agents.

When the government criminalized these, the drug companies saw that they could form the basis of drug products. It was in their interest to say that those evil, illegal drugs are anti-serotonin and naturally make you insane, because the "good stuff" which makes you sane is serotonin. That created a foundation of public opinion to build the whole myth on. The government has been creating political myths, and the chemical companies use the government to support their economic sales myths.

**Andrew Murray:** To protect the companies, no doubt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The companies are supposedly defending the healthy, sane parts of the organism, and the psychedelic people are threatening the sanity of the population. That implies that if you go crazy when you take an anti-serotonin agent, then what you need is products to *increase* your serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you know about the harmful effects of serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Animal research has the advantage that they can take fluids from anywhere in the animal or grind up its brain to see what is actually there. If you stress an animal—injure it, suffocate it—you will increase the stress hormones: cortisol, estrogen, and serotonin. Chronic stress increases serotonin in the brain as well as several other tissues.

If you compare an average lab animal to one that has been tortured, or one which has been put in a big vacation space with entertaining things to do, the one that is suffering will have high cortisol and lower adrenaline. Cortisol is driven up by the corticotropin-releasing hormone, which is activated primarily by serotonin. So, in these miserable animals, their serotonin is higher.

The happiest animals have the lowest serotonin, as well as lower acetylcholine and generally a little higher adrenaline. They are very alert, learn very well, and have very low serotonin. If you give these exactly the same chemicals that you are giving to increasingly young kids—if you give SSRIs to adolescent hamsters, for example—they become vicious and aggressive.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you understand the mechanism by which increased serotonin causes aggression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think anyone does fully. But in general, you can suppress the aggression by giving them hopeless kind of stress. The "hopeless, helpless" stress seems to be put into effect by serotonin. Anti-serotonin drugs are starting to be used as antidepressants, but they have been used to cure learned helplessness.

**Andrew Murray:** That is it in a nutshell. Anti-serotonin drugs are being used.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 35 or 40 years ago, a psychiatrist named Cloninger was defining personality types and relating people to animal studies. He proposed that higher serotonin promoted a personality type of "harm avoidance." Rather than creative activity, the animals figured out different ways to avoid being hurt. They were fearful and anxious.

**Andrew Murray:** Isn't suicide increased as part of the disclaimer literature in SSRIs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Looking at the brains of people who commit suicide, they have found several different kinds of support for the idea that they were suffering from excess serotonin production. 50 years after he and his partner defined the famous experiments for learned helplessness, the researchers revised their theory and decided that in humans, too, it is caused by increased serotonin. Originally, they had suggested it might be the loss of serotonin, but they have changed their minds now.

**Andrew Murray:** Yet we are still brainwashed into thinking serotonin and melatonin are just happy chemicals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Especially when the people who really defined the context for current discussion have changed their minds.

## MAOIs and Dopamine

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to talk about Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs). Monoamine oxidase breaks down serotonin, and MAOIs prevent that breakdown to increase serotonin. They are also marketed for improving other monoamines like dopamine and norepinephrine. What do you think about low levels of these other monoamines in depression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When they all come up together, things tend to stay more in balance. When you have adrenaline, dopamine, and acetylcholine all coming up at the same time.

**Andrew Murray:** Wouldn't you suggest that anti-serotonin drugs would be useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Interestingly, they are being used for all of the things now known to be promoted by serotonin. There are anti-serotonin products starting to be studied and recommended against cancer, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, depression, psychosis, and lung disease especially.

**Andrew Murray:** I wonder how we go three or four decades under this complete farce while people suffer or die. It seems there is a historical rule that every stupid medical idea lasts about 50 years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Listener Q&A: Psilocybin

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** A local caller got it in five words: How does psilocybin fit in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think psilocybin works very similarly to LSD in suppressing the serotonin nerves. Some of the others, like amphetamine derivatives, have a little overlap. I don't know that much about mescaline, but it doesn't work exactly on those same nerves.

**Andrew Murray:** All the initial research into LSD and psilocybin was probably going in a pretty good direction until it was scuppered by the serotonin industry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were seeing good results in treating alcoholism, depression, and a lot of psychiatric things.

## The Biological Function of Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** Is there any instance where you think serotonin is useful? We produce it ourselves, so it must have some activity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the place it operates is so at the heart of things that it's best to let it develop under its own rules. For example, tryptophan, which is turned into serotonin, has a resonant aromatic electron system which is very responsive to light, electromagnetic energy, and oxidation-reduction. This is in practically all proteins. It is sort of like the nerve center of each protein molecule.

The structure of most cells is built on a framework of filaments and tubes—microtubules—that give the cell stiffness and movement. These are increasingly thought to be electronically or reductively interactive, acting like the nerve system of the cell. Serotonin acts on these responsive proteins and microtubules with a special interaction. Serotonin can stop the polymerization of the microstructure of a cell, interrupting it so that it can start de-differentiating and getting ready to divide.

When something is so basic to the existence of a cell, I think it's the worst thing you can do to try to intervene by giving a pill to someone. It's like if you have an electric motor, trying to pour coal into it for fuel.

## Listener Q&A: Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Caller:** I'm from New York. I was physically active, then got swelling on my ankle. The doctor diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). It looks like hundreds of conditions are called RA, and they treat everybody with steroids. My case seems less severe compared to others. Does Dr. Peat have any ideas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen several people—seems like every couple of years I run across one—where their doctors have told them they are incurable. But I think if you find out what's causing it, sometimes you discover that maybe you didn't have that diagnosis in the first place. Foods you are eating, supplements you are taking, or especially if you are taking a serotonin or estrogen drug—those are enough to bring it on.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you believe in the inflammatory process mediating swollen joints and the presence of rheumatoid factor as a differential diagnosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. It will go away if you don't have it anymore. Same with lupus. Another person with lupus recently stopped thinking she had lupus, corrected her diet, took vitamin D and thyroid, and recovered.

**Andrew Murray:** From an herbal perspective, supporting excretion and the liver is key. Basic things like celery seed and devil's claw act as anti-inflammatories, and waste clearing products like burdock or yellow dock aid bile production.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just avoiding some of the foods that have been causing intestinal inflammation is the first thing to look for. Using a regular fibrous food in the diet sometimes is enough to tremendously reduce inflammation.

## Listener Q&A: Heart Attack Diagnosis

**Caller:** I'm from the Bay Area. My dad was at high altitude, experienced shortness of breath, coughing blood, and fatigue. The hospital diagnosed a heart attack based on blood work. A day later, after a CT scan, they said it was just pneumonia. How can you diagnose cardiovascular disease safely without resorting to a CT scan or angiogram?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing a person notices is trouble doing their usual energetic activities.

**Andrew Murray:** How reliable do you think enzymes are as a marker for heart attacks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Somewhat, but I wouldn't trust them in myself. Stress and exertion can damage a muscle—like running too far—and release enzymes. If your energy supply is low, if you're hypoglycemic and running on fat, overexertion can damage any muscle, including the heart.

**Andrew Murray:** What about angiograms and the dyes used?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you're not sure your heart has been injured, getting a chemical injected into your heart—especially if you exercise with that chemical in there—is going to irritate things and cause some damage. It isn't an entirely free and safe thing to do.

For about 30 or 40 years now, there has been a treatment called "GIK" or "Polarizing Solution"—standing for Glucose, Insulin, and Potassium (often with Magnesium). They give this to someone at the very beginning of a heart attack. It accelerates the healing of the heart. The glucose and insulin lower the free fatty acids, which are a major damaging factor in a heart attack. The insulin helps the cells take up the potassium and magnesium they need to restore energy.

**Andrew Murray:** In Germany, they have published papers supporting hawthorn extract. If administered within 12 hours of a myocardial infarct, it significantly decreases ischemic damage.

## Listener Q&A: Antipsychotics

**Caller:** My father battled mental health issues and took Haldol and Thorazine. Was the action of those antipsychotics similar to the antidepressant action you were speaking of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have the impression that Haldol was a danger to that system. I'm not sure about Thorazine. I think the main problem with that was it was given in such large amounts that people lost functioning. It mostly just quieted people down.

## Listener Q&A: Location and Health

**Caller:** I'm from Utah. Dr. Peat, why do you choose to live in Oregon as opposed to someplace like New Mexico with sun and high elevation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely not for health. It was the location of the University of Oregon Library. I lived close enough that I could walk to the library regularly. In Los Angeles, for example, there was no way to get to a big library simply.

## Listener Q&A: Diabetes Diet

**Caller:** I'm from Arcata. I'd like a pep talk on skillful eating for diabetics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoiding serotonin-promoting drugs is one thing, because that's a factor in creating diabetes.

My experience started with my father having a diagnosis of extreme diabetes. He cured himself primarily with brewer's yeast. That got me interested. I read that in 19th-century England and France, doctors cured mortally sick diabetics by letting them eat as much sugar as they wanted—almost a pound a day. Instead of dying, the conversion of protein to sugar decreased and finally stopped, and they recovered.

They had broken the pattern of stress by letting them follow their appetites. Sugar promotes the regeneration of the beta cells that make insulin. It is the free fatty acids which are killing the beta cells constantly.

**Andrew Murray:** Because if you don't have enough sugar, you break your muscle tissue down and generate free fatty acids in an attempt to raise glucose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is animal research that explains it, but doctors don't want to listen to that.

## Listener Q&A: Thyroid and Environment

**Caller:** Besides altitude, are there other characteristics of a location that affect thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoiding very long winters is important because of the stress of the long nights. But I think altitude is very important because the high oxygen pressure at sea level is constantly creating stress—a random tendency to oxidize fats spontaneously—which disappears at a higher altitude. When you find the right altitude for your adaptation, you're able to retain the right amount of carbon dioxide so that oxidative processes run more smoothly without stress.

## Final Question: Acetaminophen

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Does acetaminophen impact steroid production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nothing that occurs to me right now, but through damage to your liver, it undoubtedly will.

**Andrew Murray:** Undoubtedly. Thank you very much again, Dr. Peat, for giving your time. For those listening, Dr. Peat's website is www.raypeat.com. He has lots of fully referenced scientific articles there. Thank you for listening.
