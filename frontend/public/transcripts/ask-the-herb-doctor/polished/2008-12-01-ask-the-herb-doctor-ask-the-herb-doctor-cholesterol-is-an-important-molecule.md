## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD 91.1 FM. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists with degrees in herbal medicine. We consult clients with a wide range of conditions and operate a certified organic medicinal herb farm. This month, we are pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat on the show. Dr. Peat, for those who don't know you, could you give our listeners an overview of your professional and research-based work before we open up tonight's topics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I did my PhD research in aging of the oxidative respiratory systems and how that is affected mostly by reproductive hormones. I looked at how it causes, for example, middle-aged infertility in people and animals. What I found, which was contrary to the textbooks at the time, was that estrogen became the dominant hormone at middle age, causing distortion of the oxidative metabolic processes.

That got me interested in the factors that contribute to that age-related imbalance. Age pigment was one of the things I studied in connection with that change. Age pigment itself is stimulated by an excess of estrogen and is formed mostly from polyunsaturated oils. It oxidizes fuel and consumes oxygen without producing anything useful except free radicals. I later found that the way to prevent or delay that was to protect the thyroid hormone function. In the years since then, I've worked on ways to use diet to decrease the formation of age pigment, retard the increase in estrogen in the tissues, and maintain optimal thyroid function.

## Cholesterol Myths and Standards

**Andrew Murray:** I know you are keen to emphasize the nutritional side of a lifestyle rather than simply prescribing drugs or herbal supplements. In relation to diet, high cholesterol is a touchy subject given that statin drugs have been implicated in causing severe side effects. What is your opinion about the cause of high cholesterol? How high do you consider "high," and how would you approach its treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a study a few years ago of women in rest homes or convalescent hospitals. They followed them from the time they entered until they died, watching how their cholesterol levels corresponded to their longevity and ability to function. The optimal cholesterol level for living a long time and keeping their mentality sound was 270 mg/dL.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wow. Current laboratories and doctors recommend that it should be under 200.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a Framingham study about 20 years ago which looked at the cholesterol levels of people as they passed the age of 50 in ordinary life situations. They saw that those who did *not* have a cholesterol level above 200 were more likely to become demented.

It has been known for 80 or 90 years that cholesterol is an antitoxin, an anti-inflammatory, and our basic protective substance. It is like a protective hormone in itself. In experiments with animals, learning ability and maze-running ability improve just by increasing the amount of cholesterol. Cell division involves cholesterol. It stabilizes red blood cells. Every level of physiology is protected by adequate cholesterol.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is it true that every one of our cells utilizes cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even the genetic apparatus. Cholesterol is an essential component of every living process. It is stuck to the chromosomes and the structural, architectural microtubules and microfilaments all through the cell. It isn't just a membrane-associated thing. The ability of cells to move requires cholesterol.

**Andrew Murray:** Why does modern mainstream medicine consider a figure over 200 to be associated with a higher incidence of cerebrovascular disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's similar to why the optimal level of blood pressure has been revised downward. They can treat more patients and sell more drugs if more of the population is defined as sick. Thirty or 40 years ago, there was a study looking at blood pressure with aging; those whose pressure kept rising with the years lived the longest. A decrease in blood pressure indicated the nearness of death. As long as the blood pressure was on a steady rise, that was a good indicator.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What values do you consider healthy and normal for blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The lower number is partly an indicator of the elasticity of the system—how much pressure is there when the heart isn't beating. If the system is elastic, the lower number usually approaches 80. The upper number should be less than 50 points higher than that. So, 120 over 80—with a 40-point difference—is very good. A good plumbing engineer knows that keeping the pressure steady without great rises and falls makes the water circulate more smoothly. You don't want the lower number to drop too low, otherwise the blood stops moving.

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to cholesterol, is the acceptable value of 270 more for elderly people, or would this apply to younger people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is for old people. Similar to blood pressure, cholesterol rises when there is a problem to be soothed. When tissues are less efficient, they need more blood supply and care. So, blood pressure and cholesterol tend to rise with aging as the tissues need more attention.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you consider it dangerous for doctors to prescribe statins to older people when their bodies need higher cholesterol for protection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Back in the mid-80s in Hungary, there was a large study which saw that using a drug to lower cholesterol increased the death rate from just about every cause. Cancer, suicide, and even getting murdered were more probable when a person had their cholesterol artificially lowered.

## Cholesterol as a Precursor to Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** Could you cover what cholesterol is responsible for helping us with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the main defensive substance, but it is in turn converted into other protective substances. The first of which are pregnenolone and progesterone, and also DHEA. It should be massively converted into those more specific protective substances, but it can only be converted when the thyroid is adequate.

**Andrew Murray:** Please explain that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In experiments where they put the bloodstream flowing into an organ like an ovary or an adrenal gland, if the blood contains Vitamin A and thyroid hormone, the amount of progesterone being produced by the gland varies directly with the amount of cholesterol going into the gland. It is a massive quantitative conversion.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if you have low blood cholesterol, you will have low production of progesterone coming from that ovary?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. That's why it's dangerous to have it artificially lowered; it is the raw material for making all of the very specific protective steroids.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this why dementia is higher in low-cholesterol clients? Because these protective hormones are not being manufactured in sufficient amounts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There are several lines of reasoning showing that progesterone, for example, is extremely protective to the brain. It promotes healing and regeneration after the brain has been injured. It is now being tested in people who have had car accidents with brain damage, and it makes a tremendous difference in survival and recovery rates. If your cholesterol is artificially lowered, your brain is going to be deficient in progesterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, progesterone is very important for anti-aging and keeping normal cellular processes going. If we don't have enough cholesterol coming from our diet or synthesis, we will likely have low levels of these protective hormones.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and thyroid has to be present for that conversion to take place. As early as 1993, it was found that in cholesterol treatment of rabbits—which caused circulatory disease—if they gave the same amount of cholesterol along with thyroid hormone, it didn't hurt their circulatory system.

Furthermore, the experimental cholesterol treatments turned out to be using a toxic form of oxidized cholesterol. If you leave cholesterol sitting in a bottle too long, or use certain cooking practices, it creates this toxic form. For example, people recommend steaming salmon to cook it at a lower temperature, but the slow oxygen exposure to unsaturated fats actually increases the toxic oxidized cholesterol. Steamed salmon has more toxic cholesterol than a grilled beef steak.

## Vegetable Oils and Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA)

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when they slice open someone's arteries and see cholesterol blocking them, what is happening?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cholesterol is there primarily to protect the cells against the free radicals produced by the polyunsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For our listeners, polyunsaturated fats come from vegetable oils including soy, corn, safflower, sunflower, fish oil, canola, and cottonseed. Are you saying those oils are so toxic to the lining of our arteries that they cause a breakdown, which the body then tries to patch with cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that was worked out in the 1940s. Lab animals were dying of various symptoms, including infertility and softening of the brain. It was found that this was because they were adding unsaturated vegetable oils to their feed. It turned out that the oils were blocking their thyroid function and preventing them from using the protective cholesterol.

Agriculture took advantage of the anti-thyroid effect of these vegetable oils to use them to fatten animals economically.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So instead of pigs being fed compost, they were fed corn and soy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It was common to use waste food like spoiling apples, vegetables, and whey. But when they learned they could fatten pigs on much less food if it contained these unsaturated oils, that became the basic industrial animal food.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It makes sense because these vegetable oils aren't something we've naturally been eating in such concentrated forms for thousands of years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Mark Twain's time, he wrote about hearing merchants talking about how cheap cottonseed oil was and that they were going to teach Americans to eat that instead of butter. That was in the 1880s.

## Diabetes, Sugar, and Starch

**Andrew Murray:** I believe this is linked to thyroid as well, but diabetes seems to have exploded in terms of diagnoses. What can be done to treat that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The diet of Americans and Europeans has changed over the years in which diabetes has increased, specifically with the greatly increased consumption of polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Even eggs and pork now contain more polyunsaturated fats because the animals are fed so much corn and soy.

In 1963, a researcher named P.J. Randle observed that he could block the oxidation of glucose just by feeding an increased amount of fatty acids. This is now called the Randle Cycle. When it became popular to feed hospitalized patients intravenously with a fat emulsion, they discovered it suppressed the immune system and almost immediately caused an elevation of blood glucose—exactly what Randle had noticed.

Diabetes was basically explained biochemically in the 1960s: if you feed more fats, you block the response to insulin and create insulin resistance. This is now called Type 2 diabetes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is this with any kind of fat, or just vegetable fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you feed people or animals a very high sugar diet, you can greatly increase our own synthesis of fats, but these are saturated or monounsaturated fats. Even if you feed so much sugar that you increase triglycerides and fat deposition in the liver, it lowers the toxic effects of free radicals and actually helps to lower blood glucose. Feeding a high sugar diet has an anti-diabetic effect.

Contrasting that with starch—the complex carbohydrate dietitians have recommended for 30 years—starches have the opposite effect. They increase insulin resistance very quickly, just as if you were eating fat, because starches don't support our own production of saturated fat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So vegetable oils lead to increased blood glucose, but saturated fats help protect against it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, with the qualification that eggs, pork, and chicken are now fed so much vegetable oil that their fats are toxic too.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it would only be the more saturated fats like coconut oil or butter.

**Andrew Murray:** What about estrogen as a cofactor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen causes increased deposition of fat in the liver and increased circulating triglycerides. It interacts closely with unsaturated fatty acids. Women typically have more polyunsaturated fatty acids circulating than men do. It is a peculiarity of estrogen that creates a bias making polyunsaturated fats even more toxic.

## Dietary Solutions and Protein

**Andrew Murray:** What are the best solutions for high estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 70 years ago, animal studies showed that a deficiency of protein causes the liver to be unable to remove estrogen or activate thyroid hormone. Just eating more protein can sometimes activate metabolism, cause the ratio to shift toward progesterone, and eliminate estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** But women must be careful to avoid animals fed polyunsaturated fats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You wouldn't want to eat mainly pork, poultry, and fish because those are anti-thyroid. The number of unsaturations in the fatty acid corresponds with its ability to suppress thyroid function. Cutting those oils out as much as possible allows the thyroid to work more efficiently.

I recommend around 80 to 100 grams of protein a day as a minimum. 120 to 150 grams is very good for an active person. Also, reduce starches and replace them with fruit sugar. In animal experiments, they found that adding Coca-Cola to an animal's diet made it lean and able to eat much more food without gaining weight, just because of the sugar.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Were they replacing the starches with Coca-Cola?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Orange juice is the ideal way to get your sucrose. Animal experiments suggest you can increase your metabolic rate by 50%. You would go from getting fat on 1,500 calories a day to getting lean on over 2,000 calories a day.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about people who say they can't eat that much protein because they get kidney stones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eating enough calcium is the best protection against that. The sugar in fruit juice acts very much like Vitamin D. In Vitamin D deficient diets, animals eating starch became calcium deficient, but those eating sugar acted as if they were able to assimilate and retain calcium.

When you eat enough calcium, you suppress inflammatory agents, including the parathyroid hormone, so the calcium goes into your bones rather than forming stones in your kidneys or poisoning your arteries.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So you suggest a high calcium, high protein, and high fruit diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. As a quick therapy diet, I recommend at least two quarts of milk and two quarts of orange juice every day. This will stimulate the thyroid, suppress inflammation, and help the liver regulate things. As it starts working, it will increase caloric needs.

## Caller: Connective Tissue Issues

**Caller:** I heard you talking about cholesterol being important for connective tissue. I was born with a rare disease where I don't have any connective tissue over my whole body. I blister and break open all the time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you tried increased amounts of Vitamin E?

**Caller:** I did when I was younger, but it made me very horny and I couldn't control it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Working on your hormones so that you can use enough of the antioxidants sometimes corrects that blister-susceptible disease.

**Caller:** Could I achieve that goal with a hyperbaric chamber?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Going to a higher altitude, where you get lower oxygen pressure, is actually more likely to help.

## Thyroid and Blood Pressure Mechanisms

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, it's known that hyperthyroidism (high thyroid) can cause high blood pressure. But is there research showing low thyroid also causes high blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In general, research shows that increasing thyroid function lowers blood pressure. I think what has happened over the last 30 or 40 years is that doctors have been confused. I've seen dozens of people diagnosed as hyperthyroid who were actually classical hypothyroid cases.

One thing that happens in hypothyroidism is that the sympathetic nervous system activity and adrenaline production increase to compensate for the lack of thyroid energy production. I've seen hypothyroid people with 40 times the daily output of adrenaline.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So because their metabolism is slow, the body compensates by stimulating adrenaline, which raises blood pressure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I've seen people with a pulse of 180 beats per minute at rest, which was taken as a sign of hyperthyroidism. But when they took thyroid, within a week they had a normal pulse rate of 80 or 90 because it lowered the adrenaline.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you tell us more about the interaction between high blood pressure and thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Toxemia of pregnancy (preeclampsia) got me interested in this. Starting in the 1950s, drug companies told women to take diuretics and restrict salt to prevent high blood pressure. They were actually starving the developing baby of blood supply by reducing blood volume. Adrenaline rises when you restrict salt intake, just as it does when you restrict thyroid function.

Researchers found they could cure toxemia and bring blood pressure down by giving women adequate salt and protein. I suggested to women with PMS—who often get swollen feet—to eat as much sodium as they crave. They found it prevented swelling. I saw old people with similar syndromes; when they went on salt-restricted diets, they developed insomnia, suggesting high adrenaline. When they started eating as much salt as they liked, they slept better and their blood pressure came down.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That is completely counter to what you normally hear.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A man named David McCarron noticed 30 years ago that in government figures, people who ate the most salt had the lowest blood pressure. He showed that it wasn't sodium excess causing high blood pressure, but calcium deficiency. When people didn't eat milk and cheese, they would often eat salty snack foods.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they need to increase salt *and* calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Salt and calcium both increase your metabolic rate and ability to oxidize sugar. The anti-diabetic effect is increased with increasing sodium and calcium.

## Diuretics and Salt

**Andrew Murray:** Do you have any safe methods for increasing diuresis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium helps. By optimizing sugar metabolism, it energizes the kidneys. Baking soda and sodium chloride both have a diuretic effect. The only chemical diuretic I would recommend is Acetazolamide (Diamox). It increases carbon dioxide in your tissues, which helps regulate salt.

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller.

**Caller:** I wondered how olive oil is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's a small quantity, like a tablespoon a day, it's fine. But it does have 10% polyunsaturated fats.

**Caller:** Is it okay when it's cooked?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, those fats are toxic. Even if you eat cold-pressed unsaturated fats, they warm up in your body, and then the blood pumps catalysts and oxygen through the warm fat. It doesn't matter how fresh they are when you eat them; they are going to get rancid once they are in your body.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you explain how salt can be a diuretic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen suppresses your ability to make albumin, makes blood vessels leaky, and causes you to lose sodium. This decreases blood volume. The kidneys then put out hormones that drive the heart to beat harder and tighten blood vessels to increase circulation.

Albumin doesn't work to retain water without an associated cloud of sodium atoms. By eating sodium, the albumin in your bloodstream can osmotically attract water. Eating salt pulls water back into the bloodstream, increases blood volume, perfuses the kidneys, and energizes them so they stop driving the blood vessels to tighten up.

## Caller: Lyme Disease

**Caller:** How does your thyroid relate to Lyme disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The whole immune system is the issue there. A very healthy immune system can throw off chronic infections like Lyme disease. It is best to do it quickly with an antibiotic, but you always want to back up the antibiotic with an optimized immune system. Thyroid, calcium, and Vitamin D are basic things to make your immune system eliminate pathogens without causing inflammation.
