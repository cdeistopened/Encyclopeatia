# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Environmental Pollution, Cancer, and Metabolic Health

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat’s expertise on the show. He has a wealth of wisdom and knowledge; I don't think there are many things I've asked him that he hasn't had a good answer for. This month's subject is a cleanup from last month to get to one or two questions I never got a chance to ask, and then we're going to carry on with pollutants, particulates, and waste creating havoc with biological life.

As usual, I ask people to be moderate about their information and check their sources. There is a wealth of information on the internet and a desire to attract your attention. Take a look at the studies, but look at the background of the studies. I always question Dr. Peat when he comes up with answers, and he points me to studies that are sometimes buried and hard to find. What you often find instead is hype, media sensationalism, cliché answers, or repeated dogma perpetuated in the name of science. Good science will always be answerable. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Just in case people have tuned in for the first time, would you please go over your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied at the University of Oregon in biology, specializing in reproductive physiology and biochemistry related to that, getting my PhD in 1972. Since then, I have continued related study. Around 1960, I decided that any knowledge should be useful. So anytime I find out anything interesting, I try to connect it to practical reality.

## Adolescent Cancers and Prenatal Diet

**Andrew Murray:** I want to finish up with a couple of things I didn't get a chance to ask last month. Figures show a 25% increase over 38 years in the prevalence of cancers in adolescents. This ties into tonight's show because pollutants could be responsible for these cancers. They found that pathologies in adolescents are accelerating. They have implicated obesity, but what do you think from a biological perspective? I know you've done a lot of work on polyunsaturates and the thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think some of it is the present diet and the polluted environment full of carcinogens and estrogens. But I think it actually started a long time ago, influencing prenatal conditions. The parents' exposure is transmitted, affecting the way the child develops in utero and the whole maturing process. Early childhood diseases, like colitis, have increased so much. It isn't likely just a change in the child's diet making them allergic; it's known that the polyunsaturated content of the mother's diet increases the allergies of the babies. So colitis in young children is probably a reaction to the mother's diet, or maybe even earlier exposures of the parents.

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned before why mothers are prescribed fish oils and told it is good for their child's health. You’ve rebutted this with studies showing that while the child may appear more sedate, it is actually a sign of retardation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Last month I mentioned a French study where they thought they were going to demonstrate improved prenatal brain function by giving these extremely unsaturated fats to the mother during pregnancy. They showed just the opposite: it retarded development and learning. In the early 1970s, they were already seeing that polyunsaturated fats during pregnancy made animals develop smaller brains that learned more poorly.

## Rapidly Developing Cancers

**Andrew Murray:** The figures talk about Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, thyroid cancer, myeloid leukemia, and testicular cancer. With myeloid cancers and germ cell cancers, the fundamental cell being formed is subjected to conditions it can't cope with.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What they have in common is rapid growth. The sperm is turning over constantly and the blood cells are in constant diffusion. Irritants accelerate the growth. Polyunsaturated fats, for example, break down; fish oil is always oxidized by the time it gets into the bloodstream. Very little reaches the tissues in its entire form. You get these oxidized fragments that are toxic to rapidly multiplying cells, causing deformity or atrophy in the sperm-forming tissue, and derangement of the blood cells leading to leukemia and lymphoma.

**Andrew Murray:** How long do you think it takes from exposure to manifestation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is much faster in these tissues than in the average tissue. That's why leukemia is seen so often in children just a few years old. A typical cancer, like brain or pancreas cancer, usually takes 20 to 40 years from the carcinogenic primary exposure to the appearance of the fully developed tumor. That delay has been useful to the polluting industries to claim that you can't show the cause-and-effect relationship. But animal studies make it clear that although there is a delay, it is an absolutely causal process.

**Andrew Murray:** Do younger people have more resistance, or are they more susceptible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of those tissues are probably more susceptible because of their extreme speed of turnover. A little deviation in the regulatory process can send them wildly off course. But generally, the extremely high metabolic rate and quick cell division lets young organisms bypass or find a way around the toxic problem.

## Superbugs and Phage Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding *Candida auris*, I don't think you were impressed with the sensational headlines claiming it to be a superbug.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The advertising I've seen connected with it strongly suggests that it's an advertising campaign for new drugs.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding antibiotic resistance, do we have an arsenal to treat infections?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Eastern Europe and Asia, long before penicillin was discovered, people were finding that there are bacteria-killing viruses called bacteriophages. That technology has developed to a high degree, but it's of no interest to countries that have a highly developed pharmaceutical industry. These viruses infect only bacteria and kill certain species. The bacteria never develop resistance to them, and the viruses are perfectly harmless to mammals and people.

**Andrew Murray:** So you think there is enough research being done to produce phages tailored for specific organisms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some people have told stories of being diagnosed as incurably infected with super bacteria, going to Eastern Europe, and getting cured quickly. Southeast Bulgaria, Romania, and India have a good tradition of this.

## Air Pollution and Particulates

**Andrew Murray:** I read an article saying that air pollution is causing damage to every organ in the body, carried up the olfactory nerve into the brain, affecting the thyroid, lungs, and reproductive organs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a few months ago, the accepted number of deaths caused by air pollution was about 4 million per year. A recent World Health Organization study says it's over 8.8 million dying from air pollution.

**Andrew Murray:** I’ve always wondered about the Redwood Coast here. I would imagine the air is relatively clean coming across thousands of miles of ocean.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We do get some smoke and dust from Chinese industry, but the West Coast is far cleaner than the interior. Coming across the ocean does rain out or settle out lots of material.

**Andrew Murray:** When I first came here, I heard about the "Humboldt Hack." I didn't think much of it until I started doing it myself. Is it a redwood allergy or mold?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The foliage of big forests does emit quite a lot of organic material, including pollen, and is probably a cause of a lot of allergies. There is a region in Texas famous for cedar tree allergies. I imagine conifer forests have people who are sensitive to their pollen.

## Plastics and Microplastics

**Andrew Murray:** We recognize how ubiquitous plastic is. The North Pacific Gyre is a floating island of debris. A dive to the Mariana Trench found plastic debris at the bottom. How do these microplastics disrupt the endocrine system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Plastics are generally very hydrophobic. Things like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons—famous carcinogens—concentrate on the surface of the particles. When ingested, they deliver a concentrated dose of these organic carcinogens.

Smaller particles are toxic in a directly structural way. Extremely small nanoparticles pass right through the cells in the circulatory system and are taken up by cells all through the body. Even though they are small, compared to proteins inside the cells, they are relatively huge and foreign to the structure of the cytoplasm. They are necessarily disruptive. One reaction is to make the cell leaky. ATP itself leaks out when cells are structurally irritated by these particles. The ATP is recognized as a danger signal by the environment, creating a storm of cells losing their energy and creating excitement in their environment.

## Seafood Safety

**Andrew Murray:** What about shellfish? I know you advocate for them, but mussels can pick up microplastics. At what point does the negative effect outweigh the benefit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The plastic particles tend to be concentrated up the food chain. The bigger, older organisms are the most polluted and dangerous. Years ago, we stopped eating large fish like orange roughy and halibut because they live a long time and accumulate huge amounts of toxins.

**Andrew Murray:** I ran tests on five different types of fish caught locally on the West Coast. I was staggered at what came back. Tuna, salmon, cod, and bottom fish were loaded with mercury, cadmium, and arsenic—way higher than any wild game like elk or deer. It put me off eating fish.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That information is part of why I'm an advocate of milk. You start with moderately polluted vegetation; a cow eats it and sends it to the rumen, where microorganisms break it down and eliminate many toxic materials. Then it's filtered into the animal's bloodstream and filtered again into the mammary gland. Milk is probably the safest food by a wide margin.

## Glyphosate (Roundup)

**Andrew Murray:** We had a caller asking about the ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate. I saw that there had been massive punitive damages awarded recently for that product regarding cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 30 or 40 years ago, people who studied biology at Oregon State University—a land grant university specializing in agriculture—were telling me that Roundup is specifically toxic to plants, so it can't hurt animals. They were taught that there are biological distinctions between plant and animal cells. But really, we have so much in common that it's not at all surprising that Roundup is extremely toxic to animals too.

## Virility and Phytoestrogens

**Andrew Murray:** In Germany, young men have been found to produce only a third of the sperm that men did 30 years ago.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything injurious creates inflammation, and inflammation leads to the production of estrogen. Anything toxic is going to reduce men's estrogen, testosterone, sperm production, and general virility.

**Andrew Murray:** What is your take on phytoestrogens? Women use black cohosh or wild yam for menopause, but we recognize now that progesterone is what is needed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the herbs are anti-prolactin rather than specifically anti-estrogen, like Vitex, which can be very protective. The official concept of what's estrogenic is what sticks to the "estrogen receptor." But even in the total absence of estrogen, if you injure the cell or cut off the oxygen supply, the estrogen receptor acts like estrogen is present.

Just because a substance binds to the receptor doesn't mean it activates estrogen-like processes. It can inactivate the system depending on what it does to that protein. Estrogen characteristically acts like the loss of oxygen. If you have a so-called phytoestrogen that sticks to the receptor but catalyzes oxidative processes, then it is acting as an anti-estrogen.

## Caller: Vaccines and Immunity

**Caller:** We have not vaccinated our 6-year-old. Being in California, it looks like we might have to. Is there anything herbal or immune-boosting we can do if we decide to vaccinate?

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, how do you feel about the "anti-vax" topic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think many of them are far better informed than the doctors. Suzanne Humphreys, for example, was a kidney specialist who noticed that when her patients were vaccinated at admission, they got worse than those who weren't. She asked the hospital to stop vaccinating her patients, had a fight with officials, and decided to specialize in studying vaccinations.

It's a simple question. There have been national waves, like an epidemic of narcolepsy in Finland following a wave of vaccinations. It's well established that aluminum hydroxide, which is in more than 100 vaccines, is a systemically toxic, pro-inflammatory particle. It is added to rouse a generalized systemic inflammation to make the body react to the antigen. But that same generalized, unfocused inflammatory reaction is exactly what turns on autoimmunity and other degenerative processes.

**Andrew Murray:** To the caller, nutrition is very important. Avoid polyunsaturates and gluten. Support your thyroid. The vitality of our civilization has decreased due to environmental toxins.

## Caller: Flax Oil and Bentonite Clay

**Andrew Murray:** A caller asked about flax versus fish oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Flax is much better in some ways, but it is only slightly more stable than fish oil. Fish oil is very quickly degraded. Flax is a little more persistent and can be more toxic in the long run.

**Andrew Murray:** The other question was whether you recommend bentonite clay for flushing toxins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The clay is slightly soluble in stomach acid and releases at least a little aluminum and other toxins. The particles are susceptible to "persorption." If your intestine is irritated, the contraction can force these particles right into the bloodstream. The particle size can be as much as 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell. Particles getting into the circulatory system can cause considerable microscopic damage.

## Caller: High Cortisol

**Caller:** There is new research about highly sensitive personalities and excess cortisol. What do you think about people who live with gushers of cortisol day-to-day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are lots of things you can do, starting with oxidative metabolism and preserving thyroid function. When your thyroid is functioning efficiently, you can turn your cholesterol fairly massively into pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA, which are the main opponents of cortisol. Cortisol stops inflammation, but it activates degenerative breakdown processes when it isn't backed up by large amounts of these three anti-inflammatory, stabilizing steroids. Adequate protein, Vitamin A, and Vitamin D help you do the conversion to block and reverse the effects of cortisol.

## Liver Function and Bitters

**Andrew Murray:** What about a strategy to improve the liver's function to metabolize waste? Is that relevant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. All tissues apparently have taste receptors, especially for bitter. Bitters act on these receptors to have a calming, stabilizing effect all through the body. The whole energy and protein synthesizing system is involved in detoxifying. The liver uses glucose or fructose, turning it into glucuronic acid, which is attached to toxins for excretion. If you are well-nourished—adequate B vitamins, carbohydrate, and protein—your liver can catch toxic substances, especially hydrophobic materials, and hold them while enzymes degrade them or attach glucuronic acid or sulfate to make them water-soluble for excretion.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned bitters reduce inflammation. How do you link those two?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a protein—the same we have in our tongues—in stomach, liver, and lung tissue that can detect the bitter substance. In doing so, it activates an anti-inflammatory process.

## Caller: Digestive Enzymes

**Caller:** What is your view on supplemental digestive enzymes like lipase and protease to help break down food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The traditional thing was dehydrated animal pancreas tissue. Those are so similar to our own enzymes that they really do work, though you have to be cautious of infection because they are simply dehydrated. I'm skeptical about enzymes derived from fungus. You can't absolutely purify them, so they drag along fungal antigens. If you are sensitive to the fungus, you might have an allergic reaction.

## Conclusion: The Politics of Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the political will to make the world a cleaner place—what do you think?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I can mention a book that is very important on that issue called *The Politics of Cancer* by Samuel Epstein (1978). He shows that the knowledge of how to prevent most cancer has been around for almost 100 years. But the corporations that pollute run the government agencies. The agencies you think should be protecting the public—the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, and universities—are funded so generously by the polluting industries that they are working against the public.

**Andrew Murray:** That is depressing, but *The Politics of Cancer* is worth looking at. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
