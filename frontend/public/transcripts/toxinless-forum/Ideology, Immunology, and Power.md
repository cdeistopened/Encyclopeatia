## The Risks of Spike Proteins and Autoimmunity

[cite_start]Research dating back to 2005 demonstrated that injecting the spike protein from a coronavirus caused lung failure, and that antibodies formed against the spike protein damaged the lungs[cite: 7].

  * [cite_start]**Autoimmune Mechanisms:** It has been known for decades that autoimmune diseases (like "rheumatic fever") can result from cross-reactions between microbial antigens and a person's tissue antigens[cite: 8].
  * [cite_start]**Current Confirmations:** Recent studies confirm the risk of autoimmune disease from antibodies to the COVID spike protein[cite: 9]. [cite_start]One specific cross-reaction occurs with the lung surfactant protein[cite: 10].
  * [cite_start]**Broader Implications:** Cross-reactive antibodies and autoimmune processes are also implicated in infertility and cancer[cite: 11].

[cite_start]Given the toxic effects of both the spike protein and the antibodies produced against it, utilizing it in a vaccine would have appeared to be "criminal insanity" to anyone following immunological research after 2005[cite: 12]. [cite_start]However, corporations and government officials found it convenient to ignore this science[cite: 13]. [cite_start]For instance, in 2017, the chief medical officer of Moderna described causing the body to produce its own vaccine as a simple, "nifty" idea[cite: 14, 15].

## Natural vs. Adaptive Immunity

### Natural Antibodies

  * [cite_start]**Development:** Natural antibodies exist at birth, developing alongside tissue differentiation[cite: 21].
  * [cite_start]**Function:** They persist throughout life (though they decrease with age), serving to protect tissues by recognizing and eliminating deviations from the normal[cite: 22, 23].
  * [cite_start]**Safety:** They do not inactivate the body's own tissues, meaning the issue of autoimmunity and cross-reactivity does not exist with natural antibodies[cite: 22, 27].

### Adaptive Immunity and Cross-Reactivity

[cite_start]In contrast, when specialized adaptive antibodies are produced via infection or vaccination, cross-reactivity is a constant risk[cite: 27].

  * [cite_start]**Mechanism:** Antibodies binding to foreign organisms may have varying degrees of affinity for human tissues[cite: 27].
  * [cite_start]**Example:** Lactobacilli thriving in fertile women have antigens resembling human connective tissues, which may be a factor in diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis[cite: 28].
  * [cite_start]**Risk Factors:** Vaccination or infection can permanently damage health, particularly when there is a deficiency of anti-inflammatory factors or an excess of estrogen[cite: 29].

## The COVID-19 Context: Testing and Early Cases

[cite_start]The first reported COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. occurred in late February 2020 involving elderly individuals in an extended care home[cite: 30].

### The PCR Test Controversy

  * [cite_start]**Authorization:** Deaths were attributed to COVID based on PCR tests authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization, without normal validation[cite: 31].
  * [cite_start]**Cycle Thresholds:** The WHO recommended, and the CDC ordered, the test to be run at 40 to 45 cycles[cite: 32]. [cite_start]It is known that this level produces mostly false positive results[cite: 32].
  * [cite_start]**The "Test Epidemic":** As testing increased in March 2020, "cases" increased at the same rate, creating an eagerness for inoculation[cite: 32, 33].
  * [cite_start]**Shifting Standards:** Once the inoculation campaign began, the WHO changed instructions to reduce the number of cycles[cite: 35]. [cite_start]This immediately reduced false positives, creating the impression that vaccines were lowering infection rates[cite: 35].

## Historical Perspectives on Immunology

### Paul Ehrlich and the "Magic Bullet"

[cite_start]In the late 19th century, Paul Ehrlich developed a theory based on the affinity of dyes for specific bacteria[cite: 36].

  * [cite_start]**Theory:** He proposed that the ability of dyes to kill specific organisms was analogous to specific immunity[cite: 37].
  * [cite_start]**Legacy:** This led to the "magic bullet" concept of drug therapy, reinforcing the idea that every disease has a specific drug remedy[cite: 40]. [cite_start]This theory perfectly matched the interests of the pharmaceutical industry[cite: 58].

### Metchnikov’s Holistic View

[cite_start]Conversely, Metchnikov’s 1908 Nobel lecture presented immunity as a pervasive, multi-level process involving tissue maintenance and learning[cite: 42].

  * [cite_start]**Suppression:** This view was largely ignored or disparaged until the late 20th century[cite: 43].
  * [cite_start]**Quinine:** Metchnikov identified quinine as the only substance known to assist the innate immune system[cite: 44].

## Treatments: Quinine, Chloroquine, and Synthetics

[cite_start]Recent studies show that **quinine** reduces the activation of cytokines and antibodies by Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)[cite: 45]. [cite_start]Conversely, factors like angiotensin, the COVID virus, endotoxin, estrogen, and ionizing radiation activate TLRs[cite: 46, 48].

  * [cite_start]**Development of Synthetics:** Synthetic versions like chloroquine were developed in the 1930s to bypass Dutch control of the world quinine supply, not because they were superior[cite: 51]. [cite_start]Hydroxychloroquine was produced in 1950 to reduce retinal toxicity[cite: 52].
  * [cite_start]**Efficacy vs. Safety:** While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine block coronavirus infection, recent comparisons show that natural quinine is equally effective at blocking infection in human cells but is safer[cite: 53, 54].

## Evolving Theories of Immunity

[cite_start]The dominant antibody theory of immunity was based on Macfarlane Burnet's "clonal deletion" theory[cite: 60]. This has been challenged by newer concepts:

  * [cite_start]**Network Theory:** Niels Jerne proposed an "idiotype-antiidiotype network," suggesting a more complex interaction than simple clonal deletion[cite: 66].
  * [cite_start]**Danger and Damage Theories:** Theories by Jamie Cunliffe ("morphostasis") and Polly Matzinger ("danger theory") view immunity as a process of generating and maintaining the organism[cite: 59, 61].
  * [cite_start]**Mechanism:** When cells are damaged, they release internal components (DNA, RNA, ATP) that signal the need for repair[cite: 62]. [cite_start]Unfamiliar antigens are eliminated as part of this repair process[cite: 63].

## Histamine, Inflammation, and Metabolism

[cite_start]The "immune system" should not be viewed as distinct from metabolic processes[cite: 69].

### The Role of Histamine

  * [cite_start]**Production:** Under extreme conditions, all cells can produce histamine, often triggered by energy deprivation[cite: 73, 74].
  * [cite_start]**Function:** Histamine activates immune functions, including TLRs, cytokines, and antibodies[cite: 74]. [cite_start]It signals danger or damage[cite: 75].
  * [cite_start]**Risks:** Prolonged excess histamine tends to calcify soft tissues and promotes inflammation and coagulation[cite: 79, 85].
  * [cite_start]**Management:** Increased oxidative metabolism lowers histamine and inflammation systemically[cite: 88].

### COVID-19 as an Inflammatory Disease

[cite_start]COVID-19 infection inactivates the ACE2 enzyme, which destroys angiotensin II (a promoter of inflammation)[cite: 78]. [cite_start]Consequently, COVID is a disease of inflammation and coagulation[cite: 78, 79].

  * [cite_start]**Treatment Approaches:** China treated early infections with anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants[cite: 80].
  * [cite_start]**Western Response:** Governments outside China discouraged early treatment until hospitalization was required[cite: 81]. [cite_start]Remdesivir, approved by the FDA, is neither anti-inflammatory nor anticoagulant and lists inflammation as a side effect[cite: 82, 83].
  * [cite_start]**Metabolic Energy:** Energy metabolism governs the effectiveness of the immune process and the avoidance of autoimmunity[cite: 91].

## Critique of RNA Vaccine Development

[cite_start]Moderna had been working on RNA vaccines and testing them on mice prior to the pandemic[cite: 94]. [cite_start]Upon receiving the genetic code, they produced the vaccine in mere hours[cite: 94].

  * **Overlooked Risks:** In the rush, it appears risks were ignored, including:
      * [cite_start]Systemic spread of the vaccine[cite: 95].
      * [cite_start]Infection of blood vessel linings (endothelial cells) with spike protein[cite: 95].
      * [cite_start]Systemic clotting and inflammation[cite: 95].
      * [cite_start]Lung damage from spike proteins or anti-spike antibodies[cite: 97].
      * [cite_start]The "shedding" phenomenon[cite: 98].
  * [cite_start]**Conclusion:** These oversights imply either a lack of attention to physiology/immunology or that the intent was not the improvement of public health[cite: 99, 100].
