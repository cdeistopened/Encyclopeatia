---## Introduction: The State of the World

**Danny Roddy:** Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov, how are you guys? Ray, how are you first of all? And Georgi Dinkov?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Not bad. Surrounded by more National Guards than I've ever seen in my life, but things are still, I guess, under control.

**Danny Roddy:** No civil war yet.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yeah. There are about 25,000 troops in DC right now. That's just the National Guard. The place is teeming with civilian and undercover cops, state police. I don't even know what agency they belong to, but it's pretty obvious there is law enforcement because they have guns and pull out badges at the first sign of commotion. There is more law enforcement on the street than people at this point.

**Danny Roddy:** I'm sure we'll get into that more, but Ray, we haven't chatted in about a month. Where is the most important place to start? What's the most critical information to chat about?

**Ray Peat:** That nothing new has indicated that there's a pandemic or epidemic at all.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was going to say, have you seen the news of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? How many people started suddenly dying in Norway and in Israel? Basically, the effectiveness that they claim is there, apparently is not. Twelve thousand people in Israel immediately got infected after getting vaccinated.

**Ray Peat:** And in one county of New York, which had been free of the so-called virus for a whole month, vaccination started in one nursing home on December 22nd. They vaccinated 198 old people, and in about two weeks, 23 or 24 of those had died. That is a huge statistical indication. The nursing home people said, "Well, they had a local epidemic of the virus that happened to kill only the vaccinated people."

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think they're dying from the lipid adjuvant or from the actual mRNA operating system?

**Ray Peat:** I think it's the adjuvant, and no one is talking about that. I think they falsely labeled it as a carrier for the RNA when those same things have been sold for years as adjuvants.

**Danny Roddy:** So the RNA aspect of the vaccine is less dangerous than the polyethylene glycol lipid adjuvant?

**Ray Peat:** I would guess so. But regarding the long-range possibility of having the RNA for making the spike protein—which creates inflammation—if we become permanent factories for inflammation proteins, that isn't a good thing.

## Vaccine Anomalies and Testing

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you see the news about the Australian vaccine? It's already been terminated, but it contains a portion of the HIV virus. As soon as they started giving it to people, people started testing HIV positive. So they freaked out and shut down the vaccine. They said, "Don't worry, it's not causing HIV infection." But you have only two choices: either the vaccine causes HIV infection, or the tests that are detecting HIV positive people are useless.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's nice that there are frauds being put to the test.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Now Lin Wood, the lawyer, is saying that apparently some of his friends that got vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine—which shouldn't contain any HIV particles—are also testing HIV positive. Do you think that maybe the mRNA is somehow activating our internal retroviruses, and that's what's causing the positive tests? Remember, Luc Montagnier, the French Nobel Prize winner, claimed that he identified some HIV in the stretch of RNA that's used.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. I agree with Peter Duesberg, though, that there has never been any evidence that such a virus causes the AIDS condition.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Right. But in any case, it's probably not a positive sign that the retrovirus is activated by this vaccine.

**Ray Peat:** What will activate a positive test might only take a stretch of two or three nucleotides to indicate a similarity to the HIV virus.

**Georgi Dinkov:** For the PCR test, if its sensitivity is cranked up all the way to the max—I think right now they're using 40 cycles for the coronavirus—if you crank it up even more, can you come up with positive tests for pretty much any virus? Because they're so similar. There's probably an overlap of at least 10% across all viruses.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. I think they ordered people to test all across the country using that many turns of the cycle because they knew it would create supposed evidence of a big epidemic. I'm sure that if they can get a large number of people vaccinated, then they're going to change the instruction, go back to actually measuring something rather than producing false positives, and then use that to claim that the vaccine eliminated the epidemic.

## Social Control and Philosophy

**Danny Roddy:** Probably one of the darkest things I've read is the idea that if you deny a vaccine—you don't want to be a guinea pig for an experimental new technology—you'll be labeled as a public health threat or a domestic terrorist. Do you think that will be part of this whole thing, gathering people together that refuse to get vaccinated?

**Ray Peat:** They're already doing something like that by having the communication websites censor and prevent those people from posting. The general public is being designated effectively a domestic terrorist if they want to post dissenting information. That was one of Biden's proposals, to have a new category of domestic terrorism so the government could enforce all of the internet to identify these people and keep them from posting anywhere.

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi, do you have any questions? I was going to try to go as far back as possible regarding history. My main question was, does this go back 200 years to the Battle of Waterloo and how the Rothschilds formed their fortune, and then the industrialists like the Rockefellers? Is that an effective way of understanding how we arrived here?

**Ray Peat:** I think so. One strand of culture is coming out in insane ways. In the last several years of getting emails, I've had only maybe half a dozen really insane-sounding people. Just in the last week, I've had more letters like that than in all 20 years that I've used the internet.

I've had people blaming numerology on the Jesuits, even though it originated in the Old Testament. But the Jewish Kabbalah in particular promoted and amplified this essentialist idea that God spoke Hebrew, and that every letter and word of Hebrew is a coded message from God. People like Noam Chomsky studied the Kabbalah as a kid. That philosophy says that you can assert anything that numerology confirms, and you don't need any real-world evidence because the Hebrew word defines reality.

Chomsky used it to bypass the people who wanted to explain language as a matter of the brain dealing with the world. He said, "No, you don't need any evidence at all." The way you get that scientific view of language is to treat the person and the brain as an absolute black box. Don't try to look for any information coming from the people who use language and experience it constantly.

So if you don't have words, you can't think. For example, he said that his dogs—he called them "canines"—don't understand what he is saying because they have no words. But then he explained that he used the word "canine" because if he spoke the word "dog," they would make the "wrong" conclusion that one wanted to do something with them. So he demonstrated that they *are* thinking and would draw a conclusion if he used the word dog, but then denied that thought is possible without words.

This is a deep scientific heresy cutting out empiricism. This is the greatest danger happening now. Everyone is being discouraged from looking for evidence. That forces you to rely on the experts and whoever is running the cult of the time.

## Essentialism and Economics

**Georgi Dinkov:** Something I didn't realize is that Rothschild wealth is two centuries older than the Rockefellers. In that case, were the Rockefellers agents of the Rothschilds, or did they work together?

**Ray Peat:** I don't know how much of a mental overlap there was at the time they got in cahoots, but I think essentialism is what they all develop in context and then reinforce each other's tendency in that direction.

**Danny Roddy:** And what is essentialism?

**Ray Peat:** It's the idea that you don't need empirical evidence to develop true knowledge of the world. Exactly what Chomsky did with the brain, treating it as a black box. For example, they treat the history of an atom as not existing. This "essence" of what an atom is applies for all time, everywhere in the universe. So you don't want to look for the effect of time on individual atoms. Reductionism is generally making that claim: that we already know what chemical reactions are and what atoms are. If the organism is nothing but atoms, and atoms aren't to be investigated temporally, then we have essential knowledge. Ultimately, if we reduce the organism to atoms and reactions, we already know everything we need to know.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question on economics. It's related to Marx and his theory of why the modern state seems to always lead to wars and destruction. He calls it the "tendency of the profit rate to decline." Basically, as capitalists make production more capital-intensive and shun labor, the profit rate declines because, according to Marx, value is only produced by labor. Ultimately, this leads to conflict. Are you familiar with his thought on that?

**Ray Peat:** Not in detail, but he thought that process would lead automatically to socialism. Lenin's insight was that as long as you can keep developing colonies, including the whole world in the process, every time capitalism is failing, you have to open up new populations. Lenin thought that imperialism was the result: every time capitalism would have died, they expand and organize new markets.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If there are no more colonies, because we live in a fairly developed world, then ultimately that would have to lead to a conflict. The only option is to start the destruction of the wealth that was already produced inside of that country—specifically the wealth of the middle and lower classes—so they can usurp it at pennies on the dollar.

## Preparedness and Food Storage

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, regarding surviving the "Great Reset," you've mentioned having a chicken or a goat or being able to produce your own food. Is there anything else you're doing to protect yourself or would recommend?

**Ray Peat:** In the short term, having storable food is logical. But because electricity is essential for ordinary living, you can't store perishable food in the freezer because they just have to turn off the electricity for a week and everything is spoiled.

**Danny Roddy:** I have a list here: UHT milk, honey, white sugar, canned oysters, canning salt, frozen meat (if you have power), Mexican Coke, coffee, powdered gelatin, powdered milk, applesauce with no additives, canned fruit without citric acid, baking soda. Is there anything else?

**Ray Peat:** Ordinary granulated white sugar, ghee, and coconut oil are intense calorie sources that are good for a medium-term shutdown.

**Danny Roddy:** And that UHT milk, does it last longer than the six months on the label?

**Ray Peat:** Oh yeah, that date is basically so they can keep selling powdered milk. The taste gradually deteriorates if it's exposed to oxygen, but if it's well sealed, I've had some five-year-old powdered milk. I've eaten ultra-pasteurized milk far beyond the expiration date and didn't notice the taste was any worse.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you see the recent changes by the FDA in food safety regulations? They explained they had to do it because of the pandemic, but now they're allowing vendors to replace most ingredients as they see fit without changing the label. For example, replacing coconut oil with cottonseed or canola oil in mayonnaise.

**Ray Peat:** Even five years ago, the Department of Agriculture was allowing horrible things to bypass labeling requirements as "processing agents."

**Georgi Dinkov:** I actually got some organic milk brands that were giving me digestive issues. I sent samples to a lab, and they came back saying these milks contained silica and gums, even though neither was listed on the label. I called the vendor, and they said as long as it's under a limit—I think less than one gram per serving—they aren't required to report it.

## Aging and Stress

**Danny Roddy:** Let's take a listener question from Abraham regarding the aging process. He asks: "What would it take to stop aging and reverse the process? What therapies or technologies do we need?"

**Ray Peat:** I think the basic process is epigenetic, and it involves small adaptations constantly to an improper environment for our type of organism. If we can cause all of our adaptations to be directed by our central intention—what we feel ourselves to be and the need—aging could basically be stopped.

Every little adjustment to stress leaves an epigenetic residue in the tissues, slowing metabolism, lowering oxygen consumption while increasing glycolytic energy production. The consequences are a gradual increase in proteins like heat shock protein and collagen, and a progressive lowering of mitochondrial processes. The organism gets drier and drier, but the individual cells inside this dehydrating framework become more and more inflamed.

I think of running downhill as an extreme example of adjusting in the wrong direction. If you stretch a muscle under tension, that leaves damage behind and very quickly lowers the oxidative ability of the cell. Some Canadian exercise physiologists have old people do exclusively concentric exercise in which you don't have any adjustment to the forced extension of muscles. Our culture is forcing our organism to go ways that it really doesn't want to go.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If an organism is depleted of PUFA (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids), wouldn't the maladaptive process be much slower?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, all kinds of experiments have demonstrated that PUFAs accelerate all of the bad processes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A study just came out finding that simply blocking the prostaglandin E2 receptor basically fully reverses signs of brain aging. I thought, what a politically convenient way to not implicate PUFA. But to knowledgeable people, it means that without PUFA there can be no brain aging. Does that apply to every tissue?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. The prostaglandin system is the final amplifier of the stress-intensifying function.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In terms of controlling the stress reaction, it starts at the hypothalamus with hormones like CRH and TRH. Several studies show these peptides are highly inflammatory. Do you think there's any benefit in suppressing the reaction of the hypothalamus to stress?

**Ray Peat:** Good conditions will do it. Thyroid supplements are one of the important things for keeping down the stress produced by TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). There's a gradually increasing awareness that TSH is what causes the circulatory damage of hypothyroidism. As TSH goes up, the deterioration—atherosclerosis, hypertension—is created by the TSH itself.

## Philosophy of History and Intentionality

**Danny Roddy:** This question is from Oren: "Can you speak on the history of philosophy? Does the Hegelian idea of progress and post-Enlightenment rationalism lead to our current situation? How does this tie in with neo-Darwinist views, and how should we correctly conceptualize the human organism?"

**Ray Peat:** I think the idea of intentionality is what governs the organism. In philosophy, there was a jump where Edmund Husserl and Alexius Meinong proposed concentrating on intentional processes. Around the same time, early 20th-century embryology showed that if you split an early embryo, you get two complete organisms. This showed it's not just a mechanical process; there is an intention to become a certain sort of thing.

Every undesirable experience the developing organism has diverts it from its best intentions. Bertrand Russell brought back a lot of the rationalist and hidden essentialism. His idea of "logical atoms" semi-consciously incorporated ideas of strict reductionist Darwinism, racism, and imperialism.

**Danny Roddy:** When I was reading about the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, Immanuel Kant came up a few times. Is that one of the undesirable philosophies?

**Ray Peat:** Yes. It started about 1900 and was one of the most evil but widespread influences. Kantianism is sort of the ultimate denial of empiricism. In practice, we always find a way to remain essentialist and rationalist.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Would you say that the physical basis of intentionality in the human organism is a potential difference between the organism and the environment?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. I think the degree of success that the organism finds in keeping its basic purpose despite the slight deviations is what leads to delayed aging.

## Hair Loss and Hormones

**Danny Roddy:** Austin asks about vellus hairs turning to terminal hairs. Babies have thin hair that turns thick; balding people have the reverse. Is it possible to turn vellus hairs back to terminal hairs?

**Ray Peat:** I've experimented several times with using DHEA in oil on the sides of my eyebrows that have gradually gone through aging and disappearance. It took about six months to create new, dark, normal hairs. Using a topical copper solution, the very next day I could see the colored hair beginning at the base. In the case of lost hairs, it was a very slow process.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think there's a difference between the hair type a baby has and a balding person has. Babies have low androgens and high pregnenolone. Balding people tend to have high levels of estrogen and prolactin in the scalp. Both prolactin and estrogen are known to destroy the follicle.

**Ray Peat:** There have been interesting studies on dogs. Certain dogs became completely bald when their owners started supplementing estrogen on their skin.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Isn't a good indication that estrogen and prolactin are involved in hair loss the fact that most menopausal women start having serious problems with hair thinning?

**Ray Peat:** Yes. The whole "menopause is estrogen failure" idea is a total fraud created by the industry to sell a product. First, they prescribed estrogen to prevent miscarriage, even after it had been demonstrated to cause miscarriage.

In rat studies, when ovaries are removed, within a week the rats were right back to their normal estrogen level but without progesterone. My dissertation was based on the fact that sterility in the middle of the lifespan is caused by unopposed estrogen. But the drug companies have kept this misguided idea that there's a lack of estrogen at menopause. All of the symptoms of menopause can be produced by too much estrogen or too little progesterone.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there's a reason studies always focus on estradiol as if it's the only type of estrogen?

**Ray Peat:** There have been studies calling for endocrinology to evaluate its position because they only measure estradiol. If you measure estrone sulfate in menopausal women, it is very, very high. Stress and lack of progesterone shift the enzymes so every cell becomes able to convert estrone into the 10 times more active estradiol.

The most important measurement made was comparing the estrogen content in the vein coming out of the ovary to the vein coming out of an arm. They found the arm was producing just as much estrogen as the ovary. The whole body is always producing estrogen, and it's the whole body's stress-induced estrogen that has to be controlled.

## Digestion and Crohn's Disease

**Danny Roddy:** Daniel asks about a flare-up of Crohn's disease. Any recommendations besides glycine and collagen?

**Ray Peat:** Undoubtedly estrogen is involved. I've been recommending both thyroid and progesterone for about 45 years, and everyone that has tried it has improved their symptoms.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is the estrogen shifting the redox balance of the intestine, causing inflammation?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Increased reduction is the same as failed oxidation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Older studies demonstrated that you can put inflammatory bowel disease in remission by gonadectomizing animals. If they administered androgens or progesterone, they stayed in remission, which proves estrogen is the direct cause. Also, studies in the 80s treated Crohn's and ulcerative colitis with 100,000 units of Vitamin D weekly to induce remission.

**Ray Peat:** Yes, I think Vitamin D is effective taken orally. The things that reduce inflammation cure all sorts of chronic diseases. This could be a dose of 50,000 or 100,000 units of Vitamin D orally to get started. Progesterone and aspirin—everything that is a safe anti-inflammatory agent—has been used against these diseases.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, didn't you know Vitamin D was toxic?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, I've heard that a thousand times. The receptor is a good sign of deficiency of Vitamin D. As you become deficient in the storage form (25-hydroxy), you begin to produce both the receptor and the so-called "active" Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy). People get confused and fail to see that the "active" form and the receptor are associated with toxic effects that are reduced by adequate calcium and the storage form of Vitamin D.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does intracellular calcium turn on aromatase?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, excitation of the cell generally turns on stress and the tendency to be on the estrogen pathway. That is part of the aging process. But a deficiency of dietary calcium also increases aromatase because it increases PTH (Parathyroid Hormone). Like a deficiency of good Vitamin D, calcium deficiency increases stress and activates the whole system: endotoxin, aldosterone, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen.

## Gut Health and Endotoxin

**Danny Roddy:** Will asks: "For someone who has utilized the carrot salad, mushrooms, and antibiotics yet still has chronic endotoxin symptoms and low cholesterol, what are good strategies?"

**Ray Peat:** Great care with what you eat is part of it. Anything that irritates your bowel is a risk. Sometimes you have to be fairly extreme to start improving the situation. Trying different forms of fiber can help find one that reduces inflammation.

**Danny Roddy:** What about antibiotics like penicillin or tetracycline?

**Ray Peat:** All of those sometimes help.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I know you've spoken favorably of charcoal, but cautioned against it absorbing into the bloodstream. Wouldn't combining charcoal with the carrot salad reduce those risks?

**Ray Peat:** It does seem logical, but it's something I would prefer to leave to rat experiments because any kind of unmetabolizable particle, if it gets persorbed, basically kills off part of your whole system.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have confidence in *Biosporin* (probiotic)?

**Ray Peat:** *Biosporin* can be very powerful because the bacteria in it are producers of antibiotics. When I used it, I would let it sit in a glass of milk at room temperature until there was a delicate coagulation, then put it in the refrigerator and use only a spoonful per day. That way, the extreme dilution of the preservative wouldn't be a factor.

**Georgi Dinkov:** How long does it take for a sterilized gut to get recolonized?

**Ray Peat:** It sometimes happens in a week, but sometimes people don't manage to get it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've had people report that eating a few tablespoons of coconut oil daily gave them loose stools, but then they felt blissfully well for a week. Do you think that's the antibiotic effect?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's effective against both fungus and bacteria, but you have to make sure you aren't allergic to it.

## Temperature and Metabolism

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Ray Peat:** Aging of the cell. Following up on the effect of temperature. I concentrated on cold last time; this one is going to concentrate on the energy deficit effect, which can be produced by heat stress, reductive stress, or any stress that goes with energy deprivation.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned to Patrick Timpone that the likely cause of many deaths is just the temperature getting too low.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. A lot of people don't bother checking the temperature of the mouth, eardrum, and extremities. Old people in particular might have a brain at a good temperature, but they're producing less energy, and that shows up as an extreme gradient from the extremities to the brain.

The indoor temperature might be 70 degrees and seem safe, but even through insulated walls, the outside temperature can profoundly drain your body's energy-producing ability. That's because a large percentage of our biological energy goes out as radiation—microwaves and infrared. If it isn't reciprocated by returning radiation from something approaching body temperature, your body is draining vastly more energy. That's why aspirin, a snack before bed, progesterone, and thyroid are so important right before sleep.

## Vagus Nerve and Shock

**Danny Roddy:** Brandon asks about "Kototama" or sacred sound mantra practices to tone the vagus nerve as a top-down approach to modulating stress.

**Ray Peat:** Shock is the extreme degree of most of these things we've been talking about. Hans Selye was the first to propose that estrogen imitates a shock reaction. I think that applies to many of the stimulating techniques of the vagus nerve. You have to be very watchful for estrogenic influences when you specifically stimulate the vagus.

## CO2 and Consciousness

**Danny Roddy:** Jake asks about your previous comment that a large release of carbon dioxide from the earth could lead to a planetary shift in consciousness.

**Ray Peat:** I think the earth is basically doing the best things it can. Melting tundra ice is releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. If the earth is expanding, as some measurements suggest, that would dilute the atmosphere, resembling high altitude.

At high altitude, you see both acceleration and reduction of stress hormones. When T3 increases, cortisol doesn't increase at high altitude. Brain oxidative metabolism increases with higher CO2. That greater consumption of electrons is tending to keep the brain in a positive, productive, more conscious condition.

## UFOs and Distraction

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, we seem to have been inundated with recent UFO news. What is your take on the general UFO agenda?

**Ray Peat:** I think it's a risk in a time of crisis. A lot of us will be declared domestic terrorists for doubting Fauci. It will be a welcome distraction to get people's minds off the critics.

**Danny Roddy:** Is it purely an agenda for control?

**Ray Peat:** It functions that way. It's hard to tell whether it's just the silliness of broadcasters who know what they shouldn't write about. It's on the safe list.

**Danny Roddy:** Could any of these be extraterrestrial?

**Ray Peat:** It's a possibility, but I would give priority to all kinds of government fraud over actual evidence of aliens. The fact that it's being released specifically now makes it that much more suspect.

## MDMA and Serotonin

**Danny Roddy:** Nick asks: "If the mechanism of MDMA (Ecstasy) is a big release of serotonin, and serotonin is a stress chemical, why do people feel so happy and loving on it?"

**Ray Peat:** Obviously, it's releasing a lot of processes in the brain. The fact that it damages the brain comes from the excess serotonin. But I would guess that the good feeling comes from the general over-excitation of the brain.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is it a cultural cliché to say "this drug makes me happy, therefore it's increasing serotonin"?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, it is strictly a cliché.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think it's a dose-dependent effect. MDMA is in clinical trials for PTSD, and at very low doses, it has a powerful antidepressant effect tied to a large release of dopamine and a drop of cortisol. My opinion is that MDMA is serotonergic only if you abuse it in very high doses.

## The Euphoria of Metabolism

**Danny Roddy:** Tim asks about a comment you made previously: "If you're not in the euphoric state, then there's something wrong with you." Can you expand on that?

**Ray Peat:** Things like carbon dioxide and adequate oxidation of glucose should give you a 24-hour-a-day euphoria. Anything that interferes with this highly efficient energy production is amplifying damage.

**Danny Roddy:** How do you define euphoria?

**Ray Peat:** That life feels good. Feeling your breathing, feeling your heartbeat, and feeling the blood circulate through your tissues—all of that is background. All of it feels good. It gives a general tone to everything you're thinking and doing.

Doctors have been thinking of euphoria as something dangerous. If thyroid leads to euphoria, they'll tell you to stop taking it because they think of those good feelings as not quite compatible with life.

If you ask a person to pay attention to their heart beating, they often get nervous. But a typical response to the exactly right dose of thyroid is, "Thyroid is love." A feeling that radiates out of the chest. If you're low in thyroid, those same areas of your body report anxiety. The experience of love is probably the best description of what the euphoria of metabolism is doing.

**Danny Roddy:** That's awesome. Ray, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Georgi, thank you as always. Stay safe everyone.
