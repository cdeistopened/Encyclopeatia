## Ukraine, Russia, and the Geopolitical Landscape

**Danny Roddy:** We were just talking about Mexico, but what I really wanted to discuss is everything that has happened recently. Last time we spoke, the Russia-Ukraine situation was just coming to a head. Can you unpack it for us? What do you think is going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone should really understand what the Azov Battalion is. They are an extremist group involved in acts like setting a union hall on fire while dozens of people were inside; as people came out, they killed some, and most burned to death. They march under a swastika flag, and their hero is Bandera, who was a major genocidist under Hitler. They are just about the nastiest people you can imagine.

They were integrated into Ukraine's National Guard because the breakaway republics favored unions and nominally favored socialism. Since the oligarch-related Nazis control the government in Kiev, they get along nicely together. In the Donetsk breakaway area, the Azov Battalion is leading an attempt to genocide the Russian-speaking population. Kiev assigned them that job after they outlawed speaking Russian and revoked rights for ethnic Russians. The Kiev government has been shelling them constantly for seven years.

**Danny Roddy:** Didn't they send the Azov Battalion in, and there were rumors they crucified people in the Eastern Republics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what I've heard. I didn't want to look at the videos.

**Danny Roddy:** How does this play into the larger empire game? Do you think this kicked off as a cover for a larger crime?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is likely part of it. Victoria Nuland was openly talking about installing a puppet government in 2014, explaining that they had invested a lot of money. Crucial to the coup was having snipers kill Ukrainian policemen as well as demonstrators to make the people believe the government was killing demonstrators. It was a U.S.-promoted coup right from the start.

The nominal purpose is that the U.S., under Clinton, decided to expand NATO right up to all of Russia's borders, despite Bush promising Gorbachev NATO would not expand another inch. That promise was just to relax the Russians so they could move nuclear weapons up to their borders. When Putin became active in saying he couldn't tolerate any more advances—after several former Russian republics had been assimilated by NATO—Russia fought back in Georgia.

The goal of having NATO against Russia's borders is to use those weapons to threaten Russia to the point that they could change the government and break up the Russian state. This would allow the vast amount of resources to be divided up, just like Hitler had in mind. This attitude of the U.S. and Britain has continued since the First World War; their purpose has been to keep Russia from cooperating closely with Germany. Germany has always had leading technology, and Russia has unlimited resources in grain, timber, and minerals. Everyone realized that if Hitler conquered Russia and took their resources, it would give Germany absolute control of the world.

That mindset continues. Anything favoring Germany doing business with Russia has been inactivated. Now, by manipulating world opinion, they have practically forced their puppet government in Germany to cut off their main energy supplies—cheap natural gas and oil from Russia—which is essential to the German economy. They are forcing Germany to eventually bankrupt itself, while the U.S. continues buying vast amounts of Russian gas and oil.

**Georgi Dinkov:** How does someone like Nuland get on the record plotting to kill foreign officials and not fall under the U.S. law that prohibits officials from doing that abroad?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** International law is a concept that came in with the United Nations. When the U.S. talks about the "rules," they are throwing out the tradition of 70 years of international law.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think there is an actual U.S. law that says no government employee is allowed to actively plot the assassination of a foreign government official.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All treaties are technically law in the U.S. When Congress ratifies a treaty, that makes it national law. But if you look at the history of U.S. treaties, no one obeys the law.

**Danny Roddy:** How does this navigate the oligarchs into a one-world government situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Their one-world government has to be ruled by the U.S. There are extremists in the government who, since Kennedy's time, have seriously believed "better dead than red." The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was constantly maneuvering to get a world war using atomic weapons.

**Danny Roddy:** One of the big narratives is that the liberal Democrats are pro-Ukraine, the right-leaning Republicans are pro-Russia, and the fringe conspiracy people say the whole thing is theater. Why would you reject the idea that Putin is playing a villain so they can execute a cyber attack or similar event?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Trump was a big interference with the American plan to keep Germany as a puppet state and dissolve the Russian state. When Trump said he could do business with Russia and didn't think wars were a good idea, they immediately claimed he was conspiring with Putin. That whole thing was a conspiratorial fabrication coming out of the Democratic Party organization, with Hillary leading the way referring to Putin as Hitler.

**Danny Roddy:** Where do you see this leading? It has gotten intense so quickly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Where Russia is losing ground is in public relations because the story of "Satanic Putin" has been so efficiently propagated. Even sane people can't hear what they hear or see what they read. For example, someone emailed me claiming Putin said his purpose was to "de-communize" Ukraine and that he is a fascist. What I heard him say was his purpose was to "de-nazify" Ukraine. Since the breakaway republics favored socialism, the West had to claim his purpose was actually to commit genocide against socialists.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the claims that Putin is trying to re-establish the USSR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard suggestions of that. One of the critics' lines is that because Putin frequently uses the word "God," spiritual values, and traditional morality, he is a secret fascist. However, Stalin stopped the active persecution of religion in the early 1940s because he saw that nearly everyone in Russia was an Orthodox believer. Putin is following Stalin to that degree; he uses concepts natural to his country regarding spiritual values. This offends the so-called Marxists in Russia who want to go back to the old-fashioned persecution of believers.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the polls in the former Soviet republics? Actual people on the ground, in numbers of two-thirds or more, favor the return of the Soviet Union simply because their lives were more stable or human under the old system. Right now, you have 1% owning everything and 99% living in poverty.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the average citizen lost everything—pensions, jobs—while state property was transferred to oligarchs under the leadership of economists from Harvard.

## Economic Warfare and the Dollar

**Georgi Dinkov:** How would you estimate the risk of a third world war? If Russia wins in Ukraine, it throws a major wrench into the West's plans.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Biden is already showing that a Russian victory would make Western rulers insane. The way he talks is pretty insane.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The West also loses credibility. If Russia achieves its goal, it shows the world it is still a great power.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the West sees it as a potentially terminal condition for them, so they will resort to anything to resist that. I think they will start claiming that Russia has committed atrocities all across the country, ignoring that the shelling of the breakaway republics has killed at least 10,000 people over the last seven years.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Russia and China are being pushed together by the Empire. If they come up with an alternative payment system and start trading commodities in something other than the U.S. dollar, isn't that game over for the dollar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The West has seen that coming for years. When the U.S. frozen Russian assets, the Russians had almost equivalent power to retaliate but chose not to punish the West directly; instead, they are shifting their business to China.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Economically, a united Russia and China is essentially checkmate for the West.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is almost unavoidable that China and Russia are going to come out in a functional control position.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the elite wanted the U.S. dollar to go away eventually to replace it with digital currency, do you think this alliance helps their plans, or is it happening too fast?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The dollar is already experiencing a movement away from the petroleum-supported dollar. Moving away from the petrodollar was what got Iraq and Libya murdered; they were introducing a gold-backed finance system. They had to be killed to save the value of the dollar. But they can't do that to China and Russia.

**Georgi Dinkov:** With the war and supply chain disruptions, do you see inflation condensing rapidly in the U.S., perhaps leading to civil unrest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Inflation is already happening because of the actions taken for the pandemic, but it is blending into the world moving away from the dollar. There is nowhere for the dollar to go except losing value faster and faster.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the financial move by the elites will be to introduce Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically, they can control bank access—simply the way Canada confiscated money—and force people quickly into the digital credit card economy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Trudeau invoked emergency powers to do that. What would it take to do that in the U.S.?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It didn't take any law at all to do the illegal mandates. They knew a state of emergency existed. I think we've had a continuing state of emergency for many years, so they can get away with martial law behavior without declaring anything.

**Danny Roddy:** The effect on the food chain is another consequence. Have you been following that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Their expressed policy for several years, starting well before the pandemic, is to phase out the "legacy economy"—small businesses—and destroy them. The mandates forced people to deal with places like Amazon. Jeff Bezos practically doubled his wealth because of the pandemic.

**Danny Roddy:** Doesn't Ukraine export a significant amount of wheat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Russia and Ukraine could find many other markets for their excess production. But they can also turn off exports of rare minerals essential to Western technology.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Russia and Belarus are responsible for two-thirds of the fertilizer used around the world. If they stop exports, nobody grows food at an industrial level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are in a position of tremendous leverage over Europe and the U.S., but they see such actions as leading to military retaliation, so they are very careful about not retaliating yet.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Could you see a cyber attack performed by the CIA being used to sink us into a war situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it could happen anywhere as long as it is convincingly blameable on the Russians. Or not even convincingly—like the virus, it's whatever they say.

## Viruses, Vaccines, and Biology

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A huge false flag operation is likely. They are right at the point of being able to declare a pandemic of Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus. That is one thing that could hold things in a crisis state.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you seen more news on the Marburg stuff? It seems the public can only hold attention on one narrative—either Russia/Ukraine or a new virus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are so in control of the media that they can let out little bits. When one thing slacks in the news, they can cap things up by letting out a new danger.

**Danny Roddy:** People wanted me to ask about the new information regarding reverse transcription. Peter McCullough and others have been talking about proof of reverse transcription of the spike protein in the liver.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yes, a group at MIT and Harvard demonstrated the process happens in cells more than a year ago, but showing it happens in human liver cells is very important.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just by having a feeling for how cells operate, the claim by people like Fauci that introducing RNA would instantly lead to degradation—and that it couldn't possibly be reverse transcribed or enter the nucleus—was textbook molecular biology that ignores reality. Anyone familiar with the actual workings of nucleic acids knows those rules are made for drug companies.

For example, the idea that you have to encapsulate RNA in a lipid membrane to get it into cells is false. The lipid substance is actually designed to act as an adjuvant to stir up the immune system. It has been known for a long time that naked RNA and DNA circulate in our blood. If you add a particular strand, it shows up powerfully inside cells; it can go right through the surface and be incorporated into the nucleus. The so-called principles making this impossible are ignorant fantasies of the pharmaceutical people.

Pharmaceutical researchers actually uncovered that nucleic acids go in and out of cells constantly and exit the organism through body fluids—sweat, saliva, tears, urine. If you condense breath on a cold object, you find nucleic acids. Pfizer knew this; their manual warned people giving the vaccine not to let pregnant women be exposed to someone who was vaccinated. They were fully aware of this shedding process.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you extrapolate on the 5G/graphene oxide theories?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I listened to early reports of the so-called discovery of graphene oxide. They said they would present detailed evidence, but it was never presented. There is junk in the vaccines, and physical particles compatible with graphene oxide, but it hasn't been proven. There were publications proposing graphene oxide for mind control or cell modification via electromagnetic fields, but people blew that up and claimed it had already been done.

## Thyroid Health: T3 and T4 Ratios

**Danny Roddy:** I've been noticing a theme where people are doing significantly better on a 1:2 or 1:1 ratio of T3 to T4, rather than the traditional 1:3 or 1:4. Why would someone do better on a higher ratio of T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are under the influence of something like estrogen, which interferes with liver function and oxygen use—causing a shift to fatty acid oxidation—this wasting of oxygen prevents the conversion of T4 to T3. The conversion requires a certain level of glucose. High-estrogen women frequently have a block between T4 and T3.

In a healthy young man, T4 works almost exactly like T3. In women, it's about 10 times less likely to be adequate because estrogen is a deterrent to conversion. Similarly, men under stress who have done too much aerobic exercise can't get their T3 to come back because factors like aromatase have been activated.

So, if you give a ratio that has enough T3 to keep the oxidative system running, and just enough T4 to fill in when there's a dip in energy availability, that helps. Everyone has their optimal ratio.

**Danny Roddy:** For yourself, can you detect a difference between 1:1 and 1:2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I've never tried resolving it that fine.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I like something closer to 3:1. I'll go along for days with nothing but Cynoplus, but I definitely feel a boost if I bring it up to a 3:1 ratio by supplementing additional T3.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that a seasonal thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The need for thyroid is usually about four times as high in a northern winter as during the summer. For many years, I found that two grains of Armour was just right in the winter, and only half a grain was enough in the summer.

## Heavy Metals and Redox Balance

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to talk about heavy metals. You have a specific perspective including the redox balance, suggesting they are harmful in the context of an overly reduced redox state.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are stressed for oxygen, that will bring up heme oxygenase, which turns heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron. Free iron, in the presence of an oxygen deficiency, is reduced, producing hydroxyl radicals that cause oxidative damage.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the free iron serves as an emergency oxidizing agent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the presence of excess electrons (when oxygen is deficient), the oxygen should be disposing of those electrons. That process should keep iron in a harmless oxidized state. But stress allows electrons to escape and reduce the iron, which then converts things to free radicals.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So supplementing with quinones would essentially protect partially from iron toxicity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that's how many so-called antioxidants work. Inside the cell, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an oxidant, not a reducing agent. If you take so much that you experience a reducing atmosphere, that creates damage. Ascorbic acid functions as a protective factor in the *oxidized* state of the cell. Plant-derived flavonoids work like ascorbic acid as pro-oxidants, helping to deliver electrons and convert the cell into a more oxidized state that protects against free radicals.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Studies show that aside from carcinogenicity, the majority of chronic damage from metals like lead or aluminum comes from increasing oxidative stress. Would the same protective effect be seen with quinones against other heavy metals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen that demonstrated, but I'm sure it's happening.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If someone has heavy metal toxicity, what is your generic approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things like coffee accelerate passage through the kidneys; heavy coffee drinkers were found to have less heavy metal load. Things rich in flavonoids, such as orange juice and grape juice, have a huge protective effect.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But direct chelation is potentially dangerous because it can spread metals all over the body, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So if someone protects against free radical damage with coffee and flavonoids, the body should be able to excrete the excess by its own mechanisms without chelation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Hans Selye did experiments with mercury suggesting that with just the right amount of Vitamin C, you can put the mercury into a harmless valence that passes out of the body.

## Hair Loss, Progesterone, and Altitude

**Danny Roddy:** I thought progesterone was the hair-protective hormone. Why wouldn't just taking progesterone be enough to correct hair loss in a young man?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The estrogen industry has propagandized against progesterone for decades. If it was realized that everything good about female hormones—like protection against heart disease—derives from progesterone, the estrogen industry would suffer.

Regarding hair loss, it has to go with general health, specifically the elimination of factors blocking the hair follicle. That includes good thyroid function, Vitamin D, and adequate calcium. Progesterone combined with Vitamin D, calcium, and thyroid can optimize natural resistance and restore hair growth.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A college buddy of mine lost all his hair by age 22. He moved to a commune in the Tian Shan Mountains in Central Asia, living at about 14,000 feet. He fully regrew his hair and refuses to come back to civilization.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High altitudes have a much lower incidence of all degenerative diseases, including heart disease, dementia, and cancer. I guess you could include premature hair loss as a degenerative disease. Mountain climbers have remarked on the euphoria and sense of well-being they feel at high altitudes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** He says life is more real there. What do you think modern life offers as a benefit that we cannot do without?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never understood why billions of people don't move to the mountains.

**Danny Roddy:** Last thing, Ray. You've said that for hair loss, the intervention has to be proportionate. People often say, "My friend eats poorly and keeps his hair, but I'm losing mine." Is the person losing hair in a more advanced state of aging or stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You've heard of the sign presaging the aging of the circulatory system? Bald people have that at a very high frequency. It is an indication of the likelihood of heart disease developing.

**Danny Roddy:** Why does the circulatory system cause that defect in the hair?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The hair follicle has to produce energy vigorously. If your systemic energy is being blocked, the skin is one of the first places to experience atrophy. You can live with quite a bit of atrophy of your hair, skin, and nails and still keep your lungs and brain working. The brain and blood vessels are protected a lot more than the skeletal muscles and skin against stress and aging.
