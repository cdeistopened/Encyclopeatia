## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat. Guys, thank you so much for joining us today. We're just going to rifle through a bunch of questions, but before we do that, how are you, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Danny Roddy:** The weather has gotten a little bit sunnier in Eugene, so that's always a positive. It's going to be over a hundred this weekend. Do you go sit in the sun or what do you do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I'm going to stay inside all day, tomorrow at least. We open the door at about 1:00 a.m. when it cools off, blow in some cooler air, and then close it up for the day. The house is concrete, so it holds its temperature for about a day.

**Danny Roddy:** And blocking that 5G as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, a little bit.

## Trestolone (MENT) and Androgen Receptors

**Danny Roddy:** Our first question is from Drew. He asks: "Trestolone (MENT) is not 5-alpha reduced, but bodybuilders and some post-finasteride sufferers experience benefits in terms of mood, anabolism, et cetera. Is androgen receptor agonism a likely explanation for the effects? It is a much stronger androgen than testosterone."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Which reduced testosterone is it?

**Georgi Dinkov:** It's a new steroid. It is a 7-alpha-methylated version of nandrolone, which is a carbon-18 steroid of the estrane family. I was always suspicious when they add the methyl group. It's actually very hepatotoxic. As you know, Ray, methyl groups at position 17, 7, and potentially others have all been proven to have severe hepatotoxicity. Bodybuilders like it because it can achieve the same results with lower doses, and they think it's worth it instead of abusing testosterone in higher dosages. That steroid was developed as a male contraceptive candidate, and I think it's still in clinical trials for that. But even the company that developed it got discouraged given the hepatotoxicity. Ray, do you want to clarify the methyl group?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Adding a methyl group to a steroid sends it off on unknown pathways. The liver never had to deal with such things, so I think it's extremely unpredictable and dangerous.

**Danny Roddy:** Is activation of the androgen receptor a plausible explanation of the antidepressant and general feelings of well-being from using these androgenic steroids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's plausible.

## Protocol for Crohn's Disease

**Danny Roddy:** Andrew asks: "What would you do if you had Crohn's? What would be your protocol?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pretty much what I do anyway. Assume that the intestine is my contact with the world and I have to protect it. I don't want to offend it in any way, and Crohn's disease is a seriously offended intestine.

**Danny Roddy:** It seems like you've dealt with a lot of serious intestinal things over the years. Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Starting as a baby with migraines, which recurred every time I would do certain things wrong up until my mid-40s. The last one, for example, was when I was visiting San Francisco and didn't realize that they had fluoridated water. I would occasionally drink some of that water, and I was taking Cynoplus or Cynomel orally. Within two or three days, I had a tremendous migraine. That started me thinking about it; fluoride can totally wipe out the activity of T3 if it happens to be present in your stomach and the T3 is exposed to it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Ray, have you seen some of the more recent studies claiming that Crohn's disease may be caused by a type of mycobacteria, which is known to cause Crohn's disease in animals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but the inflammation and poor digestion set up the conditions for such things to accumulate and multiply. Basically, making sure that you don't irritate your intestine more than absolutely necessary is at the basis of a protocol. You can find a mycoplasma in just about any sick person. It's opportunistic and looks for a place to live.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So maybe this antibiotic therapy that they're now trying in Europe is helping because it's reducing the amount of bacteria in the intestine regardless of the specific type?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just taking a series of penicillin doses or eating raw carrots, for example, can have very similar effects. In both rats and people, it turns out that anything that cleans up your intestine will lower your cortisol and estrogen and increase your progesterone, just because the intestine is such a chronic drain and source of stress.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In regards to the carrot salad and fiber, what are your thoughts on supplementing with pure cellulose if one could find a pure source?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It would be interesting. They used to sell a cellulose tablet for weight loss. I've never tried one, but it seemed like a good idea because cellulose doesn't have the estrogen-promoting symptoms that a lot of other fibers do.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was reading some studies using various cellulose esters as binders for drugs. Some of these esters, like ethyl cellulose, showed remarkable antibacterial effects in animals and reduced inflammation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. It had a very popular laxative effect as well as weight loss. I used to see the ads for it on TV as recently as 1986.

## Cortisol Blockers

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks for good cortisol blocker supplements for weight loss.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone and pregnenolone are the best ones I know of. But working at the pituitary level, a lot of things—sugar, aspirin, probably sodium—anything that stabilizes your blood sugar and metabolism and reduces inflammation will defend you against cortisol.

## Ceruloplasmin and Copper

**Danny Roddy:** There's a question about Morley Robbins' ideas regarding ceruloplasmin. Would you be willing to discuss this from a Ray Peat perspective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant. Is increasing ceruloplasmin a goal of a diet or lifestyle? Not my goal.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If somebody has low ceruloplasmin, some studies claim this is a sign of low thyroid function. In a situation like that, considering ceruloplasmin takes care of copper, would somebody be at risk if they have low ceruloplasmin and low thyroid when eating high copper foods like liver and shellfish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Did you ever read Carl Pfeiffer's books? I think he caused himself to lose pigment by being so obsessive about keeping copper down. He was very concentrated on the risk of too much copper, probably having seen some people with ceruloplasmin deficiency. He took a little capsule of flowers of sulfur every day for many years and had no trace of skin or hair pigment left.

## Nitric Oxide

**Danny Roddy:** Can you speak about nitric oxide and the word on the street that it's good for Cialis or Viagra?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm afraid there is quite a bit of overlap. As soon as nitric oxide was discovered to be produced in the body, they were seeing its involvement in everything degenerative and harmful. Then when Viagra came on the market, suddenly for about five or six years, everything published was how great nitric oxide is—it prevents hypertension and protects you against everything. Thousands of articles came out suddenly reversing it from a dangerous free radical to a cure-all. Then about 10 or 15 years ago, there was a gradual return to sanity, realizing that it's one of the very central things to degeneration, aging, the follow-up of trauma, and estrogen interactions. Everything stress-related and degeneration-related involves the pro-inflammatory effects of nitric oxide.

## Aspirin and Lactose-Free Milk

**Danny Roddy:** Is aspirin safe to take every day, and is lactose-free milk safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lactose-free milk doesn't taste very good, but I think it's safe enough. It probably doesn't let you absorb nutrients quite as well as natural lactose-containing milk, but I don't think it's harmful. Regarding aspirin, when I had a good supply, I was taking it every day very consistently.

## Infertility, Varicoceles, and Aromatase Inhibitors

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks: "I've been trying to have a baby for more than a year but have azoospermia. They found a small varicocele. I've been taking exemestane for three weeks. Will continued exemestane use help me fix the varicocele as well as the azoospermia? I'd like to avoid surgery. After three weeks, my testosterone went from 400 to 756, but FSH and LH increased."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you can get a safer inhibition of aromatase using aspirin, progesterone, and completely safe things. Thyroid is very important. Just with aspirin, progesterone, and thyroid, you can get your ratio back—testosterone and pregnenolone up, and estrogen down. Supplementing pregnenolone and thyroxine historically was very effective for correcting infertility and enlivening inactive sperm.

**Danny Roddy:** So the azoospermia could be a result of high cholesterol and not taking enough thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the thyroid and pregnenolone make their energy-producing system revive.

## COVID Prophylaxis: Ivermectin vs. Alternatives

**Danny Roddy:** Thoughts on Ivermectin for COVID prophylaxis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Prophylaxis suggests you would be taking some every day for an indefinite time. The normal use of Ivermectin is a very short course. About one person in a thousand in the studies of using it to treat parasites will show signs of brain damage. I don't think it's a good idea to take daily doses of something that is known to cause brain damage.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I can give a few alternatives based on recent studies. Methylene blue is a well-known antiviral; at least four studies came out recently saying it can both prevent and treat COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine or plain old quinine—hydroxychloroquine is just a patented, more liver-toxic version of quinine. Naringenin also has good studies, so drinking orange juice should have a similar effect. Aspirin, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D all have studies behind them. Cyproheptadine and famotidine are also options. Ivermectin would be one of the last things I would try considering the safer alternatives.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D is very effective. There was a study done in Spain in a hospital which was withdrawn after doctors wrote ignorant letters, but it was very clear. They gave high doses of Vitamin D to people admitted to intensive care with COVID, and it reduced mortality by about 60%.

## Childhood Hypothyroidism

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks about his 10-year-old daughter with hypothyroid symptoms (low energy, weight gain, digestive problems). Her TSH is between 4 and 5, free T4 around 12. Doctors say she is fine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is very important to get the TSH down. TSH at that level is itself causing pro-inflammatory symptoms and is going to disturb her puberty development. There is no scientific basis for relying on TSH, especially at such very high levels as five.

**Danny Roddy:** It's not crazy to investigate a thyroid supplement for a child, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not at all. Sometimes it has started at a very young age. It's increasingly important around seven, eight, or nine when the first signs of puberty are coming on because the estrogen is going to slow down the thyroid function.

## Thyroid Supplementation and Temperature Dips

**Danny Roddy:** A listener started taking T3 and T4 three days ago and their waking temperature has been slightly lower than usual. Is this normal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very low thyroid people will usually have high cortisol and adrenaline, especially during the night. You should check your pulse at the same time as the temperature. After breakfast with orange juice, the stress hormones decrease. If your temperature and pulse were kept up by high adrenaline during the night, they will drop when you stabilize your blood sugar and metabolism. You are revealing the hypothyroid condition that was hidden under the stress hormones. It's common to have an extreme slowdown when you start thyroid. That's why it's important to chart it for 2-3 weeks; you should see the lines rising steadily towards the goal. If the numbers go down at first, that's evidence that you're getting out of the stress.

## Vaccines and General Immunity

**Danny Roddy:** Why are vaccinated people getting colds and flus right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The purpose of any vaccine is to create a systemic inflammation. In general, that weakens your overall immune system, even though it pumps up your specific antibodies. For example, the year after people have an influenza vaccination, their rate of coronavirus infection was greatly increased—60% more likely to get infected by a different virus because they were protected against influenza.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there truth to the idea that vaccines sacrifice general immunity to boost specific resistance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there were about 10 studies showing that with influenza. The whole doctrine goes back to Ehrlich's time; it's a drug industry-centered theory. Ehrlich proposed a theory ideal for selling "magic bullet" drugs, which was converted to the antibody theory of immunity. Metchnikoff, who shared the Nobel Prize with him, saw immunity as the whole organism maintaining itself. If you follow the antibody theory, logically you need a vaccine for every possible disease.

## Anabolic Steroid Stacks and Health

**Danny Roddy:** If you had to build the most amount of muscle while preserving health, what would you use? A listener asks about testosterone base, Masteron, and low-dose Trenbolone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even with natural testosterone, I think people are generally overdosed. A very healthy young man might produce 4 or 5 milligrams of testosterone per day, so 1 or 2 milligrams well-assimilated should give a tremendous boost. With DHEA, teenage production is 12 to 15 milligrams. By the time a person is 30 or 40, 5 milligrams will bring them up to a normal level.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A younger man clears estrogen much more effectively than an older person. An older person tends to be overloaded with estrogen and cortisol. Simply adding testosterone might not fix the issue if stress hormones are too high. I think bodybuilders overdose because they aren't addressing the thyroid angle and are trying to shut down stress hormones by flooding them with androgens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone. It directly activates protein synthesis, lowers cortisol, and inhibits the effect of cortisol on aromatase.

## Sleep Apnea and Atrial Fibrillation

**Danny Roddy:** A listener has severe sleep apnea induced by atrial fibrillation. He uses a CPAP and wants to get off meds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People using CPAP are almost always hypothyroid and low in progesterone. Thyroid and progesterone correct the problem. Progesterone lowers stress hormones, improves sleep depth, maintains regular breathing, and prevents hyperventilation. The real problem in sleep apnea is cyclic hyperventilation followed by cessation; when you go deficient in carbon dioxide, your breathing stops. Acetazolamide has also been used to treat sleep apnea because it indirectly raises carbon dioxide.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Most drugs on the market for AFib are blood thinners. The flagship drug, Xarelto, was approved by the FDA despite knowledge that the clinical trials were fraudulent. A subsequent trial compared aspirin to Xarelto and found aspirin to be more effective and safer. I think Xarelto may be causing problems, especially with the lowering of carbon dioxide.

## Thyroid Removal and Foot Pain

**Danny Roddy:** A listener's mom is borderline diabetic, had her thyroid removed, and has foot pain.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors likely prescribed thyroxine (T4). In women, thyroxine fails to be activated properly because of estrogen interfering with liver function. Getting on a real thyroid supplement containing T3 is essential when you've had the gland removed.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you feel confident in Armour Thyroid right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't heard any new bad things about it recently. But during the time Armour was being reformulated, I shifted to synthetics like Cynoplus and Cynomel, which have been very reliable for at least 30 years.

## The Cosmic Diet and Entropy

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks about the "cosmic diet" of milk and fruit and if there is an ethical component.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has to do with cosmic entropy. The whole energy concept of existence involves the cephalization process (increasing consciousness and brain development) in all animate beings. It happens that milk and fruits are the simplest and most order-preserving way to integrate your life with the cosmos.

## Benign Tumors

**Danny Roddy:** Does a benign tumor have a similar metabolism to a cancerous one? A listener has a benign osteochondroma.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's quiescent, not inflamed or growing, no, it doesn't have the cancer metabolism. It's just a structural defect. But any inflammation will start having the cancer metabolism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Rubbing progesterone on it may help since it's a fibrotic structure. Older studies called progesterone the most potent anti-fibrotic chemical known.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mechanism involves interfering with estrogen's pro-fibrotic effect. Estrogen, nitric oxide, and serotonin are all blocked by progesterone.

## Gynecomastia

**Danny Roddy:** A listener has gynecomastia on the left breast. Can this be reversed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I just got an email today saying chest fat and gynecomastia regressed thoroughly from taking progesterone. But it's essential to use Vitamin D, thyroid, and anti-aromatase substances like aspirin to keep it under control.

## US Imperialism

**Danny Roddy:** When did the US transform into an empire?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The imperial mentality goes back almost to the beginning—taking the Western US from Mexico, the war against Spain for the Philippines and Cuba. The 20th century has been steady imperialism. There was a temporary let-up with FDR's "Good Neighbor" policy. FDR planned a post-war anti-imperialist policy, but he died just before he could learn that Allen Dulles was committing treason by allying with the German intelligence (Gehlen organization). Immediately upon FDR's death, the Dulles faction took over with single-minded imperialism.

## Erectile Dysfunction

**Danny Roddy:** A listener lost the ability to ejaculate and get an erection over a couple of years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blood tests would be useful to check cortisol, estrogen, DHEA, testosterone, and thyroid.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Sometimes doctors only test testosterone, but studies show you can have ED and fertility problems with normal testosterone if prolactin or estradiol are elevated.

## Heart Rate

**Danny Roddy:** A listener has a heart rate in the low 50s while sitting, but 80s while standing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the sitting rate should be higher than that. Unless you have a really big heart, 50 isn't pumping enough blood to keep things in good health. It's a general sign of hypothyroidism.

## Thyroid Feedback Loops

**Danny Roddy:** Can the thyroid be damaged with exogenous T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you get as much thyroid function as you need, the gland should adjust itself. It's responsive to signals. I've seen my own thyroid gland swell and shrink according to need. When I was taking 50 micrograms of T3, I developed holes in the gland area; when I stopped, it leveled out within 24 hours. Doctors worry about suppression based on adrenal glands, which take a month to recover, but the thyroid recovers very quickly.

## Pregnenolone and Adrenals

**Georgi Dinkov:** Older studies showed pregnenolone decreases 17-ketosteroids. Is that adrenal suppression or just giving them a break?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's supplying the function so they aren't needed. In rat studies, massive doses of pregnenolone caused no endocrine changes except in those under stress—their cortisol went down to normal. Hans Selye found that if he removed adrenals, rats would die from stress. But if he supplemented progesterone, they lived a normal lifespan with no adrenal hormones at all.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think pregnenolone has a direct effect on the pituitary?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the same way any anti-stress substance like progesterone, sugar, or aspirin will stop exaggerated pituitary activity.

## Post-Partum Libido

**Danny Roddy:** A 24-year-old woman has low libido and hot flashes after her second child.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Generally, thyroid is the thing to check. Not getting enough calcium and Vitamin D interferes with mitochondrial energy production regardless of thyroid status. Drinking milk, taking Vitamin D, drinking orange juice, and maybe supplementing thyroid would be the usual approach.

## Anti-Aging and Health Span

**Danny Roddy:** Thoughts on reversing aging and increasing health span?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carbon dioxide is essential for stopping stress and degenerative processes. Vitamin D, calcium, thyroid, and progesterone help optimize the balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Ray, you talk about CO2 as a Lewis acid and partial oxidation. How does its electron-withdrawing function work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the inductive effect. Wherever it's attracted to an electron-rich area, those electrons bulge towards the Lewis acid. This reduces electron availability down the carbon chain. The whole protein molecule shifts towards a relative electron deficiency. Flavonoids from orange juice act similarly. The whole cell turns into an acid—a cooperative electron-deficient condition.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the presence of CO2 and flavonoids would oxidize NADH back to NAD?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Indirectly, by shifting the whole system, activating the electron transport chain, and turning off lactic acid production. It accelerates the flow of electrons. As the flow increases, the electronic pressure decreases (like the Venturi effect). This shifts the cell away from random lipid peroxidation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It sounds like a glass of orange juice and a little Vitamin B1 would be a great anti-aging combination.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, probably a glass of orange juice every few minutes.

## Spike Proteins and ACE2

**Danny Roddy:** Can Ivermectin protect against spike proteins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a safer method would be trying to raise the levels of the ACE2 enzyme. The medical establishment got it backward; things that increase ACE2 and the angiotensin 1-7 fragment are protective.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I found a study showing progesterone directly increases ACE2 levels while lowering ACE. It seems promising for protection.

## Acne Scars

**Danny Roddy:** Any way to get rid of acne scars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's still inflamed, Vitamin E and progesterone applied topically can shut off inflammatory production and restore the tissue.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Studies show a 4% niacinamide solution or a 1% aspirin solution helps reduce scar formation. Combining them might work even better.

## Menstrual Cycle Length

**Danny Roddy:** How do I lengthen my menstrual cycle? It ranges from 23 to 29 days.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Increasing the thyroid level will lower the estrogen, and sometimes that will make it click into a standard 28-day cycle. However, I've never seen bad effects associated with a variation of only 26 to 29 days.

## Progesterone for Men

**Danny Roddy:** Recommendations for a daily progesterone routine for a male in his 30s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't have symptoms, just a drop or two (maybe 5mg) has a protective effect.

**Georgi Dinkov:** We get reports of men taking 20-30mg doing well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes that's enough to shrink a penis temporarily, but for others, because it inhibits conversion of testosterone to estrogen, it's powerfully libido-promoting. It's very individual.

## The "Healing Crisis"

**Danny Roddy:** Do people typically experience negative symptoms (getting worse before better) when reducing endotoxin/cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always doubted that. That's an old medical trick to defend the harm they do. "You have to get worse before you get better." If they cut, burn, or poison you, you're going to get worse first.

## THC and CBD

**Danny Roddy:** How are THC and CBD understood in the bioenergetic view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been looking for real beneficial effects, and it's always very ambiguous. It is sedative and sometimes anti-inflammatory, but not always.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A 2017 study showed pregnenolone can antagonize most of the intoxicating effects of marijuana. If someone uses marijuana heavily, the human equivalent of 30-50mg of pregnenolone seems to block most negative effects.

## Preparedness and Food Storage

**Danny Roddy:** Preparing for "dark days ahead" (supply chain disruptions). What should we store?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having stable calorie supplies and protein. We have a barrel of coconut oil, and it's good to have 20-pound bags of sugar and maybe 40 pounds of gelatin powder.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about "Astronaut food" (powdered eggs/milk)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've wanted a supply of powdered milk, but I'm afraid they use nanoparticles as anti-clumping agents. Evaporated/condensed milk in cans is good to have, and maybe canned sardines.

## Thyroid Supplementation Issues

**Danny Roddy:** A listener gets a lump in the throat and hives from Cynomel/Cynoplus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How fast was it taken? If you try to correct the problem in just a few days, that can cause the gland to shrink so much you get discomfort. With a meal, 10 micrograms of T3 is probably the maximum you want at one time. Otherwise, 5 micrograms. I always chew the tablet.

## Varicose Veins

**Danny Roddy:** A listener heard that pregnenolone/progesterone causes varicose veins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would question the quality of the supplement. Their biological function is the opposite. I've seen bulging veins normalize in an hour with a big dose of progesterone.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It's important to distinguish between varicose veins and veins becoming visible because edema has decreased.

## Weight Loss and Diet

**Danny Roddy:** Any critique on the "Croissant Diet" (high saturated fat, starch)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some experiments show you can increase the metabolic rate by 20% just with sucrose. When done right, sugar is a powerful weight loss instrument.

**Danny Roddy:** Is a 1000-calorie diet effective for short-term weight loss?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't good for your health. Keeping minerals up (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium) is very important to protect against the stress reaction.

**Georgi Dinkov:** They are using RU486 (cortisol blocker) for weight loss now. Can progesterone achieve this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Carefully adjusting thyroid, progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone can sustain a high metabolic rate so you can burn calories much faster.

## Closing Thoughts

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, is there anything specifically interesting happening culturally or medically right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** More kids are dying right after getting vaccinated. I think the public is slowly starting to wake up. People might not tolerate kids dying as much as they would older adults.

**Danny Roddy:** Any thoughts on impending cyber attacks or Big Tech censorship?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's hard to imagine the empire surviving a breakup of the computer industry. It's a totalitarian system. If the internet collapsed, I'm sure I would end up in Mexico. I don't depend on the internet to live a productive life.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It might be a blessing in disguise. People will discover how much they've been duped and might throw away their cell phones.
