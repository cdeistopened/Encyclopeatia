## Introduction: Borders and Civil Liberties

**Danny Roddy:** We're talking about borders. Ray, do you want to back up and rehash the first part of that conversation? That was pretty interesting. I think you mentioned that some federal police, other than the National Guard, were involved in the Portland violence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reporters were aware of the police violence, so they got organized and were keeping careful watch on what the police were doing. The police were arresting reporters. The mayor got involved and got gassed. So the local police themselves were involved, but Homeland Security was probably doing some of the nastiest stuff.

The Border Patrol has no limits on their authority. They can go into your house and search your person, do anything they want without a warrant. That applies to everyone within 100 miles of any border. That means the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Canada, and Mexico. That includes about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Most of the major cities are within 100 miles of the border. So their jurisdiction has just been expanded.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It seems like they do whatever they want. I remember during the Boston bombing, when they were just strolling down the streets and entering people's houses. Do they even have to have a special task force to do that kind of thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They do it anyway, but it just happens that the Border Patrol—the real people working at the borders—can follow you, open your car and documents, and take your equipment or whatever they want to do, as long as they're within 100 miles of the border. Technically it applies all the time to everyone within that massive amount of territory.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I remember during the Boston bombings, they invoked something called "exigent circumstances" to be able to go into people's houses and search for these two bombers. Apparently, under the official rules, if they find something illegal during that search—because it's executed without a warrant and they're technically looking for these two bad people—it's not supposed to be admissible in court.

Guess what happened two weeks after the Boston bombers got caught? Forty-seven people got indicted for growing weed, having ecstasy, or small amounts of pills on their property. All of that was obtained during those searches under exigent circumstances. When the lawyers said, "This is not admissible," the government said, "Oh no, we're invoking national security, so everything is classified. These people are convicted, but you cannot know why." They very much abuse the law any way they want.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are convicting on the basis of secret evidence, having secret laws, and keeping essential documents secret forever, especially when they would incriminate huge numbers of people.

**Danny Roddy:** When you were dealing with Blake College in Mexico and coming back into the States, were you ever harassed by Border Patrol for political reasons?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I was very careful not to have any botanical matter stuck to my clothes. But they would do things like... once I was bringing a little clay flute and they scraped it to see if it was solidified cocaine, and they pried the heels off my shoes.

## Contact Tracing and Surveillance

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, does contact tracing send chills down your spine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No more than the usual awareness of what they're doing without calling it anything special.

**Danny Roddy:** What is contact tracing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If infected people get near someone else, they can follow all of the interacting chains of more or less direct social contacts.

**Danny Roddy:** That requires those people cooperating, right? You have to install something on your phone, or do you think they're tagging people biologically at this point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, if they have a cell phone, they trace them by that. They get the phone company records to find their location. Mostly it's going through cell phone tracing.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think the government is interested in biological tagging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eventually they'll get to that.

## Vaccines, H1N1, and Immune Activation

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, since we last chatted, is there anything that has developed over the last month that should be a central idea? Maybe vaccination, because we're thrusting towards that point. In preparation for that, I was reading about Pandemrix. Do you have any thoughts on that fiasco?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a huge epidemic of narcolepsy in Finland immediately after a vaccination campaign. I imagine that's one of the bases of action against the maker of that particular vaccine. There were several other countries that had epidemics of narcolepsy, but not as big as Finland.

I think one of the things that needs to be done is to get information on the people who were vaccinated for influenza last year in that huge campaign to get old people vaccinated. That would include everyone in the rest homes and convalescent homes, so they would be 100% vaccinated for flu last year.

I've seen studies looking for the effect of flu vaccines on the following year's incidence of influenza. They managed to find a way to claim a certain amount of prevention of flu using very odd methods, but something that came out in all of those studies was a very big increase in the incidence of *other* respiratory infections. Even though they saw a slight decrease in flu, there was a great increase in coronavirus infections. Just looking at those published papers, you would assume that the great mortality from coronavirus was undoubtedly increased by the fact that they were probably 100% vaccinated for flu just a few months earlier.

If you look at "immune activation" on PubMed, you'll find lots of studies on the damaging effects of basically any kind of immune activation—meaning activating an inflammatory process. If it happens during pregnancy, such as either a bacterial or viral infection occurring naturally, or a flu vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant, any activation of the immune system during pregnancy has very great long-term, lifelong effects on the fetus. The next generation will have depression and all kinds of after-effects. Cognition is one of the major themes of the degree of immune activation. The number of pathogens you've been exposed to corresponds negatively to mental ability.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen people with Gulf War Syndrome, Ray? When they give interviews, they look like they're about to fall asleep and many of them suffer from narcolepsy. Do you think serotonin is somehow involved in that symptomatology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. Whatever they were exposed to, including twenty vaccines just to go there.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what can we learn from the H1N1? Do you think that was a failed attempt to do what they're doing now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Maybe 10 years ago, not as many things were put into place like they are now. For example, Gates is intertwined with not only the vaccines, but also the identification and the contact tracing. Clearly, there's a big spider web of things that had to be in place before something of this magnitude could be employed.

**Danny Roddy:** Are you familiar with the 1976 swine flu outbreak?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At the time, the propaganda was that they had identified it as the same as the 1918 influenza outbreak that supposedly killed 50 to 100 million people. In 1918, people had no idea what the cause of influenza was; they thought it was bacterial. On the basis of finding a few frozen corpses and finding this coronavirus or flu virus in them—I think it was H1N1—they declared that was the cause of the 1918 epidemic. The science of the 1918 pandemic was even worse than the present science.

The man in charge of evaluating influenza vaccines in 1976 was telling his bosses that the vaccines were going to cause more harm than good because the virus always mutates ahead of any vaccine. He went public with his information that there was no safety data and lots of harm documented. He got fired, and they went ahead with the production of the vaccines. They killed a lot of people, paralyzed hundreds, and paid off a large amount of money to the injured. But there never was an H1N1 or swine flu epidemic at all in the United States in 1976.

## 5G, DNA, and Viral Synthesis

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the recent study that came out about 5G electromagnetic fields potentially capable of inducing the organism to synthesize the coronavirus *de novo* without any external infection? That would be in line with Montagnier's experiments with the virus acting as an antenna and transmitter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The study is by three physicists and two doctors from the Guglielmo Marconi University in Italy. It seems to be peer-reviewed. They described a mechanism where, because the 5G electromagnetic waves are of such a short wavelength, they can get inside cells. The cells act as antennas and the DNA acts as an inductor. The movement these waves induce in the DNA causes certain gaps to appear in the cell. Apparently, the cell tries to plug that gap and produces RNA that is indistinguishable from the RNA of the coronavirus. Does that sound feasible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was taking developmental biology, someone accidentally put in a publication from around 1940 in which they were exposing cells to foreign protein and then reproducing several generations of the exposed cells in culture. They found that the cells were emitting copies of the protein they had been exposed to. That was a perfect demonstration that a cell can perceive a very different molecule that it presumably could not possibly have DNA for. After ten or more generations of cell division, it was still producing very measurable amounts of this foreign protein.

That indicated that cells have an apparatus for copying a protein, transforming the information from the sequence of the protein into a sequence of DNA or RNA, and then reading out endless copies of a protein indistinguishable from the one it was exposed to. I commented on that paper, and then it disappeared from the file. I think it disappeared from the whole library because someone had accidentally included it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So under the same principle, we could be producing HIV endogenously, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's Montagnier's argument on why he's banned and went to China to work.

## RNA Vaccines and Angiotensin

**Danny Roddy:** In your estimation, how much more dangerous is something released for coronavirus going to be than even the narcolepsy-inducing Pandemrix?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This will be the first RNA vaccine. I think the people who are making it are probably totally unaware that our cells have lots of reverse transcriptases. We're just waiting for a bit of foreign RNA to come in to make copies and send it into our genome as permanent DNA. Then our great-great-grand-descendants will be able to make the most toxic spike protein part of the virus in uncontrolled quantities.

The whole story of the spike protein is the key to making the virus infectious for humans. All the studies of the last 10 or 15 years have been working on perfecting that spike protein so it fits a human ACE2 enzyme. ACE2 is the enzyme that detoxifies angiotensin—it destroys our basic inflammation and blood pressure-raising peptide.

The danger of having a lot of coronavirus is simply that it creates inflammation by knocking out our intrinsic defense against angiotensin. That fact has been covered up or ignored. They say inflammation of the lungs is what you have to think about, but when you knock out ACE2, you're creating systemic inflammation. Inflammation of the bowel creates systemic inflammation. So the whole thing is the turning on of the angiotensin system.

I found a recent publication, C. Toelzer et al., showing that the final step in forming the active binding site of the spike protein requires the binding of linoleic acid, which it finds on the cell surface if the person has been eating their vegetable oil regularly. The more linoleic acid you have floating around in your system, the more likely the virus is to be activated and successful in sticking to you and causing inflammation. That has only been published in abstract form so far. I'm afraid it isn't going to make it much farther because of its implications for nutrition.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, if you were an evil maniac working in a lab, is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system something to target to produce incredibly negative effects in a wide variety of people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It exists in everyone and every cell. Mast cells in any tissue can make renin, and then local converting enzymes can convert the renin into the series of angiotensin peptides. It's a local inflammation promoter. It's a universal thing, more basic than nitric oxide, estrogen, or serotonin. It closely relates to those and turns them on. It's an activator of aromatase, for example. It activates this explosion of all kinds of inflammation promoters, cytokines, and so on. If you can knock out the enzyme that destroys that, you've created the most destruction with the least effort.

## Exosomes and Cell Intelligence

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the body is exposed to foreign DNA/RNA from viruses or vaccines and internalizes them, and then under stress starts shedding retroviruses, does it do so haphazardly? Or does it pick out specific things to deploy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's regulated by a very ultra-organized system—that antenna we were talking about. There is a website called "Cell Intelligence" by Albrecht-Buehler. He gives his argument that the cell knows how to call up exactly the genes it wants by such things as the antigen it's exposed to. The cell has a reading system like a super librarian that knows where to find everything specifically.

The normal use of the system that reads out retroviruses is likely the same system that produces exosomes. These are part of a repair and maintenance system. They form particles that are almost indistinguishable from the coronavirus under a microscope. For example, if you have injured lung tissue that needs repair, it composes exosomes by drawing out just the RNA, DNA, and proteins needed for repair. It puts them into the bloodstream, and they travel to the bone marrow.

These exosomes are taken up by bone marrow cells, causing them to differentiate into a pre-lung cell—not quite a stem cell, but differentiating towards becoming a lung cell. They are then excreted back into the bloodstream. Because it's already on the pathway to becoming lung tissue, it is recognized and sticks to the region where it's needed. It's a very powerful, specific, intra-body communication system between stem cells and injured cells.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, these viruses that we're internalizing are like tissue-specific alarm signals that can be called upon for help when needed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Random stuff getting added to that system is going to have the potential to change our course of development.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there any limit on the amount of external DNA/RNA material that the body can internalize?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the body probably has various filters, but a lab in Germany has published many papers showing that the DNA in our foods can be found in our cells. So there is quite a bit of uptake even from our foods. Autopsies on women who have had two or three husbands have demonstrated DNA from husbands one and two, as well as the most recent one, in her tissues—including brain tissue. She's putting away and storing the semen DNA.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is that the principle that explains telegony?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's similar to xenia, and specifically I think it would be telegony.

## History, Conspiracy, and Information Control

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, how did you learn about the "powers that be"—the DuPonts, Morgans, Rockefellers—before the internet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Up until right after World War II, people used to talk a lot. A lot of it was personal experience. There was a lot of mimeographed underground stuff going around. People who were curious could get a fairly good picture of what the government was doing in medicine, for example.

When I first went to the University of Oregon in 1956, I went as an English major, but I found anthropology and biology more interesting. I read lots in those areas. Ten years later, I went back to the library looking for those books. None of the most interesting ones were there anymore.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think you can talk about health without addressing these political investigations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Health involves interaction with the environment, air, food, information, the medical system, and various sources of poisoning. Immediately, as soon as you think about a symptom and what doctors do about it, you're involved in politics.

It starts with the suspicion that things aren't what they're said to be. In 1945, on the radio, Harry Truman said, "We have just dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a military base." I started thinking about that and found out Hiroshima was a big city. Later, every anniversary, they would repeat Truman's announcement, but that phrase was deleted.

I started doubting and looking for background information every time Eisenhower would talk. I started seeing what an immense web of corruption Eisenhower was involved in. Money was flowing from the oil industry and hydroelectric industry to buy his support. Senator Wayne Morse started investigating that corruption.

**Danny Roddy:** The manipulator's ability to "memory hole" information is astounding. John Oliver recently did a show on conspiracy theories, arguing that "nobody can keep a secret."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even when the secret is out and 100 or 500 people know it, the mass media can keep everyone else—everyone that counts—from knowing it. Just this last week, someone I had lost touch with for 55 years, Luis Urias, got in touch. We're starting to put together experiences from things related to the government shutting down Blake College. Luis thinks important historical information will come out of several of us putting together what the government was doing there.

You have to document the validity of the documents themselves because those are very often forged. Just destroying them is the first thing, but they have done lots of very convincing forgeries. Almost all of 20th-century history regarding Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union is based on forgeries as far as American historians are concerned.

## Civilization, Decline, and Regeneration

**Georgi Dinkov:** In a previous interview, you said civilization's best chance of escaping is somewhere in Western Latin America. Would you say it's justified to say civilization is in a process of decline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. As the empire and the ecology decline, the civilization is being taken down with it. The CIA did a great job on degrading civilization throughout the world with their Congress for Cultural Freedom in 1950, with their action art, abstract expressionism, and so on.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Can evolution go in reverse? Can society revert to a more primitive structure, like a "social cancer"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The picture that is imposed is a digitized view of the substance we're made of. It comes down to quanta. It is reductionism made into a universal philosophy of being, which necessarily extends into a particular philosophy of individualism. Margaret Thatcher's idea was that society doesn't exist; it's only the quanta that make up the personality.

The concept of long-range order in the cell, which is necessary for these antenna functions or cell intelligence, doesn't exist in that view. The digitizing of ethics, politics, and education is part of the deep degradation. If you see the substance we're made of as digitized, then our consciousness is ultimately like computer consciousness—meaningless fragments of on/off signals.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think nature will tolerate a reversion to a barbarian level, or will it collapse and rebuild?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are reasons for thinking a threshold has been passed. If we don't establish an energetic, functional society, regeneration might not be possible. However, there is evidence suggesting that melting tundra and subterranean methane clathrates could release vast amounts of carbon dioxide. A gigantic increase in CO2 would change mental function, knock out inflammatory degenerative diseases, increase the growth of forests, and allow the reconstruction of much of what has been destroyed.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think large numbers of people can live in a peaceful, structured society?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With a population of this size, it's going to take organization beyond individual family farms. It would take cooperative farms to use land efficiently. I think there's plenty of productive land if people can form cooperative groups.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is the most anti-civilization factor humans have come up with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Militarism is the first.

**Danny Roddy:** What about grain agriculture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To restore the productivity of the land, it's going to take diversification—getting more trees to create water retention, soil retention, cool the summers, and level the rainfall. The buffalo and the grass were a stable soil-preserving system. Restoring forests would be a big step.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would the optimal food supply look like?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As many perennial plants as possible. Trees producing fruits, so there isn't a constant plowing up and waste of energy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about seafood?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There isn't as much of it as people used to think. It's very easy to deplete. Abolishing the fish oil industry and the conversion of fish into pet food and fertilizer would help the oceans regenerate.

**Georgi Dinkov:** With that mode of production, will populations naturally shrink?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's a natural tendency when insecurity has been the main driver of population increase. As soon as a population gets a modest degree of social security, they stop having too many kids.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The Malthusians insist they need more authoritarianism to control population.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea of a basic guaranteed national income is going to be a kind of social security that lets people do what they're interested in. That will remove the need to worry about who's going to support them in old age.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think that goes back to the roots of what makes us human—cooperation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Kropotkin said if you look at nature all the way from bacteria up, cooperation is our basic instinct. There have been only a few authoritarian political theorists who have promoted the Randian "tooth and claw" idea of nature.

## Marxism, History, and Ideology

**Danny Roddy:** Some listeners say, "Ray is a genius about nutrition, but out of touch with politics." Can you address the view that Communism/Marxism is horrific?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good place to start is by looking at a criticism of the major American historians of the Soviet Union. We have a falsified history of Trotsky just as much as Stalin. Trotsky's connections to the US and Hitler have almost totally been eliminated.

For example, the Ukrainian famine is called genocide, where Stalin is accused of creating the famine. But the US, immediately after WWI, started collaborating with Germany on biological warfare. One of Germany's advances was a fungus that kills wheat plants called wheat rust blight. Stalin's agronomists saw a bumper crop coming, but when it came time to harvest, the seeds were destroyed by the blight—something Germany and the US had been working on.

A historian named Grover Furr has done a series of books. A good one to start with is *Khrushchev's Lies*. He documents fabricated documents and mistranslations used by major American historians.

**Danny Roddy:** What is your definition of Nazism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hitler and his people were aware of public relations. There was a threat that Germany would be taken over by the socialists. So Hitler said, "We're going to be the best socialists of all." He got the support of the left, but with the knowledge of the corporations and banks that he was using the language of progressivism to enslave the people. He said, "It isn't the capitalists, it's only the Jewish capitalists." He was the agent and mouthpiece of the banks and giant industrialists.

**Danny Roddy:** Would we be better off if our system was replaced by Communism tomorrow?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it would automatically be just as rotten a swamp of communism as it is of so-called democracy.

## Ray's Travels and Lysenko

**Danny Roddy:** We heard you went to the Soviet Union on a boat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I went on a student boat. It cost $200. We took a train through Russia. I wanted to talk to Lysenko, but he wasn't there. I got to talk to the biomagnetism man, Yuri Holodov. He gave me a very good list of books.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What led to the downfall of Lysenko?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Khrushchev supported Lysenko for a while, but when Khrushchev went out, that was the end of Lysenko's career. Lysenko represented the truly materialist approach to reality. Western genetics theory represents the imposed rationalist, reductionist approach.

Lenin said knowledge is composed of memory, but memories are recordings of experience, and experience is always new. The source of experience is matter. So materialism means looking to the future and the possibilities of experience. Western genetics tries to base rationalism on pre-existing ideas.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the working class is the potential producing progress, and the ruling class is the memory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The ruling class wants to solidify this memory into an eternal Platonic thing that can't be tampered with. That's where the computer ideology comes from.

## Aristotle, Imprinting, and Intelligence

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asked how you can talk about Aristotle when he wrote about "natural slavery."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He did so many things right. He was much less authoritarian than Plato. Aristotle was a source for much of the good thinking of the medieval philosophers. Lenin picked out these good, developmental, future-oriented parts of Aristotle.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think preference for idealistic theories indicates prenatal stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's part of the imprinting process. It goes with the quality of breastfeeding. If the mother is anxious, the baby starts seeing objects as threats. This develops into the preference for things that aren't wiggly and changeable—timeless objects.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In regards to intelligence, police departments and the military are allowed to discriminate against people who score too high on IQ tests. Do you think the IQ test has merit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That principle has been in practice in graduate schools too. They don't like critics. High IQ people used to be dangerous critics, so they were flunked out. The power structures currently select for stupidity rather directly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there any way to predict criminality via IQ?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a quote from Neil Brickham: "The CIA is a socially acceptable way of expressing criminal tendencies." There is evidence that people who choose to go into police departments are biased in that direction.

## China and the Future

**Georgi Dinkov:** What is your opinion of China?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Their empire is based on capitalism now. Eric Schmidt's National Defense Commission on Artificial Intelligence described the need to destroy the present economy so we can go directly to AI and get there faster than China. It's definitely what the World Economic Forum has in mind—to get rid of middle-level free enterprise and go directly to automation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you foresee a union between the US and China?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** World capital is deeply involved in Chinese production. It's close to the picture that China will do the economy, the US will do the weapons, and Africa will provide raw materials.

## Closing Thoughts

**Danny Roddy:** What is your prediction for the election?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's most likely going to be the installation of Biden. The real powers are going to do anything necessary to get Biden in.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think there's any country attempting to embark on the right path?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are little opposition countries. Iran has its good points. Venezuela and Cuba are doing lots of good things. Libya under Gaddafi had big plans to break out of the dollar economy. Small countries that try to break out are a good possibility for stopping the deterioration.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on at the moment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been having computer problems, but I'm about to write about education.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I hope his newsletter will talk about how the dream of Ivan Illich is coming true.

**Danny Roddy:** Thank you, Ray. Thank you, Georgi.
