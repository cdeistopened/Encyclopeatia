---## Introduction: Energy, Structure, and Environment

**Danny Roddy:** I loved your quote, "Without a realistic view of where you are, you can't expect to go anywhere." I thought of not only optimizing the environment, but also thinking about how you formed as an individual from your early life to now. A lot of times I'll be talking to somebody and they'll say, "My health problem started a year ago," or "It started two years ago." Then you talk to them more and realize things have been happening their whole life, unraveling this relationship with stress.

Going through your work, I highlighted *aromorphosis* from the evolution of the biosphere—the general idea of energy inducing complexity. I also highlighted Le Chatelier's principle of restoration and disturbed equilibrium. I looked into György Csaba's view of hormonal imprinting as a point of reference. From there, I looked at the precautionary principle of modifying the environment and trying to erase the imprints to maintain a good sense of euphoria. I love that quote by José Ortega y Gasset, who says, "I am myself plus my circumstances."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Pavlov, everyone seems to end up at that point, realizing that you can't separate yourself as something separate from your circumstances.

**Danny Roddy:** In your newsletter, you were just talking about progesterone being this main substance guiding the development of the individual.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the thing that holds you together while you respond in an energetically directional way. The progesterone prevents the energy from disintegrating you. It's one of the most powerful stabilizers. Carbon dioxide has a similar structurally stabilizing effect. That creates the unified system which can respond in a unified and directional way.

**Danny Roddy:** If something is interfering with the general energy production or the steroids, is that when the structure becomes imperfect? Le Chatelier's principle—that a system adjusts in ways which restore a disturbed equilibrium—is behind this idea. Every part of the flow can be seen as a disequilibrium, and the complexification of the structure tends to absorb the disturbing energy. So the more energy, the more complex.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We're always having a flow of energy. That flow itself is disturbing the equilibrium, and it's tending to absorb energy and turn it into structure. Anytime you flow energy through a system, it is creative and creates structure. Structure is always going to form, but it has the option to take on different shapes according to the shape of the stress that you're putting on the system.

There's a young physicist, Jeremy England, who has been demonstrating that the universe isn't controlled by the second law of thermodynamics. He says that if you start with a random clump of atoms and shine light on it long enough, it shouldn't be surprising that you end up with a plant. That is basically restating what Vernadsky said: that the sun generates large-brained animals.

In Jeremy England's phrase, if you create a plant by shining light on random atoms, and if you shine enough bright light, you'll eventually get large-brained mammals because the ordering principle of a directed flow of energy is going to create complexity. Whatever the surrounding conditions are where you're disturbing the equilibrium, it's going to conform to those boundary conditions. It will take a shape responding to everything in the environment, but it's the flow of energy which is responsible for the growing complexity.

## Society, Competition, and Cooperation

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, I had sent you an older quote of yours that said, "I came to see literary periods or styles—classical, realist, romantic, surrealist, et cetera—as reflections of a society's energy and structure." That got me thinking. So many people say things like, "I would like to shape the world in this point of view," or "I would like this system." Given that quote and the idea behind energy complexifying forests as a general rule of nature, I wondered how much of this is even within our control? How much should I even worry about it if the Earth's metabolism or the universe's metabolism is guiding the direction of everything?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The natural tendency of things—to have dinosaurs grow up to a huge size and then mammals come in and grow bigger brains—those are guided by the surrounding competitive innovations of matter. The sun and the internal energy of the Earth are supplying the streaming energy, and the particular shape that things take is a reflection of who else is around absorbing that energy.

So plants come up, and if the Earth is warm, the plants will make not only carbohydrates but saturated fats. The expanding brains of the contemporary animals eating those plants with saturated fats will thrive, integrating the saturated fats into their brain. But if for some reason the big brains move into a cold climate and eat plants that are defending against freezing, they'll start ingesting polyunsaturated fats into their brain. Their brains will suffer and be limited in proportion to how much of the cold climate polyunsaturated fats get into their brains. That creates accelerated aging and lots of other problems.

If everyone had stayed put, we might have just been on a straight line to a very happy, big-brained population eating nice tropical oily fruits. But besides going off into very inhospitable environments at the poles, under those tense circumstances, people started exploiting each other. Instead of having a more or less egalitarian situation in a favorable climate, they started getting competitive and creating control situations where some people would work as slaves so that a few people could have a better life.

The authoritarian, warlike, sadistic cultures reflect the distorting power of scarcity, natural scarcity, and natural competition. If those populations survive, they tend to conquer and become dominant. As they become a unified authoritarian civilization in the temperate zones, they will create ideologies that justify what they're doing—ideologies of caste systems, slavery, and competition. You'll come up with the idea of "survival of the fittest." Then, applying those ideas, various forms of education, advertising, and indoctrination will expand and complexify those authoritarian exploitative processes.

**Danny Roddy:** So it altered the course of human history by singing the praises of competition and making an institution out of it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Danny Roddy:** I reread Stephen Jay Gould's *Kropotkin Was No Crackpot*, and I've been reading more about cooperation in general. I think a lot of people have a knee-jerk reaction to it; they think it's a utopian hell when you say "cooperation." My friend Eric Lépine translated an article from Raoul Vaneigem, and a phrase that stuck out to me was the question: "How do we reconcile the greatest individual liberty possible while preserving the greatest equality within a community?" He called this a fundamental political paradox. Do you think it is a paradox, and what does cooperation look like on a grand scale?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's just a matter of being able to step back from the culture. In one of these authoritarian societies, when someone steps back and questions, they tend to get kicked out and have to go look for some other tribe to belong to because the authoritarians don't tolerate questioning and opposition. They indoctrinate everyone that competition is good, but they do everything to eliminate competition. The ideology of the United States has been "competitive free enterprise," but the basic business reality has been the elimination of competition—using government whenever possible to eliminate the competition, but also forming non-competitive, anti-competitive economic organizations.

## Ethics, Government, and Structural Violence

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, I know you've written favorably about Stalin, Lenin, Marx, and the general idea of communism. I was curious if you thought those terms or people's ideas were being misrepresented or perverted in some way? In the news, you hear terms like "cultural Marxism" or people talking about Stalin as being the worst person on the planet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 65 years ago, I saw a book called *Communism and Christianity*. I don't recall who wrote it, but it observed that Marx's basic ideas apparently came from Christian ethics. If you take Christian ethics seriously, then you start thinking like Marx, or at least the anarchists or communitarians of the 19th century. You think, "If those ethics are valid, what can we do to observe them?"

**Danny Roddy:** Can you get into more of the ethics? I feel like people play semantics a lot of times here.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the "do unto others" ethic, and then you look without a Darwinian bias... Darwin believed that everything English was superior—that English plants would displace other species when transplanted, the way the "superior" Englishmen would displace other races. If you can get away from that fairly psychotic view of biology and actually look at the behavior of squirrels, mice, or birds, they are all aware of their surroundings and are inclined to be altruistic and benevolent, not destructive and aggressive. Aggression is a very peculiar and unusual part of behavior in most species. When their intelligence is allowed to act, they make it obvious that they are experiencing empathy, even with different species, but especially with their own.

**Danny Roddy:** Just to play devil's advocate, sometimes people say that when the complex apparatus of the US government tries to intervene—like using welfare to help people—it becomes a nightmare situation. Do you think that's accurate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is just a story that has been invented to put down the do-gooders. There have been people supported by big corporations and governments to write popular stories and make movies to illustrate that. Ronald Reagan got his ideology from some of these political fictions that promoted an anti-Dickens approach to society.

**Danny Roddy:** I was watching a conversation between Webster Tarpley and a libertarian, and Webster was explaining how if you cut food stamps, you basically have a genocide on your hands. It was the idea of the government being the problem, but if you get rid of the government programs, you're immediately in a worse position.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you do that, a bunch of corporations will disappear, and rich people will be desperate to find a new way to undo that, because the corporations are constantly being defended by government power. Police and armies are there to make the corporate ruling class stable and secure. They talk about welfare keeping people from starving, but it's the government keeping them poor that creates the starvation by following the rules of whatever the corporations want to write into the economic system. Every aspect of the culture has been designed to favor corporate exploitation. Poverty expands in proportion to the power of corporations over government. The story that people need welfare to prevent starvation is a very downstream part of the story. First you create the starvation, and then you decide whether to alleviate it slightly.

**Danny Roddy:** I've been reading about structural violence. James Gilligan defines structural violence as the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those above them. He attributes these excess deaths to stress, shame, discrimination, and the denigration resulting from lower status. Do you think that's a worthwhile concept?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. Just look at the rules regarding corporations and labor unions. Unions have very restrictive things they can do collectively. Corporations now have absolutely no restrictions; they can spend whatever they want controlling political information. Just removing the organizational rules built into the system would make a tremendous difference. The whole structure is there for the purpose of exploitation, and the alleviation of suffering is just a way of preventing hysterical uprisings here and there.

**Danny Roddy:** If people were to rise up and oppose the imposed systems, is violence sometimes necessary, or is it always vile?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When Martin Luther King said that white people are being exploited and sent to kill foreigners for the good of the corporate class, that was very antagonistic to the military and corporate factions and led to his being killed. Anytime someone suggests even moderate approaches to changing the system, they suffer violence. They don't have to propose violence. He was absolutely against violence from either side, but no matter how much you advocate nonviolence, you're going to experience it if you do anything that threatens the system.

## Hormonal Imprinting and Health

**Danny Roddy:** Stepping back a little, can we talk about hormonal imprinting? The basic idea is a cellular protein binding to certain substances while they have an effect on other cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** György Csaba, who has done so much research on hormonal imprinting, has evidence showing that the receptor is created specifically for what the cell is experiencing. That reminds me of a study from the 1930s I saw in a developmental biology seminar. Someone had presented a protein to a culture of bacteria, then removed the protein, washed the bacteria, treated them with an enzyme to break down the protein, washed them again, and cultured them. Large amounts of that same protein kept appearing in the culture, strongly showing that the bacteria had learned to copy a foreign protein. After I mentioned that and went back to make a copy for myself, the article had disappeared from the box. Someone cleansed the document box.

**Danny Roddy:** These systems are imposed on us and we're being actively harmed. Csaba mentioned serotonin frequently as being a switch back to the primitive metabolism, having a profound effect on our perception of ourselves and the world. What is your general thinking on erasing these imprints and maintaining euphoria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Euphoria consists of a balance in which structure is at least maintained by the flow of energy. It's only in that state where you can advance to increase your structure and perfection. If you are far from the euphoric condition, it means you're basically degenerating structurally—aging and deteriorating. Maintaining the euphoric state is therapeutic. That's what happens when you eat progesterone, take active thyroid (T3), pregnenolone, sugar, or breathe the right amount of carbon dioxide. Everything that doesn't cause injury and does cause energy or stability is going to lead you towards a greater stability.

**Danny Roddy:** Besides thyroid, pregnenolone, DHEA, progesterone, testosterone, cholesterol, vitamin D, and sugar, is there anything you're very concerned with? EMF, air quality, water quality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The estrogenic toxins in the water are a major thing, but the corruption of the food supply is probably the most important for the most people. The miseducation of people to think that vegetable oil is better than butterfat, and to think that complex carbohydrates are good or sugars are bad. It's a perversion of the government intervention to help poor people survive in the Great Depression. They said, "Here are beans and grains that are very cheap," but by the 1970s, they were saying even middle-class people should eat these for their health.

**Danny Roddy:** One of my favorite quotes from you regarding trauma is: "Nothing is stored. It's like the pasts are all present in the same room and we periodically have a different perspective on them. When the present balance of stuff—toxicants, euphorians, etc.—is good, you can think and feel what you want to about things."

If somebody had a very traumatic childhood or event, is there any therapy you think is especially useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think even the big traumas are processed in the same way. Everyone is massively traumatized by being born into Europe or America. Having a deformed body part or an intense emotional experience are fairly minor compared to the big framework that is institutionalized traumatism. Look at Gabor Maté and how well he turned out after surviving Nazism.

**Danny Roddy:** He's incredible. I don't know of anybody as articulate as him on these topics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He wasn't harmed permanently by terrible experiences. Everyone who survived had the possibility of realizing those same forces are around us all the time and we have to constantly overcome them.

## Curiosity, Language, and Consciousness

**Danny Roddy:** In Ernest Schachtel's book *Metamorphosis*, he discusses how the drive to explore is strongest in childhood. As mammals mature, we see a slackening of this curiosity, and the open world turns into a variety of objects of use. I think of you as a good example of someone who has maintained that excitement. Do you see it similarly to Schachtel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. I think it's the language culture—the language bearing the story they are trying to indoctrinate us with—that turns adults away from exploration and innovation. The reason I got interested in studying linguistics was that from puberty, I started experimenting with language and the actual machine of my consciousness. For 65 years, I've been experimenting with how to separate myself from the English language, and language in general, to see the processes of consciousness.

That's what Kropotkin couldn't avoid seeing when he studied nature. If you really watch animals, you see they are behaving more intelligently than most people we read about. I've watched ants and birds; each is an individual and very communicative. People create the illusion that communication happens through words, whereas basic communication is being aware of where you are. Language is often a way of making people less conscious rather than actually communicating. It tends to reinforce indoctrinated patterns and suppress the urge to explore.

**Danny Roddy:** Is this one of the reasons you do sculpting, painting, and music? To turn off the language?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And just paying attention to sleep. That's what your consciousness machine is doing for you. For Pavlov, the cortex of the brain was an interface between everything happening in the world and everything happening inside your body. It's a constant adjustment. If you step out of the language culture, you come in contact with your cerebral cortex, which is an interaction between your kidneys, pancreas, intestine, heart, and everything around you. You select the part of your past that you think will be useful for what is to come.

**Danny Roddy:** On days you do more arts and less reading, do you notice an effect on your dreams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. Everything affects the dreams—hormones, sugar, etc.

**Danny Roddy:** If someone wasn't dreaming at all or having nightmares, would that be a feature of hypothyroidism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Deep sleep doesn't necessarily involve dreams. If something is disturbing you, you will try to work it out in the dreams, just as you work things out in reality. When the dream catches some emotional energy, if you can remember that and become conscious with it, the dream can make the emotional energy available to you during the day to work out parts of reality.

**Danny Roddy:** Is dreaming part of the innate animal intelligence as opposed to the cultural caricature we look through during the day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the animal intelligence is always there offering itself, and our daily cultural consciousness is distracting us from watching. I see it like a set of projectors working with resources from inner body senses and stored images. The body is projecting possibilities, trying to bring them to your attention. But ordinarily, the consciousness that tries to handle those intrinsic body deliveries tends to stop the process or deform it. A passive attitude towards watching what your body is trying to do is similar to watching what ants or birds are trying to express. Treat your body as if it was a bit of nature and watch what it's trying to tell you.

**Danny Roddy:** It's funny you mention a passive approach. I always felt I had an aggressive "salt the earth" approach, treating every problem like a nail.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can have a tremendous amount of energy in the passivity, but it's passivity in relation to the fictional character—the role society tells us to play. If you detach yourself from that cultural self, then the passivity actually gains energy so that you can appreciate the full intensity of the problem you're confronting.

**Danny Roddy:** Besides the arts, is there anything else that fosters those feelings? Avoiding the news?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Being around people who are open to consideration of actual parts of reality. I think a very powerful part of our nervous system is how we feel ourselves resonate with other people. If you have a random clump of people, the natural process of resonance is going to create interesting things. There's more freedom to become yourself when you can resonate with other people. For example, brain cells isolated in a culture dish start vibrating together; they learn to act like a brain. If you put people together without pressure and demands from the outside, they will come up with solutions.

## Social Organization and Education

**Danny Roddy:** Tolstoy said that everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself. Do you think focusing on yourself creates a ripple effect in society?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The culture has taught people that the "self" they need to concentrate on is this fictional role, like their caste or social position. Realizing that the culture telling you who you are is also killing you is an essential starting point. You want to be able to get together with other people who are aware of the hostile nature of our bigger society.

**Danny Roddy:** So it's essential to have a group to put ideas into action?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The traditional ways of organizing are now being monitored so carefully that they can shoot them down the moment they start to take effect. The wariness of the culture is the most infectious thing that can precede organization. If the recognition that medicine is mostly harming people and that the foods are leading to an early diseased death spreads, that suspicion and rejection of the system is what can precede the actual search for what to do next. The ultimate goal should be something on the order of "gathering culture"—having such a fruitful environment that we can just pick what we need.

**Danny Roddy:** You said in an article that deleting medicine, the legal system, and education were three things that would move in a good direction.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government and corporations are enforcing those things. Ivan Illich studied how medicine and schooling are enslaving people. One of the worst aspects of schooling he identified was the compulsory need to be taught—disengaging somebody's autonomy.

When I first went to college, I came across a professor who was teaching five different departmental subjects: comparative religion, contemporary philosophy, German literature, English literature, and others. He was an excellent teacher in everything. I saw a letter he received from a dean at Harvard inviting him to teach literature there, but he didn't want to be limited. The fact is, when you can teach a subject other than what you've been taught specifically, you're going to teach that subject probably better than someone who has been drilled in it for 10 years.

**Danny Roddy:** I would regularly encounter people in San Francisco that studied medicine, and I could never have a normal conversation with them. Wasn't it Marx who thought that there were many different aspects of a person and that you weren't just one thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Gabor Maté was an English major. I think he's a good example. Before he studied medicine, he taught high school English. If you know one subject to a pretty saturated degree and then approach another one, you learn the essential way to get at that subject. Someone who is teaching in five departments can make each one more valuable than someone who teaches a single subject all their life.

## Development: Ontogeny and Phylogeny

**Danny Roddy:** Before we wrap things up, did you want to talk about "ontogeny anticipates phylogeny," pedomorphism, and juvenilization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's that same thing—Le Chatelier and Vernadsky. The energy available to flow through the system is extremely intense in the first processes away from the ovum. The oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose are generously available. Your demand is small because you're only a few cells big, so you can suck up the environment at a terrific rate. The environment is pretty ideal until you get up to about the size of a peanut, and then the environmental limitations start being felt.

So the aromorphosis processes, where flowing energy generates complexity, are zooming through your processing system, producing a huge head and eyes. Then you start running into what your mother didn't eat and finding the need to specialize and limit your development. You start out inventing future species, trying out what the simple flow of energy does to your cells, and it expands you as a knowing being. Then, as you run into the limits, you start adapting to those limits. The worse your mother's condition is, the more you become prematurely "adultified."

**Danny Roddy:** Can this be thought of as puberty being a major landmark in aging, and the reproductive years being a slow decline to death, while pre-puberty is a time where the organism is more evolved physiologically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think at six months of gestation is when we're at our peak. The present atmosphere limits the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen you can use. So at six months of gestation, I think is where we're the most pedomorphic, and then that tapers off. It sets up a pattern predicting how much of a crocodile or primate you're going to be. If you were early deprived, you're going to be an eating machine more than an experiencing machine.

**Danny Roddy:** And women are more resistant to these negative effects because of the progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone keeps the oxygen and carbon dioxide towards an ideal for as long as you can supply all of those things together.

## Feminism and Modern Society

**Danny Roddy:** Because women naturally have more progesterone, and you talked about progesterone being responsible for temporal long-range thinking, do you see women as having a unique place in society?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1946, I read Ashley Montagu on the biological superiority of women. I've been conscious of that ever since and thought of myself as a feminist until the Gloria Steinem/CIA brand of feminism came on the scene.

**Danny Roddy:** I was shocked when I saw the video of her talking about her CIA operative days. Some people say feminism was used to destroy the basic nuclear family. Do you think that's right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, to expand the labor market to lower wages was a basic function. To as peacefully as possible dispose of the excess population that isn't needed to run the factories. With automation, the population excess is going to be a higher percentage. Fewer and fewer people will have authorization to live.

**Danny Roddy:** You think getting into feminism is reasonable, but the modern idea is misdirected towards the ruling class?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Women want to be as bad as men. We've had three terrible women Secretaries of State, like Condoleezza Rice.

**Danny Roddy:** It was ironic. People pointed out that women tend to gravitate to nurturing professions, and critics said, "No, they should want to be CEOs." But CEOs are some of the worst people. Why aspire to be like them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly.

## Conclusion: Current Work and Autism

**Danny Roddy:** What are you working on right now? You sent me your Sleep and Aging newsletter, which was fantastic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think I'll do something related to autism. That has been coming up in my thinking increasingly. Autism is something that everyone is periodically inclined to. The lack of that resonance among individuals—which is a natural property of life—as the death culture imposes itself, it shows up in more and more visible things that are diagnosed as autism. It is the deprivation of sugar, carbon dioxide, progesterone, thyroid, and the possibility of life opportunities.

**Danny Roddy:** I saw a reference to Dr. John Cannell's "Science is More" on medicine, invoking an old-school approach to act on the observation that vitamin D was deficient in autism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Many things are deficient. Breastfeeding is deficient. Prenatal happiness is deficient. Security of both father and mother before conception is deficient. Our culture is creating deficiencies of everything good. Autism is an increasingly epidemic expression of deprivation.

**Danny Roddy:** Interesting way of looking at it. Ray, thank you so much. I sincerely appreciate it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Thank you.

**Danny Roddy:** Take care, Ray. Bye.
