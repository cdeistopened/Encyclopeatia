## Introduction and Nutrition Philosophy

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, normally I would say Georgi Dinkov and Ray Peat, but we only have Ray today. Georgi, hopefully he'll come and we'll work him into what's going on, but it's just going to be a chat between Ray and I. How are you, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Danny Roddy:** Immediately before we talked about your newsletter, I wanted to get into the nutrition topic. I felt like I approached it a little bit off-center on the last episode. I thought it was good, but I thought my questions were holding you up like an authority. It wasn't conscious, but I was unimpressed with my questions. Is there anything you can think of that would broaden the scope of what we were talking about last time in terms of approaching nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, nutrition is as complex, open, and undefined as metaphysics or cosmology. It's a process of exploring, learning, and figuring things out. It's never a closed book, never a finished subject.

**Danny Roddy:** What is the problem with authoritarianism in nutrition? If somebody says, "Ray Peat says to eat 100 grams of protein and 200 grams of carbohydrate," what does that negate from the individual trying to figure things out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything is always changing, always individual, and always changed by context. What's true for one person today will necessarily be somewhat different when they're in a different place doing different things. It's always looking at your problems immediately in your context. To understand those, it helps to look at your history—how you got to where you are and what you want to do to get beyond the present. All the dimensions have to be flexible. Your digestive system reflects the things you've done in the past. Your whole being is taking form, assimilating things you've experienced and intend to experience. You have to think of yourself as an intended participant in everything, including your choices of foods.

**Danny Roddy:** Given how complex everything is and that everything is a moving target, how do you even approach the subject?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With what you've been doing and how it has worked for you. If you've been living on sweet potatoes and pork fat and you're doing okay in middle age, then you don't see much need for a change.

**Danny Roddy:** But what if somebody grew up eating cereal and fruit snacks?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They probably wouldn't have grown up very much.

**Danny Roddy:** Oh no, that's me. So would the context change if somebody writes you an email saying, "Hey Ray, I have a low pulse rate, a low temperature, high cholesterol, constipation"? Is that what makes the suggestions in context with what the person is explaining?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. All those things point to hypometabolism, low thyroid function.

**Danny Roddy:** If you're saying something like protein, carbohydrate, calcium, et cetera, you're giving those facts to that person. Then it's up to them, like we talked about last time, the creative act of conversation and that person assimilating the info and trying to extract something out of it that means something to them in their life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because their digestive system is going to have its unique oddities. It might turn out that the high protein diet that would quickly cure someone—if they already have a sensitivity to serotonin and tryptophan, for example—they might have to work into that very carefully with a diet emphasizing more gelatin than the highest quality proteins.

**Danny Roddy:** When somebody emails you and says, "I'm doing the Ray Peat diet," what do you think of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, I ask them what they're eating.

**Danny Roddy:** So you automatically assume that was... just to be completely honest here, I told you that I don't like that term, and I used to edit it out of podcasts, but it has gained a lot of traction. Do you think using that term is reducing your work into silly territory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pretty much. From what I hear people are eating on the "Ray Peat diet," at least it usually excludes eating a lot of bread, green salads, and beans. Those are a few of the things that people generally realize can be harmful.

## Thyroid and Metabolism

**Danny Roddy:** Maybe you could critique my approach. When I chat with people, there's always diet stuff, but it almost seems like if they're talking to me, it's past the point of no return with dietary intervention. Usually, they'll have labs as well, and the person will generally be at the end of the road. They'll have tried veganism, low carb, carnivore, et cetera. I'm almost inclined to suggest vitamin D, to read *Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness*, and to get into thyroid. Could you say that after age 20 or 25, it's very hard to get the metabolic rate going just with food alone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. Almost everyone benefits from adding a little bit of thyroid. The human diet historically probably always included some supplemental animal thyroid, whether it came from chicken stew, fish soup, sausages, or even blood. There was always some supplement coming from their food. Since 1940, that has been legally banned from the American food supply, and other industrialized countries imitating the US require slaughterhouses to take out the thyroid glands. People generally just don't eat the blood; it's sort of a taboo. Countries that save the blood and make tacos out of it are getting a little bit of extra hormones of various types.

**Danny Roddy:** Something I've noticed is that there's something about thyroid that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with. They'll take progesterone, DHEA, or pregnenolone, or supplements like ashwagandha or rhodiola. But thyroid is crossing the line to a lot of people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the drug companies and the doctors educated under their influence are responsible for that. The same thing caused the agriculture department to order slaughterhouses to remove it from the food supply. Broda Barnes tells some of the stories. In the 1930s, he observed that thyroid deficiency caused an extremely high rate of heart attacks, circulatory disease, infectious diseases, and cancer.

When he started popularizing that, there was a reaction. JAMA published a story about a doctor who had given a patient who had just suffered a massive heart attack a supplement of two grains of Armour thyroid, starting right off on a full standard dose rather than working into it. The patient died. That created the propaganda that natural thyroid could kill you with a heart attack. That sort of thing was amplified when Synthroid was the first synthetic thyroxine product on the market.

I was in junior high around that time. There were several fat kids, and most were seeing doctors regularly. Almost simultaneously, two or three of my fat friends said that they didn't have a hormone problem, they were just gluttons. That had been taught to the doctors, who taught it to their overweight patients. That went with doctors ordering their patients to stop taking thyroid. If an old empirical doctor had recognized that people with chronic infections or obesity were doing well taking Armour thyroid, the modern, well-trained doctors told them to stop taking it because it was dangerous.

**Danny Roddy:** In obesity, is part of the look just that accumulation of mucopolysaccharides?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, usually it is. It's a mixture of Cushing's symptoms—high stress hormones of various sorts. They can go in the direction of high estrogen, high serotonin, high histamine, high cortisol, high aldosterone, or an imbalance of the androgens. Many different hormonal directions just because your thyroid is not giving you the energy to contextualize your physiology to round everything off.

**Danny Roddy:** One of the most important things you've ever said that helped me clarify my blurry picture of physiology is: "When your thyroid is low, your pituitary doesn't have much to do and your ovaries don't have much to do either, and all the glands in your body have an easy job when your thyroid is high." I appreciated that because if you listen to other people, it's so ridiculously complicated to figure out LH, growth hormone, prolactin, and FSH. It's incomprehensible without the model of energy and stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's helpful to have a mental image of a libertarian world or an anarchist society in which everyone knows what to do and how to take care of themselves. That's when energy is abundant and your thyroid is good. When the well-distributed energy availability isn't there, then you have to look to be pushed to do what you're supposed to be doing. That's where the pituitary comes in. The pituitary is roused in proportion to how everything is failing. It pushes you this way and that way to make up for what you should be doing just on the basis of your cellular needs and cellular knowledge.

**Danny Roddy:** Little W.D. Denkla. You weren't kidding. I feel like you've integrated his work so well. All the papers were perfectly in sync with what you were saying.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's funny how he just disappeared from the world of knowledge.

## Intuition and Diet

**Danny Roddy:** Before we pass by this whole subject, I hope I'm not embarrassing you, but I think people shouldn't eat things that damage them and should eat things that taste good and provide the essential nutrients while making them feel good and function well. Is that a diet? Is there anything left to speak about in such an authoritarian nutrition world?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm okay with that as a statement that what tastes good is very important. Your impulses and needs very often are responsible for what you're eating. But if you're supplied with something not quite like what you need, then your taste might cause you to do something like overeating on sugar or salt. Your cravings are biologically logical, but if the way you are led to satisfy your cravings is abnormal, then your body might be tricked into malfunctioning even though it's following its impulses.

When your thyroid function is low, your blood sugar becomes unstable, so you tend to crave sweets and alternatively salt, which helps you to use the glucose efficiently. But if the mixed foods that would supply those needs are very distorted, then you might not correct the problem by following your instincts. So you have to use your other perceptions and thought processes to figure out just what it is your body is telling you to do.

**Danny Roddy:** What was that H.G. Wells quote? "Nature never appeals to intellect unless intuition fails"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Instincts fail.

**Danny Roddy:** Could somebody be in such a bad place that their orienting reflex and intuition is so jaded and blurry that suggesting something to them would still be a bad situation? How would you approach that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People tend to be immersed in the forces of their authoritarian surroundings. The culture they have integrated is telling them to do certain things, like go to the doctor if you feel sick. If your body doesn't play a role in those cultural instructions, then you'll go to the doctor, go to your job, maybe go to church—do whatever the culture prescribes and ignore what your body is telling you.

But anyone can start to listen to themselves. When they are mentally hearing instructions—a conscience telling them what they should be doing—if they listen carefully, they'll be able to detect the source of where that instruction is coming from. George Gurdjieff's basic principle was "Remember yourself." That really meant looking at what your body impulses are doing and putting that into conjunction with what your environment is ordering you to do. Call up an image of who is speaking the instructions to you, and then check how that image goes with your heart plexus and your solar plexus. Usually, you feel a shrinking, compressed feeling in your body when you hear those conscience voices speaking to you.

**Danny Roddy:** I feel the opposite when I eat a cherimoya. You said Gurdjieff, right? He has a quote: "Without self-knowledge, without understanding the working and functions of his machine, man cannot be free and he cannot govern himself, and he will always remain a slave."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's pretty solid.

## Ray Peat's Newsletter: Cellular Consciousness

**Danny Roddy:** I'm a little trepidatious to get into your newsletter because it's so dense. What was your motivation for writing it specifically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was sort of a shotgun approach to explaining a general approach. Like a mosaic, you put down a lot of the material that is going to make up the image, and you hope that when you get enough of the material together, you'll recognize the general meaning. It's a collection of the last 200 years of observations about how organisms work, and then looking at the very clear experiments showing definitely that they *don't* work in certain ways and *do* work in other ways that have been ignored.

For example, the purpose and intentionality of single-celled organisms all the way down to bacteria—making decisions, planning, and changing their behavior according to what they perceive the environment to require. If bacteria can do it, why can't a human brain cell do something at least partly as competent as that? I think the culture, partly to instill a helpless attitude in the public, has created this doctrine that our brain cells are among the stupidest of all parts of creation. They can only signal by on and off information, yes or no, nothing approaching the infinite judgment ability that bacteria or planaria or amoebas display.

**Danny Roddy:** The gist I get from you is that an environment that actually supports our physiology or biology hasn't even been broached yet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, someone like Kropotkin put together biology, culture, and politics into a single picture.

**Danny Roddy:** There's something you mentioned in this article about the primary cilium. That's like a little sensing organelle on the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, like our retinal cells have this little fingertip. It's like a cilium except it doesn't wiggle. It internally resonates with what's impinging upon it, and that resonance is made available to the connecting nervous system. Same with the ear, the olfactory nerves, or the touch movement detectors all through the body. Each brain cell even has its own little antenna tuning it into the environmental conditions.

*(Break: Danny calls Georgi Dinkov)*

## Consciousness and Holograms

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, Georgi, we're live. We were going through Ray's newsletter. We just talked about the cilium, the sensing organelle of the cell. Ray, what are some of the other critical things in this newsletter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The theme that comes back over and over is the conscious purpose of each of the component cells. The hologram idea is that conscious memories are not localized in any part of the tissue. Karl Pribram was the outstanding figure in that line of thinking—that the cortex, through a network of synapses, is able to make a hologram that records awareness images in a non-localized manner.

However, that is still limited by the discrete nature of synaptic individual action. Even though the pattern imposed on that network is holographic, the underlying substance of the brain function that Pribram advocated was still the old-fashioned behaviorist mechanical on/off nerve cell. It denies the complex image-like perceptions of each of the cells. I'm trying to show that everything that denies the complete participation of every cell in our conscious purposeful activity is based on an arbitrary assumption, which ultimately is a false assumption that leads to behaviorism, mechanism, and reductionism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question about holograms. Can a group of organisms, regardless of species, band together and form a super hologram that combines their consciousness into sort of like the collective consciousness that we all talk about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings. If they put their primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people having visions and contacts with people that have been dead for a long time? Basically, they're re-materializing that portion of that collective consciousness.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's important not to rule out anything, not to assume limits to awareness that aren't based on some kind of real evidence.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain-to-brain, by way of the earth's resonant chamber.

## Astrology and Resonance

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time, but in the *Cosmic Clocks* book, if he's right and the seasons are imbuing people with an essence, isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things, the absolute meaning of a certain frequency of vibratory energy—each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique identity. So the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates everything around us, including the state of the sun, the planets, the earth, and other people in that system.

**Danny Roddy:** So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means, but that's a lot.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You think that may explain part of astrology and the planets?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's what the *Cosmic Clocks*, Michel Gauquelin, discussed.

**Danny Roddy:** Where does that idea go off the rails? Is there some point at which it becomes total nonsense?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but that's just a literary genre. It can be interesting, but it's just a person creating a cultural artifact that to some extent recognizes that we are in the cosmos together.

**Danny Roddy:** If you were going to spend your life with somebody, would the month that they were born in matter to you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know. I think the clash of frequencies might make it more interesting than too much harmony of frequencies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There's an optimal antagonism, so to speak, contrarianism that a lifetime partner should provide, otherwise it becomes boring if they're too harmonized.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is sort of my impression, that you want to be able to go off independently and comeback and keep renewing others with your odd and idiosyncratic learnings.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The Chinese have a proverb that love is not so much gazing harmoniously into each other's eyes, but it's about two people looking together in a similar direction.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I thought I had said that.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Okay, then it's a resonance across time. Somebody may have plagiarized it off of your website and then presented it as a Taoist saying.

## Collective Consciousness and Metabolism

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have one more question related to collective consciousness and Rupert Sheldrake. He did a famous experiment with another person who was a contrarianist. They did experiments with chicks, training them. Each successive generation of little chicks was able to learn a new task faster and faster. Is there anything special required to tune into that collective consciousness and knowledge, like a fast metabolism? Are there things that interfere with that process, making you more isolated from the collective consciousness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think everything metabolic and neurological affects it. Do you know who Andrija Puharich was? He wrote a couple of books exploring what opens the consciousness to remote viewing. He saw it in terms of a balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic system.

He imagined that when people were asleep or extremely relaxed, their nervous system is able to extend its feelers out without regard to distance, tuning into the Earth's resonance. But during anxiety, there's a contraction and everything tends to fall towards the anxious center. If a person is in the sleep or relaxed parasympathetic state, their feelers are out. If someone related to them is in a crisis, anxiety state of adrenergic dominance, their relaxed feelers will be drawn to tune in and focus on that center of crisis. I think that might be where Michael Persinger took up his basic orientation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I thought the Pentagon was also using LSD to drug some of the remote viewers and see if that enhances the performance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mushrooms too.

**Danny Roddy:** How did you materialize from that research? How do you think it was applied?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are several videos of some of the people who were involved working for the Pentagon-related research centers, like the Stanford Research Institute. They have their personal experience statements in videos that I think are worth watching.

## Progesterone and Thyroid

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, do you have any stories about Progest-E?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, about any subject you want to apply it to. Dementia, epilepsy, sunburn, traumatic injury, chronic conditions of all sorts, arthritis, asthma, pimples, acne, all kinds of stress. Conditions on all the cellular levels, everything from personality problems all the way down to whether a cell is inflamed.

**Danny Roddy:** A quote of yours is, "Using progesterone alone is not a good approach. You have to figure out what the problem is and usually that's related to low thyroid function." So if a problem isn't miraculously solved by progesterone, thyroid was probably the next thing to investigate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you think you're dying of a migraine or a seizure, progesterone itself can very quickly bring you out of the problem, but then you have to figure out what it was that put you into that unstable condition that needed progesterone.

**Danny Roddy:** Some people say, "If your nutrition is so good, why do you need to add hormones?" Maybe a good response is that our environment is so terribly awful that maybe just even taking thyroid isn't enough defense from the onslaught of metabolic problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Even thyroid and milkshakes and quesadillas aren't always enough to make up for the horrors that are imposed on us and some of the natural defects of the environment. We probably should live more like naked mole rats sleeping in burrows in family clusters where we would be producing a proper amount of carbon dioxide, so that we would be soaked in carbon dioxide for a good part of our lives, making up for the natural imbalance created by geological changes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I read a book recently about the difference in sleep between these days and the Middle Ages. Apparently, people back then were sleeping in barnyards with animals, 15 to 20 people all huddled together. The rate of degenerative disease was much lower. They were living like naked mole rats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, having a cow and a pig in the house when you're asleep. Carbon dioxide is always a basic factor of stress relief or stress production depending on the concentration.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there anything thyroid does uniquely that progesterone either completely does not do or is much weaker at?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can uncouple the mitochondria by increasing your thyroid temporarily to shift the ratio towards carbon dioxide from lactate. Progesterone tends to stabilize the mitochondria in an efficient, well-coupled condition. To get rid of moles or skin cancers, a temporary overdose of thyroid hormone works. I've seen fairly large uterine fibroids shrink when someone was willing to stay slightly hyperthyroid, keeping a resting pulse around 110 for three months.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I thought that progesterone is thermogenic. Wouldn't that imply that it also uncouples to a degree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it achieves it by reducing loss as much as by maintaining, preventing the bypass of the mitochondria. It keeps the mitochondria going efficiently, but at the same time, it's reducing nitric oxide in the skin and preventing unwanted heat loss.

## Listener Questions: Learning and Principles

**Danny Roddy:** First question: The person quotes Heraclitus, "Polymathy does not teach intelligence of things." Their question is: "Much learning does not teach understanding. You can't really know something unless you experience it. Are Ray's thoughts analogous to this?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, you have to at least *imagine* experiencing it. The typical way of indoctrination and school learning is by way of formulas rather than at least an imagined experience. Literature and art should get your nervous system in the habit of thinking experientially rather than in terms of algorithms and rote formulas.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the sterilization of learning—turning everyone into a rigid bookworm—may account for the fragmentation of society? Everybody's learned, but nobody really knows much about the real world.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, true kind of learning always takes into account our world in common. That is always an essential aspect of any little thing that you might know. It always has to take into account the overall world that we have in common.

**Danny Roddy:** "Does Ray believe that some principles are worth dying for?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No.

**Danny Roddy:** I knew you were going to say that. Why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Who wrote the principle? Whose principle is it? You have to look at the metaphysics behind the principle. Make sure it isn't based on false assumptions and false metaphysics.

**Danny Roddy:** So dying as an alternative to getting a vaccine is not rational?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Is there a connection?

**Danny Roddy:** Say a hypothetical thing where it was like death or getting a vaccine. Despite the horrors of getting a vaccine, killing yourself would not be a reasonable option.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. It's better to be wounded and deformed by the vaccine than to be dead. So often there's an evil ulterior motive behind the principle.

**Danny Roddy:** Just to play devil's advocate, what about the phrase like, "Some things are worse than death"? Like what if life was so much suffering after getting maimed by a vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think your organism takes care of that. The stress hormones rise to the point that it simply finishes off all of the processes.

## Stress and Adaptation

**Danny Roddy:** How does the intangible of stress become a tangible phenomenon in the cell? Where does it start?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reduction of energy, I think, is the general thing. Not getting enough energy to do what it needs to adapt. It sends out signals that want more energy, and that turns on emergency organismic level processes like making more ACTH and cortisol to bring up the blood sugar and get past the temporary crisis. But the cell ultimately needs to improve its use of oxygen and glucose to properly restore the energy it needs.

**Danny Roddy:** What about the "death hormone" W.D. Denkla was searching for? Do you feel like you figured out anything that he did not?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. There's no death hormone. It's just the death struggle of the organism against these bad environmental problems. Those processes are really last-ditch survival attempts. The zooming up of your growth hormone, prolactin, and corticotropin—all of those are well-meaning survival attempts. But they just accelerate all of the poor adaptations we're making to an inadequate environment.

**Danny Roddy:** Is death like... those pituitary hormones are increasing, but maybe they cause prolonged hypoxia and that leads to death?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of our adaptations are to a defective environment to one degree or another. If you have to change your physiology to fit into the environment, the bigger those changes are, the more your pituitary hormones are involved and the more it's diverting you from what you would really like to be doing. Growth hormone has potential benefit, but when you're forced to keep secreting it along with ACTH and serotonin, the outcome wasn't intended. It means you have adapted yourself, for example, by secreting more and harder insoluble collagen, turning yourself sort of into a tanned piece of leather.

It makes you tough in a sense that can stand up to the environment a little longer, but it isn't a good adaptive course to take. If we can improve the environment—have very good nutrition, very good carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, a good amount of temperature and sunlight—then we can start mobilizing our intentional adaptive processes. In that environment, the effort to adapt will tend to dissolve the hardened collagen, remove the calcium from the soft tissues, put it back in your bones, and reconstruct a living vital organism. In a bad environment, adaptive intention leads you into degeneration. In a good environment, it leads you to restoration.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The recent study on reversing the aging of the human immune system specifically administered DHEA to block the pro-aging effects of growth hormone. It pays off that they actually were aware that growth hormone has strongly pro-aging effects.

## Research and Thinking Methods

**Danny Roddy:** How does Dr. Peat organize his reading and research? Does he have some sort of note-taking system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't. My notes over the years are the most disorganized thing you can imagine. Occasionally, they're helpful to remind me where I was, but definitely not like having a card file. I just go from one thing that interests me to another.

**Danny Roddy:** So when somebody emails you about something and you reply with eight abstracts, you're going to PubMed and finding those abstracts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, some of them I've put into my computer over the years, but usually I find things on PubMed that will answer a person's questions. Even though I consider PubMed to be largely a propaganda source, it's a leaky propaganda source.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I want to second that. Ray's method is effectively acting like a child, just following whatever interests you at the current moment. For me, synchronicity seems to play a big role. Things that I'm reading currently, somehow miraculously in a few minutes later, I find other things that pop up that are disparate but similar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep. That contributes to my basic view of how the brain and the universe work. That there's sort of a magic synchronicity, probably just because we aren't clearly aware of the mechanisms that make it happen.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you noticed that children's play is structured very similarly? They base everything quite naturally on interest.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And with kids, their choices of foods tend to work the same way. They'll eat a lot of something once and then maybe not touch it again for a month, but they're responding to something in their physiology.

**Danny Roddy:** Can Ray go over what his past week of eating has looked like?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They tend to cycle. Today, so far, I've had an omelet, milk, orange juice, and coffee, and then some leftover mushroom soup and carrot salad and orange juice and coffee for the afternoon. Yesterday, I had an appetite for a cheese taco. It just is what I feel I have an appetite for that particular day.

**Danny Roddy:** I think our last chat with you increased tortilla sales by like 1,000%.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I noticed that many years ago when I discovered that the Safeway store was selling chicken necks at something like a dollar a pound. I found two or three thyroid glands in every package. I mentioned that in my nutrition classes and never saw a package of necks again.

## Energetic State and Thoughts

**Danny Roddy:** Can you explain more about the physiological aspects of how our energetic state influences our thoughts and perception?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the high energy state is a relaxed state of readiness. The infant brain with a very high metabolic rate easily goes into complete relaxed sleep and replenishes its energy so it's ready for another episode of very intense activity. That kind of episodic energy burst tends to give you an image-oriented, chunky approach to reality and the problems you're thinking of, rather than just doggedly assembling bits and constructing a knowledge system out of learned bits. It gives you an animal quality to your episodes of learning and thinking.

**Danny Roddy:** And ruminating on the past?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes it's necessary to think about where you've been to better understand why you want to go in a certain direction. So ruminating can be constructive. My view of memory is that it's a developmental state. Even though it passes in a flash, it changes our development all through the organism. Every little memorable experience we have is changing the structure of our organism. When you're remembering, you're really being present to yourself.

## Dental Health

**Danny Roddy:** Is there a way to remineralize teeth and heal cavities?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically no. If the enamel is just slightly eroded and the protein framework is still there, yeah, it can be very nicely remineralized. But once the decay has gone through the thin layer of enamel and entered the dentine, the tooth from the inside can close off the progress. If you have a very stable hormonal vitamin D calcium balance, the tooth from the inside is constantly renewing the cytoplasm in the dentine channels and will close off, create resistance to the advancing cavity. But I've never heard of being able to fill a cavity from the inside.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen that study published in 2018? They showed that applying aspirin topically to the tooth, despite being acidic, actually led to tooth regeneration.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the acid theory of tooth decay has tremendous weakness. The idea that bacteria just make an acid... I think it's much more complicated than that, involving antibodies and subtler handling of the minerals. Thyroid is the main regulator of the health of your saliva, and the quality of your saliva really is in charge of what happens to your teeth on the outside.

## Current Events and The Great Reset

**Danny Roddy:** Is there anything new happening with the Great Reset?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The established lies are coming apart and resistance is starting to show some effects. Ron Unz has a good article showing the value of two articles, different theories on whether it was a lab accident or not, but then he gives a third interpretation: the long-established germ warfare policies of the United States. Unz goes through the facts that align so much more perfectly with this third option.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There's another article on his site which says that basically it was a failed bioweapon attack on China launched by the United States. When the Chinese didn't take the bait, the US said, "Well, we have an opportunity to use it on somebody else."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Iran really was the second target. The elite politicians in Iran had a very terrible attack right after China. I think one misapprehension of the germ warfare people was that they really seem to have believed that the ACE2 enzyme was the receptor that let the virus attack and enter cells. The fact that the Chinese have about 30% higher expression of the ACE2 enzyme led people to believe that the Chinese would suffer much more intensely. But in fact, ACE2 is what defends us against inflammatory attacks. So the populations that express the most ACE2 are the ones with the most powerful means for resisting the inflammatory consequences.

**Danny Roddy:** Isn't the idea that it's a bioweapon kind of in conflict with the idea that it's not harmful at all?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ron Unz talks about that—that it wasn't intended to kill many people, but it was a nuisance just like an effective cold virus. But the theory was that it would give Chinese 30% more colds than it would give Americans.

**Danny Roddy:** What's that word they say for making viruses? Gain of function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Luc Montagnier has clearly expressed that he understands how you create a gain of function. You find some species difference, like the human expression of the ACE2 enzyme, and adjust the virus so that it would stick more firmly to that enzyme.

The people arguing against the whole existence of viruses are in a way onto something. The mechanism by which we maintain our genetic interactions—exosomes—is the same one that viruses use. If you give a vaccine or catch a virus and get the nucleic acids into some of your cells, those cells experiencing distress will increase their production of exosomes, which pick up relevant bits of nucleic acid and proteins and package them in a little virus-like package. These exosomes travel to different parts of the body and are excreted. So we are creating things that function like viruses and look like viruses.

**Danny Roddy:** Aren't the mRNA vaccines essentially an artificial replication of that whole exosome paradigm, but in a really harmful manner?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In fact, the vaccine nucleic acid, the messenger RNA, can be packaged into exosomes and transmitted to other cells, including our germ cells, and into our sweat and transmitted to people we touch or breathe on.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A couple more things on Montagnier. He said as early as March 2020 that the virus is most certainly man-made. He also said that having a vaccination campaign during a pandemic is absolutely the dumbest thing a public health agency can do because it causes the virus to mutate to avoid the vaccine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's the sort of thing he says that they want to shut up by making him sound crazy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there's any truth to the idea that vaccinated people are now more susceptible to dying from future encounters with another virus due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several studies have shown that people who were vaccinated for influenza the following season were much more likely to catch a coronavirus. The risk of exaggerated antibody intensification of symptoms is so great that even though we don't know how often it's going to happen, it's a very crazy risk to take for the world population.

**Danny Roddy:** Why doesn't Israel give the Palestinians vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a lot of Palestinians are fearful of being experimented on by the vaccinators. If I was a Palestinian, I don't think I would take it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they kicked out representatives of the WHO because they are convinced the vaccines are intended to sterilize the population.

**Danny Roddy:** Why would Israel vaccinate its own citizens if the higher-ups understand that this vaccine is to harm people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure what they understand. The elite isn't unified. Within that power system, there are constant subdivisions of power conflicts.

## Final Thoughts

**Danny Roddy:** What do you think about the ousting of Bill Gates?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has been coming out gradually ever since Epstein killed himself, supposedly. The story was involving Bill Clinton and lots of the elite political crowd. I think the media are in turmoil. They are confused by things leaking out that shouldn't have, and I think they are in the process of reorganizing.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, I feel like the olive oil on the carrot or mushrooms is a revelation. I think it works so much better than coconut oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I noticed the same thing. There are allergenic properties in coconut that even extreme refining can miss, but olive oil in the unrefined state is a fruit oil, not a seed oil. As such, it brings with the oil a lot of anti-inflammatory, very protective intestinal redesigning and protecting drug effects.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What are your thoughts on orange peel wax? It's available as food grade material.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It sounds good. I'll find out more about it. But meanwhile, marmalade tastes very good and has those same things.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does the pulp need to be removed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pretty much the whole thing, the white stuff as well as the orange stuff, has those flavonoids.
