---## Introduction: May Wan Ho and Liquid Crystals

**Danny Roddy:** Today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, and biologist, Raymond Peat. In this hour-long episode, we'll talk about the passing of May Wan Ho, Vladimir Vernadsky, carbon dioxide, the NAD+ to NADH ratio, new and old hormones, thyroid brands, how Ray makes his coffee, and so much more.

Ray, I thought we'd start off talking about May Wan Ho. I just ran across a review of *The Rainbow and the Worm* about 15 years ago. Did you think of her as an ally in your fight against mainstream science?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. That coherence thing is where I've been going since the 60s.

**Danny Roddy:** In her photos in *The Rainbow and the Worm*, had you ever seen anything like that? I feel like talking to people about this idea of science is hard, but when you show them those photos, they almost immediately think there's more to the picture than the materialist science we've been sold.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was about 1958 or 1955 when I was in Mexico first. In the square in Pátzcuaro, people had laid out the different fish they had caught. Two different kinds of them were transparent, sort of like green jello. They called them white fish. I had some delicious fried transparent fish that were just like ordinary white fish when they were cooked—opaque, on bones, everything.

I was intrigued by how something with bones, blood, guts, heart, and all the standard organs could be perfectly transparent when it was uncooked. That made me think about the light being carried in channels to bypass the bones, effectively making bones and liver and everything disappear.

**Danny Roddy:** And that could only happen if the organism was liquid crystalline, like she talks about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, that got me interested in how water works all by itself. Around the same time, I was interested in electrical fields in organisms and water. The idea of light conductivity in special ways in cytoplasm connected to the idea that organisms are sensitive not only to electrical currents and fields, but to magnetic fields, because we have our own electrical currents inside. A moving charge is sensitive to the magnetic environment.

The first person's research that I studied in any depth was Yuri Holodov. I went to Moscow in 1968 to talk to him about his biomagnetics or magnetobiology approach. Through him, I got interested in Madeline Barnothy and her work on magnetobiology. She and her husband applied good physics to studying the dowsing phenomenon and found that organisms could detect extremely weak magnetic fields—for example, caused just by water oozing underground. Slow movement of slightly ionized water is enough for an organism like a person to detect.

I was trying to understand how that works. Then I found Solco Tromp's book, *Psychical Physics*. It was published in 1945 or so. He reviewed the old literature on liquid crystals and argued that the cytoplasm is like liquid crystals. You know how the computer monitor screen operates on the principle that a weak electrical field will reorder the liquid crystal? The biology behind that was before the industry's technology application of it, using that as the argument to explain the extreme sensitivity to electrical and magnetic fields.

## Vladimir Vernadsky and Generative Energy

**Danny Roddy:** Was that post your discovery of Vernadsky or pre?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I found Vernadsky after that.

**Danny Roddy:** Did that tie in perfectly with what you were interested in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. He just gave the bigger picture of how energy guides these intricate structures in the cells of an organism. He used Le Chatelier's principle to show that when you disturb a system, it finds a new equilibrium by adjusting whatever needs adjusting. Just by thinking in that context—that the organism is responding to the available energy with the sun or volcanic energy as the source—he reasoned with that simple physical-chemical principle that the complexity and intensity of energy flow both would tend towards a maximum. He said that big trees develop under big energy flows. Big brain mammals develop when there's an opportunity for high energy flow.

**Danny Roddy:** When you were talking about magnetism, that reminded me of when you said you thought that he called himself a "geocosmic realist"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, he had various composite names for what he was doing. Solco Tromp called himself a bio-geo-meteorologist or something like that.

**Danny Roddy:** Last time we talked, we covered a lot of ground on *Nutrition for Women* (1973–1975), which you reissued in 1993, and *Generative Energy* in 1994.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, actually I was writing on generative energy through the 80s. It accumulated. *Mind and Tissue* was the first one I wrote, actually. I gave it to a flaky publisher who lost all the references. I think the chapter on Pavlov was lost too, so I had to rewrite that, but never bothered to fix the missing references because the books were all in different libraries.

**Danny Roddy:** We discussed some of the motivation behind *Nutrition for Women*. Was *Mind and Tissue* what you were truly interested in at the time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that was my intense interest. *Nutrition for Women* was just practical things that some women friends told me would make a useful compilation.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think *Generative Energy* was a marriage of those two things?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was probably Vernadsky that was the kernel for putting those together.

## Carbon Dioxide and Respiration

**Danny Roddy:** I search your older work for carbon dioxide, and although you're constantly talking about thyroid, it seems that the emphasis on carbon dioxide might be a little less a couple of decades ago versus more now. Did things shift in the early 2000s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was sometime in the late 90s.

**Danny Roddy:** What spurred that interest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think people asking me about Buteyko. I had read some of Buteyko's articles in 1969 or so, but I didn't really think very much of it except it seemed valid. I was interested at that time in several gases—the way nitrogen fixation by chickens and mammals and people from the atmosphere was what got me interested in Buteyko. The Russians were using nitrogen in their space vehicles with oxygen, where the Americans were using helium. There were some publications arguing that you should always breathe some helium along with your oxygen because of the fact that it can be fixed. Hemoglobin is apparently a nitrogen-fixing molecule in birds and mammals as well as bacteria.

Thinking about how the gases are metabolized—for example, how does a fish keep its swim bladder inflated? The idea of pumping gases in or out. And the negative space between the lungs and the pleural membrane; there's in effect a vacuum there. The membranes are tightly in contact, but if you get a leak, your lungs collapse. If you punch a hole in the lung, the air goes out into that space and the lung shrivels up. So something is pumping absolutely all of the gas out of that space between your chest and the lungs.

Most of the air volume is nitrogen, so it's easy to see that you can subtract the oxygen from that space, but that would leave nitrogen bubbles around your lungs. So something apparently is pulling the nitrogen out of that space constantly, and none of my professors would even talk about that issue.

That left me thinking about the metabolism of all of the gases. I was worried about the turtles that have salt glands on their nose or eyes to excrete excess sodium. The membrane pump people were saying, "See, that proves that there are these marvelous little pumps that throw the ions out of the cells." On investigating that, I saw that there's carbonic anhydrase in there. Just by changing the association of carbon dioxide with water, you affect its solubility. If the acid moves out of the cell, to maintain electric neutrality, it takes a positively charged ion with it. So every time carbonic acid leaves the cell, so does some sodium. Then the carbonic anhydrase, if needed, can liberate the carbon dioxide as gas, leaving just the sodium.

**Danny Roddy:** You said that carbon dioxide is the context for all life processes. In *Mitochondria and Mortality*, you said carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increasing can cause the spontaneous creation of mitochondria. Do you find that is a pivotal thing for higher evolution?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At the time of the Carboniferous period, geologically, the carbon dioxide was 12% or something really intense in the atmosphere. That really stimulated a great abundance of life.

The way I see the ATP synthesis, I don't think it's anything fancier than the fact that if you write out the equation, you see H2O and phosphate becoming ATP. If you look at the equation and subtract water, it gives you ATP. Since carbonic anhydrase is in the mitochondrion closely associated with the formation of ATP, I think its purpose there is partly to turn the newly formed carbon dioxide into carbonic acid, which then leaves, taking away water and creating ATP by dehydrating the phosphates.

## The NAD+/NADH Ratio and Ketosis

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of carbon dioxide, a lot of people are talking about ketogenesis and ketosis diets. I think I read that carbon dioxide stimulated NADH oxidase. Would that be something, besides supporting mitochondrial respiration in general, that would support the NAD+ to NADH ratio?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's the function in Gilbert Ling's sense: an adsorbent that pulls electrons out of the system and makes a protein more actively acidic. I think it has that effect all through the cell. One of the effects of that is to let the cell release any excess water, so it has an anti-swelling effect.

The retraction of the electrons by that cardinal adsorbent action on the proteins shifts the whole electronic state of the cell, making electrons scarcer. That ends up shifting the ratio between NAD and NADH towards the oxidized NAD side.

After reading Gilbert Ling, I read Ephraim Racker and Albert Szent-Györgyi talking about electrons in cells. Szent-Györgyi's book was called *Bioelectronics*. Ephraim Racker coined the phrase "Nothing Dehydrogenases." Szent-Györgyi, working in England in the 1920s, studied related things—that there seems to be electrons or the equivalent of hydrogen from unidentified sources in living cells. Ephraim Racker removed all of the known fuel sources from cells, but his indicators of reductants kept getting reduced. He said the dehydrogenases were causing these chemicals to be reduced, but without a known source, it seemed to be an endless supply of electrons. So he called them the "nothing dehydrogenases."

Szent-Györgyi theorized that these were some of the mobile electrons in the cytoplasmic protein-lipid systems and nucleic acid systems. Some of his associates were showing semi-conductive properties for both nucleic acids and proteins based on this mobility of electrons.

**Danny Roddy:** Normally, protein, fat, and carbohydrate are the substrates for the electron flow. You're saying that because the electrons were in the cell without any substrates, that led Szent-Györgyi to think there was an electric conductivity to the cell that wasn't previously thought?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that proteins of the cell might be catching electrons from the environment. In the last 15 years, people are now talking about the trans-plasma membrane oxidases. Many people are experimenting with these indicators of dehydrogenase activity. They turn red or purple when they get reduced. Using chemicals that don't enter cells because they're strongly electrically negatively charged, they show that oxygen is removing electrons from the cell—oxidizing NADH to NAD, taking electrons out and changing color without entering the cell. So they're showing that cells don't need mitochondria for oxidative metabolism. It can happen right at the surface of the cell. Someone designed cells lacking the gene necessary to make mitochondria and still the cell respired.

**Danny Roddy:** In your *Receptors, Fields, and Therapies* 2014 newsletter, I wanted to talk about the ketone body ratio. Some people think that the NADH should be increased relative to NAD+. Is that where the confusion about the ketone body ratio is? For example, Veech says beta-hydroxybutyrate as a substrate increases NADH relative to NAD+.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's where I absolutely disagree. It involves everything—bioelectronics and electrode physiology. I think Gilbert Ling might be the only person who would agree with me on this, and Robert Becker of *The Body Electric*.

May Wan Ho in her article "Cancer as a Redox Disease" makes the common mistake of seeing cancer as not having enough electrons. I think its essential problem is it has *too many* electrons in the form of too much NADH and all of the pairs of redox—like too much lactic acid and not enough pyruvic acid. Everything that is in balance is shifted in cancer heavily towards the lactic acid side. Beta-hydroxybutyric acid is just one of those redox couples that can, if you get too much of it, shift you in the direction of cancer.

## Cancer, Injury Potential, and Cell Charge

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** May Wan Ho cited a study in which the charge on a tumor was reversed. She cited this article saying that they regressed the cancer by applying a negative field, or it was measured as having a positive charge rather than a negative charge. But Robert Becker, my own measurements, and many other people see a tumor or a cancer as an injury and inflammation. The traditional language for this kind of electric charge is called the "injury potential." If you cut your skin or any tissue is damaged, it's increasing inflammation and lactic acid, and there's a strong shift to electric negativity.

Gilbert Ling explained the so-called resting electric potential—which is highly negative in a healthy cell—as a battery effect. The way you measure it traditionally is with a concentrated solution of potassium chloride. He said that just this high concentration is enough to account for the potential. When you measure a cancer cell, you get very little charge when you poke an electrode in it. But if you measure *outside* of the cancer cell, you have this negative field. That's the injury potential.

One of my projects in graduate school was cell electrophoresis. I built my own apparatus and put cancer cells in one end of a little glass tube and applied a mild electric DC potential. With a microscope, you would look at the cancer cells as you turned on the electric field. If the cell has a high surface negative charge, it moves quickly towards the positive pole. I got very clear evidence that the cancer cells moved towards the positive pole. Other people have measured highly malignant cancer cells versus mildly malignant ones and found that the higher their surface negative charge, the more malignant the cancer is.

A healthy cell is oxidizing, subtracting electrons, creating basically a positive, slightly acidic condition. If you poke one electrode into it, you disturb that and you get a difference between the oxidizing region and the broken, not oxidizing region, which measures as a negative field.

Dan Mazia, for a long time at UC Berkeley, showed that sulfhydryl groups—which are normally oxidized to a fair degree, causing proteins to stick to each other by covalent sulfur-sulfur bonds—change during cell division. If you take away the hydrogens, they stick together. If you put the hydrogen back (reduce the proteins), they become separated and more mobile. Dan Mazia showed there is a tremendous increase in the reduced condition of sulfhydryl groups that appears at the beginning of cell division and disappears when the cell division is completed.

## Szent-Györgyi, Vitamin E, and Quinones

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Szent-Györgyi was working on muscles and nerves through the 40s and 50s. His theory of muscle contraction was that it was powered electronically by the conduction of electrons through these semiconducting proteins.

Just by accident, in connection with estrogen metabolism and quinone physiology, I was working along the estrogen side of the system in which estrogen shifts away from quinone oxidative physiology to a reductive physiology. In extracting stuff from liver, I was looking for ubiquinone-related things. I found that Vitamin E in a very pure form (with its neutral amber color) and ubiquinone (with its orange color), when I combined them, they turned instantly inky black.

When I put dots of this black combination on paper chromatography and passed a solvent up the paper, the Vitamin E and the quinone moved at different speeds and separated. It wasn't a covalent bond causing this color change. That's called a donor-acceptor bond, in which an electron momentarily leaves the Vitamin E and moves over to the quinone but then snaps back. You get an oscillation of the electron which acts like a system of double bonds within most pigment molecules.

Szent-Györgyi used a variety of these donors and acceptors. He wondered why the liver is dark purple/blackish colored. If you try to extract anything colored from the liver, you immediately get a white solid material. He was saying, "Here's the living liver in a very dark, intensely pigment-like condition. When you kill it, it's immediately colorless." He suggested it's a donor-acceptor relationship involving the electron moving along the protein.

He found that if he put a donor in a muscle preparation, nothing happened. If he put in the acceptor, nothing happened. But if he put in a donor and acceptor pair with just the right relationship to each other, the muscle contracted. That was his argument that the muscle contraction is essentially an electronic process.

**Danny Roddy:** You wrote somewhere that a group was using the estrogen myth to verify the nitric oxide myth, then to verify the serotonin myth. They were using a series of myths to substantiate their claims. That's what it sounds like with the NADH/NAD issue. The whole thing would go off the rails if you thought that the NADH should be higher than NAD+.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And it extends all the way to if the cancer cell and the nerve cell have this deficit or excess of electrons, then you're making a statement about how your electrometer is working, and even about how your redox and pH measuring meters are working. It involves a misinterpretation all along the line.

**Danny Roddy:** Why wasn't Szent-Györgyi taken seriously at the time? Was his work not conducive to making products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The commercial level of science just couldn't do anything with him. Pretty much the same with Warburg. I think Szent-Györgyi was really on the right track. Everything that he proposed practically was validated 30 or 40 years later.

## Hormones, Evolution, and Aging

**Danny Roddy:** In an old interview, you said that serotonin might be a very old hormone. Yesterday I was reading that prolactin also was thought to be a pretty old hormone. Do you think of the hormones as having a layered effect in evolution?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. And that's the problem with therapies. They forget that when they fix one layer, the organism can go wrong above and below it in many other ways. If they're thinking in terms of a molecule acting locally on the receptor, they're forgetting the whole big picture of this electric state. An excess of electrons, for example, will activate hormones at all of these levels, the oldest and the newest, in a coordinated way.

The fact that the organism is coherent in May Wan Ho's sense makes the therapy basically possibly coherent and very simple—something like changing the environment in a coherent and appropriate direction rather than trying to act on parts of the organism in a reductionist way.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you look at the growth hormones and the ones that inhibit oxidative metabolism as the oldest, and then the ones that promote differentiation and oxidative metabolism as newer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think the healthy organism in a healthy environment in the Vernadsky sense—something that's making good energy available—in that condition, you hardly need your hormones. The flow of energy is the whole thing. The movement of electrons forming water, and of oxygen and fuel forming carbon dioxide, will be having the differentiating, structuring, hormone-like action.

**Danny Roddy:** Karen asked you a while ago if there is a necessity to aging, and you replied that you hadn't seen any evidence of that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's our particular environment—more specifically, the temperature and oxygen pressure. The temperature makes many of the organisms produce unsaturated fat, but our brain development to use the energy that's available doesn't like polyunsaturated fats. They oxidize and antagonize oxygen. They're contrary to the flow of energy from sugar to carbon dioxide. So in this environment with relatively high oxygen pressure and very unstable fats, the process of living has a kind of negative hormonal influence. It's giving us signals to take emergency measures, and those emergency measures don't let us realize the proper Vernadsky organism.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think there's a time in a person's life that represents that ideal metabolic state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People have observed that newborn humans and cows—the newborn calf has an essentially saturated fat brain. People have said this is dreadful, that babies are born with an essential fatty acid deficiency in their brain. But it happens that when you increase the unsaturated fats in the pregnant animal or human, the brain is smaller and less functional at birth.

In the healthy situation where you're born with a saturated tissue, as you eat these environmental fats, they are constantly slowing your metabolism, constantly having an estrogen-like effect, tending to reduce the differentiated cell and turn everything into a fibrous lump eventually. The ideal state would be something that could be foreseen from maybe an early fetus if you could keep the environment providing energy and carbon dioxide, but with fuels that weren't contaminated with unsaturated fats and heavy metals.

## Antibiotics and Gut Health

**Danny Roddy:** I had a couple of questions about antibiotics. A lot of people are interested in your take on antibiotics like the macrolides, tetracyclines, and penicillin VK. How do you even know that you might benefit from an antibiotic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experimenting is good. I was prejudiced against medicine and so I was reluctant to ever use such things. But once I was sick and the landlady gave me something, I had this characteristic penicillin odor in my mouth and nose, and it went with a kind of euphoria. I've always noticed that just about the time I can smell penicillin on my breath, there is this euphoric sense of well-being. I think that means that before that, I was always in a slight state of stress and emergency from whatever bacteria were producing irritants and toxins.

**Danny Roddy:** You suggested two to four days of using penicillin versus a longer dose. What was the rationale behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was eating a sandwich and mangoes in Mexico. I got a very bad intestinal condition and an abscess on my jaw, and I realized there was a very quick connection between intestinal inflammation and oral health.

Later, I knew a dentist, Earl Cleary, who gave presentations on various things. He said that he had stopped his very profitable practice treating periodontal disease with surgery. He said now he just gives them a laxative and he doesn't have to do periodontal surgery. So if the bowels aren't right and something's wrong with your teeth, that could be a big indicator. For something like a massive putrid material, it can take two or three days before a moderate dose of penicillin can kill that off.

## Thyroid Brands

**Danny Roddy:** I get this question every day. Do you have any confidence in other current thyroid brands because Cynoplus and Cynomel are not being sold anymore?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For a while in Mexico when I wasn't able to get Cynoplus or Cynomel, I found other brands that were regularly sold there. One was Proloid S. Proloid used to be the concentrated thyroglobulin, the colloid material without the rest of the gland, but it was at least as good as the old Armour product. Like Armour created their Thyrolar as a synthetic equivalent, Proloid created Proloid S, and I think that's still available at least somewhere in the world. Novothyral is another of the synthetic imitations, except it has a 5-to-1 ratio of T4 to T3 instead of the more ideal 4-to-1 or 3-to-1.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you know any replacement for Cynomel? T3 Pro is mentioned frequently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the Saudi company, Profound Pharmaceutical, I think. I think that's the one I used for about a week and it did feel pretty normal to me, so I would guess that it's what they advertise it to be.

**Danny Roddy:** Synthetic versus desiccated—you would expect the desiccated, like a WP Thyroid, to work much slower than the synthetic version?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A little slower. It only takes two or three hours to digest.

## Coffee Preparation

**Danny Roddy:** Can you explain how you make your coffee? A lot of people are extremely interested.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Really, whatever is convenient. Usually filling a paper filter, sometimes a coffee sock, but currently the little paper cones. When the water is getting hot, I start and moisten the coffee without really getting it very hot. As the water gets hotter and hotter, I keep adding. So the first coffee that drips through is cool and very mild tasting, with very little caffeine in it, but it doesn't evaporate or degrade some of the delicate aldehyde-type flavor molecules. Supposedly, they're the most antioxidant part and they're destroyed if you put the boiling water directly onto the grounds.

I like to get some of the mild, low-temperature extract for flavor and then put a little of the fully boiling water at the very end to get all the caffeine.

**Danny Roddy:** So you do boil it at the end?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just the last half cup or so of water.

**Danny Roddy:** At what point is the magnesium most readily available?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it comes out all along the way. I think it's loose so you get it even if you soak it and make cold coffee.

**Danny Roddy:** That's obviously a big thing to your approach. You often say you're drinking five cups of coffee. To me, that's always demonstrated that you were very pro-food and trying to get the most out of accessible foods versus a complicated regimen of pills.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, partly it's because the industry has gone towards profit and cheapness. Vitamin E is no longer anything like it was 70 or 80 years ago. The stuff I used in the lab that reacted with the ubiquinone to produce the black color—I tried that with various more recent types of Vitamin E and it didn't work. So we know that they're taking out different fractions from the Vitamin E. I think a big part of why the old Vitamin E in the 1930s and 40s was so much more therapeutic is that the recent Vitamin E studies show it's really nothing but an antioxidant that doesn't have any of those extremely therapeutic effects that it did 60 years ago.

## Cancer Screening and Medical Harm

**Danny Roddy:** I was just going to ask you what you were working on next and if you wanted to talk about your newsletter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The next newsletter, I think I'll write about cancer and probably some of this electronic stuff. The cancer industry, I think, is starting to realize some of the problems. Last week in JAMA, there was an article questioning whether so much emphasis on breast mammograms was really productive.

The prostate doctors in the 90s—someone did a survey and asked these specialists what they would do if they had prostate cancer themselves. A majority of them said they wouldn't do anything. Before that, in the 80s, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was just being researched. At that time, the mortality was 20 per 100,000 population per year. Then they discovered the PSA, told everyone to have that measured, found lots of people with very high PSA, and told them to have biopsies. So suddenly, the diagnostic rate for prostate cancer surged hugely. But by 1992, the death rate from prostate cancer increased 50% to 30 per 100,000. So the more diagnosis and treatment in that situation really very clearly showed that the more medicine you have, the more deaths you have.

John Gofman, the radiation specialist, did nationwide statistical studies and showed that breast cancer and heart disease correspond very closely to the access to medicine.

**Danny Roddy:** Was it Harding Jones that went around the world and thought that if you just did nothing, you'd live a longer and healthier life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And currently, Gershom Zajicek is saying something very similar. He has suggested that the tumor itself might be an ad hoc organ trying to defend the body against whatever is the problem. For example, he showed studies where when a mole or a melanoma was removed, suddenly they popped up all over the body.

Knowing that sort of study, a couple of times doctors told me that I definitely had to have a biopsy of a big, ugly mole. I happened to be experimenting with DHEA at one time just after a doctor had mentioned that. Just two or three days after I had been fooling around with some DHEA, the mole swelled up like a maraschino cherry and basically ate itself up.

Every time after that when I would get a diagnosable melanoma—big, ugly, huge; one thing was as big as a jumbo olive in front of my ear—I would just put a little bit of either progesterone or DHEA and Vitamin E on the skin near it, not touching it with it. Within a few days, those things would radically change. For example, a color would change from spotty blue and white to a nice tan color, or the big black thing would start shrinking. The one like a jumbo olive took almost two weeks, but the last little bit of it was like a gray-green little dry mushroom which fell off, leaving no scar.

**Danny Roddy:** That's it for me, Ray. Thank you so much. It's a total pleasure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good. Thank you. Bye.
