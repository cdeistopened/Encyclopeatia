---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat, how are you guys? Thank you for joining us. Georgi, how are you?

**Georgi Dinkov:** I'm all right. Living a few blocks away from the White House, hoping DC will not get burned down in the next two weeks.

**Danny Roddy:** And Ray, are you living life without a mask in Oregon?

**Ray Peat:** I haven't had a mask on for weeks. I got a face shield; I thought I was going to use it to go to the bank, but the bank was no longer admitting even mask wearers, so I didn't get a chance to try out my plastic face shield.

**Danny Roddy:** Was that because of the dust, or was that a requirement for the bank?

**Ray Peat:** No, the state governor said that you could wear a face shield instead of a mask. I was just going to see if the stores or banks actually would follow her orders because the bank seemed so crazily panicked.

**Danny Roddy:** So you're opting to do that because of the negative health effects from a mask, or just not enjoying wearing one?

**Ray Peat:** Just not wanting to wear a mask. Having a piece of plastic two inches in front of your face doesn't disturb anything.

**Danny Roddy:** One of the crazy things in Mexico is that the people who seem to be the most affected are the lowest socioeconomic individuals. The people cleaning the jardin are suffering so badly wearing a mask when it's extremely hot outside. Somebody in San Francisco might not think it's a big deal to go to the shop and wear a mask, but you have to think about people that are suffering big time.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yeah.

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, Georgi, you have some questions just about life in general, and then we can move on. We were talking about respiration and the stress system in the last few live streams, but Georgi, I'll let you take the reins.

## Life in the Universe: Venus and the Moon

**Georgi Dinkov:** Ray, I'm sure you've seen the news that they found water on the moon and phosphine on Venus. There has been news over the last five or ten years that they found vitamin B3 and glycine in outer space. Especially when it comes to phosphine, the consensus says they don't know of any inorganic process capable of creating phosphine; all processes on Earth seem to involve life. Do you think that suggests life forms on Venus and other planets?

**Ray Peat:** Very possible, but I don't think they have a broad enough conception of what life is. I think there are probably life equivalents that have gone down very different routes for making organisms. I think of it as a basic reflex of being, of matter itself, that is a starting point of life. You can go off in an infinite number of directions, except as limited by those innate impulses intrinsic to matter. So, I would not limit my possibilities to thinking that organisms had to have been the source.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would be a good test for life, considering that scientific ideas about life are so limited?

**Ray Peat:** I think it has to be an inductive kind of perceptual reason. Watch something and see what happens.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So, if it displays pattern recognition qualities that would classify as consciousness, basically?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, self-organizing and generating order out of disorder.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Right, but it's not at all limited to the physical manifestations that we're familiar with here on Earth.

**Ray Peat:** Right. I think you could imagine processes that are more like a layer of matter that keeps reorganizing itself in all directions, but without separating off into individual organisms. My picture of a solid substance is very similar to everything we think of as life. In a metal, you have magnetic domains and crystal-forming domains. With the passage of time and energy through the metal—like if the metal bends back and forth—these domains will interact, build up, and form crack possibilities.

Similar to magnetic domains, if you hammer a magnet, it gradually loses magnetism unless it's in a magnetic field. But if you hammer a piece of iron in the Earth's magnetic field, the iron will rearrange itself and form a big magnet because those little domains are constantly ready to respond to their environment. Even though the metal seems to be conducting as a whole unit, I think there are electronic domains on a small scale that define properties such as photoelectric properties. All of these intrinsically organizing subunits of something that seems to be a mere mass of an element have lifelike properties. I would see granite, for example, as intending to become more alive.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, if we can talk of any generic requirements for life, it would be some form of a self-directed, self-controlled, autonomous electron flow?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, exactly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But the shape of that life form would be context-specific. Saturn would have a different life form than Venus.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, because nature is developing in relation to its environment. I think that's always happening. Everything on some level knows where it is in the world—not only where, but when. Everything is needing to be defined in terms of its momentary environment and the tendency of the environment to be changing in a certain direction.

**Georgi Dinkov:** According to this discussion, all of these approaches that NASA has to finding life seem hopelessly obsolete. They're just looking for something that looks like bacteria no matter where they send their probes.

**Ray Peat:** Exactly. They're ideologues as to what life is. If you look at what they dogmatically believe a cell is, you have to say that the whole enterprise is stupid. Even as they try to understand bacteria on Earth, they're committed to impossible doctrines. So naturally, if they look for something that doesn't quite exist on Earth, they're likely to be missing everything interesting.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you make of the reports that the original Voyager probes that went to Mars in the 1970s apparently initially reported finding organic life forms, but the powers that be quickly decided it was a mistake and the sensors weren't properly calibrated?

**Ray Peat:** I think that happens all the time. The raw data everywhere is morphed into the official conclusion. Like the Michelson-Morley experiment: the textbooks insist that they didn't find an ether drift, but it's very clear in their data. In follow-up studies over the next 20 or 30 years, it kept being confirmed. The establishment periodically subsidizes someone to shoot down the alternative interpretations just because they violate the paradigm.

## Creation of Matter and Time

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the discovery of life outside of Earth may have a politically destabilizing effect that may trigger a collapse of the current fake ideas?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's exactly the same sort of thing that led to Gilbert Ling being isolated and walled off from the scientific world.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You mentioned Halton Arp a bunch of times. If what he found was taken seriously, that would lead to a reimagining of everything, right?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Fred Soddy, the isotope guy, was a very interesting person who believed in continuing creation in empty space, exactly harmonizing with Halton Arp.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the continuous creation would be, in the Electric Universe theory lingo, the creation of charged particles out of neutrinos under the effects of the electrical force?

**Ray Peat:** That's their idea, but Halton Arp or Fred Soddy believed that cosmic rays represented newly created atoms. Halton Arp was seeing these redshifted clouds attached to an old-looking galaxy. I think he was seeing concentrated, newly formed matter. Arp was suggesting that the stray bits of it that didn't condense in a new redshifted galaxy are what we see as newly created matter constantly streaming through the world.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would be the process that creates that new matter? Is that like the energetic intensity of a star?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, and they argued that it was the passage of time itself—the asymmetry of being. Time is a property of matter getting richer in quantity, improving its complexity and mass. No one ever really attempted to argue against his reasoning. There was simply the assumption of 160 years ago that time must be symmetrical, but it just doesn't make sense.

There was a mathematical physics professor at the University of Oregon who believed he could explain nuclear fission and particles coming from the future, but no one has rationally tried to deconstruct Kozyrev's view that matter is asymmetrical in the sense of always getting later, and that passage of time is adding information and energy to the universe constantly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In those original Dudley papers about the neutrino sea, I think I remember him saying that he thought the neutrinos were created inside stars.

**Ray Peat:** That would overlap nicely with Kozyrev's time. Kozyrev said energy is being created in relation to the mass. His predictions of planetary internal energy have been confirmed fairly recently, even in terms of the big gaseous planets. Everything is fitting his scheme of heat production internally in proportion to their mass. He worked it out for stellar energy, but then applied it to the Earth's internal heat and was looking to test it in the dark of the moon when he saw red eruptions on the moon. That has been confirmed repeatedly, but it was denied just because it violated the conservation of matter and energy at such a radical level.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If matter is created constantly and energy increases proportionally, wouldn't that immediately violate the conservation of matter and the second law of thermodynamics?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, but he pointed out that that was all deduced from Christian beliefs about the creation of the universe.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of your interviews with Danny, you talked about Lenin and the idea of memory versus matter. You said Lenin stated that matter is nothing except what we can know and become, but we don't know where matter is coming from. Is that the ultimate unanswerable question?

**Ray Peat:** I think all of these people have given a rational side of the answer: neutrinos appearing according to the mass of the matter, Kozyrev's projection of stellar energy in terms of mass, or cosmic rays being the earliest form of matter coming into existence. I think the process of knowing where matter comes from will involve getting a grasp on what the nature of a neutrino is, and what electrons, protons, and neutrons are. A picture will emerge that has a more satisfying answer to why matter is emitting energy and becoming greater in complexity and mass.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The physicist David Bohm thought that there's a creative principle in the universe. Do you think that creative principle may be what's responsible for this constant stream of matter into existence?

**Ray Peat:** Yep. That's just another way of talking about the same thing. Lancelot Law Whyte was looking for that same principle that Bohm called the creative principle, or that Kozyrev called time. I think they're all talking about exactly the same thing.

## Consciousness, Dreaming, and Visualization

**Georgi Dinkov:** When humans exercise their creative principles, such as painting or creating music, do you think we're doing something akin to creating energy or matter?

**Ray Peat:** I think of consciousness as a sort of electronic gel inside the brain. It has different properties according to the chemical and biological energy of the cells, but consciousness is electronic in nature, like an excited cloud that is simply resting on the living substance and functioning to integrate it.

When it's operating at a low energy, some people will never dream in anything but words or symbols. Others will only dream in monochromatic images. People who have had a very happy life, not too much stress, will have more satisfying, full-sensory polychromatic dreams. Their thought processes will be able to be relatively free-floating, allowing them to imagine things kinesthetically. We're helping the universe to generate the possibilities for the next step of substantial change.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the sensory deprivation experiments where they put people into soundproof, lightproof rooms, and within a few minutes people start to dream while awake?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Anyone can do it if they just pay attention. Many times I've asked people what they see when they close their eyes, and they usually say, "You don't see anything." But if you ask, "Don't you see black or red?" lots of people will deny that they see blackness.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Would you say that this is an indication of the brain's constant need to create through dreams?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Once you start doing it, you see that there's stuff going on. It isn't just the color of your eyelids. You're looking into your brain, and the brain is constantly playing around producing all sorts of things. It's like tuning in on a very rich TV.

**Danny Roddy:** I'll put myself out there, but I'll see fractal patterns and big circular objects that seem electric passing by. I've noticed taking things like progesterone and thyroid seem to calm down the fractal patterns.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, you can get perfect blackness if you are very calm and in the dream-ready state. It's a very impressive darkness that you don't necessarily notice at night or in a cave. It's the internal quietness of your retina and brain. As soon as you are active in any sense, then you start seeing thoughts and dreams.

**Danny Roddy:** One other thing for me: since I was a little kid, if I lay down and press on my eyes, it almost seems like a psychedelic show.

**Ray Peat:** Sure. It's creating stimulus inflow on your retina and that activates your visual center. Did I ever tell you the experiment they did with chickens? They put electrodes at the back of their eyeballs. When they showed them a checkerboard pattern, they would get a checkerboard pattern in the pickups. When they took the eyeball out and measured the optic nerve, it became totally quiet. But when they gave them LSD, they started getting all kinds of complicated imagery at the outer end of the optic nerve. That shows that chickens at rest aren't projecting thoughts out into the world.

But when you test a similar thing by putting an image onto a floating contact lens projector so that the image becomes fixed on the retina, in just two or three seconds of complete fixation, the image blanks out. If it's a random image, like a squiggly line, it quickly disappears. But if superimposed on that squiggly line there is a familiar shape like a letter or number, all of the squiggly lines disappear, but the retina stays sensitized and continues to see the images that are meaningful to the brain. This indicates the brain is meaningfully re-energizing and sensitizing the retina.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, dreaming is during the day external impulses imprinting patterns on our retina, and at night when the stimulus is no longer there, the brain goes into free creative mode juxtaposing all of these images?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, not necessarily. The LSD type dream tends to be like perceiving luminosity in space, but it can concentrate on the retina. Salvador Dali was very good at that kind of introspection. He called the brain-dependent, eye-independent imagery "Camembert" for its continuity and lack of granularity. He called the seeing that involves the retina "caviar" because it's broken up into nervous units.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think serotonin and melatonin are necessary for dreaming?

**Ray Peat:** I don't know.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Some of the dreaming effects of LSD are claimed to be due to serotonin receptor stimulation, but cyproheptadine is used to calm down nightmares in PTSD, yet it doesn't eliminate dreams.

**Ray Peat:** My first experiences with cyproheptadine were to improve my breathing at night. For the first few nights, I got good sleep, but after about five nights I started having weirdly intense dreams. I think it was the changing balance of serotonin and histamine. I stopped taking it, and when I returned to it, I found I had become about ten times more sensitive to it. It let loose something in the dream apparatus that made them disturbingly random and intense.

## Planetary History and Evolution

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to ask Ray about the "Symbols of an Alien Sky." David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill originated this idea. In a Vernadskyian sense, if what they're talking about regarding Saturn, Venus, and Mars created some amazing electrical confirmation thousands of years ago and blocked out our sun, how would that have changed evolution in us?

**Ray Peat:** The changing magnetic fields—I think our brain development is very susceptible to the weak magnetic fields of the Earth, and those are changed by events on the sun. Velikovsky and others theorized that it was these solar system events that created the great religious myths, stories of the flood being actual historical memory of interactions, like a spark passing between Venus and Earth.

**Danny Roddy:** Would Saturn or Venus have taken the role of our sun? Besides the magnetic fields, the heat being thrown at the Earth could have led to some superior evolution of humans?

**Ray Peat:** Have you ever read the guy that intended to debunk astrology and ended up confirming that he could see effects of the five nearby planets on personalities? Michel Gauquelin.

**Danny Roddy:** Cosmic clocks.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah.

**Danny Roddy:** So those planets being in very close proximity would have changed everything?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, our time, the actual passage of time and intensity of chemical reactions, everything influenced by gravitational fields and the concentration of neutrinos. That was Horace Dudley's idea that could explain the Michelson-Morley Ether drag: that if neutrinos have a taste for associating with mass, then they tend to form a gradient, getting more concentrated towards the center of the Earth. When Miller took his apparatus to high altitudes, he found less drag, and more drag in deep basements, consistent with Dudley's idea that the neutrino sea constitutes the luminiferous ether.

## Nuclear Decay and Ancient Technology

**Danny Roddy:** If their hypothesis is right, this seems like the most important thing imaginable. It explains so much about human history.

**Ray Peat:** I exchanged letters with Horace Dudley and asked his opinion on crystal domains being resonance factors for neutrinos, and that the crystalline nature of the Earth would be what they were attracted to. He agreed that seemed reasonable.

I ran across a clipping by a physicist named Anderson who put radioactive carbon isotopes in fatty acid. In the test tube, they produced perfect normal random nuclear decay. But when he let a drop of this form a monolayer on aluminum foil, he recorded non-random decay. This showed that a force as weak as the crystalline-like surface of a metal would allow energy to store up and hit the atoms in a non-random intermittent fashion.

Dudley warned that we don't know enough about the factors that cause nuclear decay. He warned that nuclear bombs and reactors might not obey the assumption of random nuclear disintegration. Anderson published his article the very same week Dudley was warning against the dangers of non-random fission, and neither was aware of the other.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the news that the intensity of the sun's magnetic field influences the apparent randomness of radioactive decay?

**Ray Peat:** I haven't heard that, but that's the same idea. Weak forces in the environment are not irrelevant to nuclear decay.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the natural nuclear reactor that exists in Gabon, Africa?

**Ray Peat:** No.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Archaeologists found a nuclear reactor that has been creating mini nuclear explosions every couple of hundred years for at least 100,000 years. They were worried: if this reactor is capable of spontaneously going off, what does that mean for our man-made reactors?

**Ray Peat:** That sort of thing must be suppressed. It will destroy all of the existing assumptions of physics.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that's one of the major reasons not to pursue nuclear power? The evidence shows these things tend to end badly.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. If you're familiar with physics professors, you know how rigidly dogmatic they are. When there was evidence of cold fusion, they practically foamed at the mouth. Dudley warned me not to talk about any of these things if I was not financially independent.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there have been civilizations on Earth that have been more knowledge-advanced, capable of feats such as building the pyramids or the structures in Mexico?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Intelligence is popping up everywhere. My favorite old civilization was the one that made those giant round heads in Mexico, the Olmecs. They were so intelligently designed and sculpted.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There's a guy in Florida, an immigrant from Latvia, who single-handedly built a castle using limestone blocks (Coral Castle). He claimed he discovered a nature of magnetism unlike anything official science says. Do you think there's truth to that?

**Ray Peat:** No, but I'm open to all kinds of alternative interpretations.

## Authoritarianism and Power

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think if humanity is allowed to develop spontaneously without authoritarian influence, we will be able to resolve most of our pressing problems?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. As soon as an interesting idea pops up in a university or corporation, it's likely to be destroyed. If you stop shooting down all of the interesting alternative ideas, things would multiply realistic possibilities exponentially.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You were born in the 30s. Do you remember a freer time?

**Ray Peat:** Oh yeah. From the late 30s to the late 40s, I saw a horrible increase in authoritarianism. 1950 was when it really took off with full government support to cleanse the high schools and universities of dissenting thinking.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there may be a natural factor that contributed to that?

**Ray Peat:** No, I think it's the accumulation of power in the ruling class. Hitler accumulated power from American, British, and French banking institutions. The defeat of Germany was really the universalization of the structure of evil he had constructed. His intelligence apparatus was taken over by the CIA. The same bankers that created Hitler collaborated with the CIA to continue the project. That's why there was such a burst of evil the year the CIA was born.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you see power as a concept akin to glycolysis and intelligence as akin to oxidative phosphorylation?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, energetically it's like cancer. It runs very fast, but very stupidly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the article about Klaus Schwab? Born in 1938 in Germany, having assimilated the ethos of Nazism. All of his talking points are a continuation of Hitlerism.

**Ray Peat:** Same way that Konrad Lorenz with his genetic determinism was amplified with the defeat of Germany rather than suppressed.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was watching a video suggesting the World Economic Forum was making a power move among the elite. Do you think there's truth to that?

**Ray Peat:** I think the World Economic Forum has taken over right along with the CIA and the top biggest banks. The Gates Foundation is one of their tools, but I think the brain of the system is between the World Economic Forum and the CIA.

## Vaccines and Biological Warfare

**Georgi Dinkov:** I wanted to raise a point about vaccines and the military being involved. There's a federal law which mandates that the National Health Service, which is technically part of the military, is always involved in any vaccine trial.

**Ray Peat:** That's true that they are a branch of the military establishment.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There have been declassified documents suggesting the military is actively looking at every vaccine trial to see if it could become another bioweapon.

**Ray Peat:** Throughout the history of the 20th century, they've been operating a biological weapons establishment. Around 2015, news started coming out about how sloppy they were—thousands of potentially dangerous leaks of engineered viruses. This led to the moratorium which led to Fauci taking some of the programs outside the country, to China for example.

I think the fact that we got so many leaks appearing suddenly was specifically part of the program. The Rockefeller Foundation, Gates Foundation, and World Economic Forum were working on this planned creation of a panic. It's very effective to let information leak out that these super dangerous engineered viruses might have been leaking all along.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why would China allow a US-led laboratory on their territory?

**Ray Peat:** I think they were hoping they would have more knowledge of what the threat was if they were participating in it. But I doubt they realized that these plans had been going on for years to declare the pandemic. They took all necessary precautions, but within two or three months they were celebrating holidays in gigantic public assemblies in Wuhan.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So you think China realized it's a false flag and that's why they reopened?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, I think they realized the threat was gone about May and they reopened everything.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Speaking of the vaccine, did you see the news that three out of four phase three trial vaccines had serious adverse events? One was transverse myelitis, which is the media's euphemism for polio.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, and have you seen the figures showing that the very year the polio vaccine came out and polio cases dropped, other things such as myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome skyrocketed back up to the level seen in polio epidemics? One thing disappears when they rename it something else.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is causing the polio? Is it a viral disease or toxicity?

**Ray Peat:** Starting early in the 20th century, people noticed that polio epidemics appeared first in countries where the medical profession started injecting drugs. The hypodermic needle had been invented just 10 or 20 years before the first polio epidemic. People noticed that the paralytic polio cases practically all had been previously injected with something. By 1950, that was being seriously investigated. Animal experiments showed that injecting an irritant into the muscle sends signals to the brain indicating inflammation and damage, creating a paralytic localization.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the aluminum that has replaced lipopolysaccharide as an adjuvant can trigger the same symptoms?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's very powerful. Some of the aluminum shows up in the brain.

## Physiology of Offense and Violence

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you referenced the Paul Andrews paper, "Is serotonin an upper or downer?" He argues that the melancholic brain is reconfiguring to learn solutions to complex problems, a process coordinated by serotonin. Is there a certain physiology with the intense anger people feel when reacting to an idea they don't like?

**Ray Peat:** It does activate serotonin, and probably histamine too. That undoubtedly increases their intestinal and vascular permeability. It's like slandering their mother—blind fury.

**Danny Roddy:** You said on an older podcast that if you don't feel good, you're aging or degenerating. If you're not in the euphoric state, there's something wrong.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen studies showing that mitochondrial dysfunction ensures an animal will assume a subordinate status while becoming extremely aggressive?

**Ray Peat:** The typical authoritarian personality: subservient to power but vicious towards underlings.

**Danny Roddy:** Had we talked about James Prescott's old article on pleasure and the origins of violence?

**Ray Peat:** He looked at 80-some anthropological studies and saw an invariable pattern: an authoritarian culture where males were high in the hierarchy and women/children were mistreated always had some kind of bodily mutilation (scarring, circumcision). These features—hierarchy, cruelty, and mutilation—went with a warlike policy.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think the opposite could also be used to militarize the culture? The encouragement of extreme sexual promiscuity?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Wilhelm Reich made that argument that denaturing sex was behind the commercialization of sex. Taking the love out of it made it mechanical and biologically unsatisfying. The FDA burned all of Reich's books, including *The Mass Psychology of Fascism*, which he said was based on sexual control.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you said the use of non-communicative jargon can be an indication of a personality disorder.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, they would be embarrassed to admit their total ignorance, so they babble out words that are idiotic but assume no one will understand because it was based on Latin words. Authoritarianism is why doctors don't have to think about what they're doing.

## Hospital Environment: Light and Plastic

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you know when the replacement of incandescent light bulbs in hospitals happened? Do you think that coincided with the increase of authoritarianism in the medical profession?

**Ray Peat:** People started talking about it in the 50s. John Ott emphasized that full-spectrum light can restore lots of degenerative problems. Some of Ott's experiments showed that weak X-rays were being produced at the ends of fluorescent tubes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think also the plastic, which has become pervasive in hospitals. There was a study showing that simply peeling off Scotch tape produced full-blown X-rays.

**Ray Peat:** Plastics are everywhere and static electricity gets discharged all the time. A lot of the plastics are still emitting toxic chemicals too.

## Nutrition: Mexican Coke and Thyroid

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, since living here, I've noticed people drinking Mexican Coke. Years ago, you mentioned having a Coke with your steak, which exploded my brain. Do you feel like defending Mexican Coke?

**Ray Peat:** I think sucrose has great virtues therapeutically. In the case of an animal in shock, they would pour a mouthful of honey in its mouth, and in a few minutes, the animal would be up. But if you compare just coffee with added sucrose, I don't think you get quite the effects you do with Mexican Coke. I think the coca leaf extractives are really biologically active.

**Danny Roddy:** So the coca leaf extract has medicinal anti-inflammatory properties?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. When they compared Pepsi to Coke, Pepsi was high in sodium, but Coke was very high in potassium, and the plant extractives are the only logical source for potassium.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you said in 2011: "When people supplement thyroid and eat liver once or twice a week, their acne and dandruff and many other problems usually clear up very quickly."

**Ray Peat:** You can make up for the absence of liver, but it takes a lot of attention. Vitamin A is hard to get enough of in the active animal source of retinol. They're pushing carotene, which is a powerfully anti-thyroid, anti-progesterone agent.

**Danny Roddy:** A few times you said that the Cynoplus tablet is two and a half grains, but I thought it was three grains.

**Ray Peat:** It depends on your definition of a grain. The FDA decreed that 100 micrograms of T4 is equivalent to 25 micrograms of T3, but that ratio is imaginary. In the average 35-year-old female, 100 micrograms of T4 very often has anti-thyroid effects.

At the beginning of the 20th century, they used wet thyroid tissue. When companies began dehydrating the product, taking out the water meant the defatted plant was three or four times as effective. They added lactose to make up the weight so doctors could use the same "grain" measurement. But the FDA took over and proclaimed the content. It's misleading to describe the hormonal content of an untested glandular preparation. Just talking about T3 and T4 in micrograms is a lot simpler than the erroneous measurement of grains.

## Listener Questions

**Georgi Dinkov:** I keep getting emails from people unhappy about our stance on vaccines. They ask, "What about really deadly viruses like rabies that are guaranteed to kill people unless they get vaccinated?"

**Ray Peat:** How do they know that? Lots of people have been bitten by a rabid dog and weren't where they could get treatment, or maybe took an herb and were fine. I think it was just their natural tendency not to contract rabies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** My second question is related to pregnenolone. Some people report bad side effects even with 99.9% pure pregnenolone. Do you have any specific contaminants in mind?

**Ray Peat:** Even one part per thousand, if it's something very active like an estrogenic fragment of a steroid, can cause symptoms. I started having bad reactions to everything except the old Syntex product.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think it's possible that even pure pregnenolone, by sitting in a bag, may disintegrate into estrogenic substances?

**Ray Peat:** Very possible.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So a good storage method is to put it in the freezer?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. If you can take a teaspoonful of it with no adverse effects for two or three days, then you're pretty sure it's the real stuff.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, Georgi, thank you guys so much. Sincerely appreciate it.

**Ray Peat:** Nope.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Just stay safe.

**Danny Roddy:** We'll catch up next month. Thank you, everyone. Bye.
