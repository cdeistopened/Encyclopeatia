## Geopolitics, Ukraine, and the CDC

**Danny Roddy:** We're live with Georgi Dinkov and Raymond Peat. We're just catching up with Ray about Mexico. Last time we talked, Ray, I don't think the CDC had come out and said that masks were basically useless. I don't think they had admitted the PCR test was useless. Now with this whole Russia-Ukraine situation, is there any way to synthesize this into something that makes sense from your point of view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are so many undeniable things now that the CDC just has to recognize some of them to not seem totally crazy and crooked—but they are basically crazy and crooked. The government policy on Ukraine is some weird combination of very crazy and very stupid. They're alienating so much of the world which can perceive what is going on, with Russia being the peacemaker and the US being aggressive to an insane degree.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that just a complete diversion? It can't be a coincidence that they ended the COVID narrative and then this started up immediately.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's connected.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there a purpose to it, or is it a complete phony story? I've been reading that people in Russia or Ukraine were completely unworried by the whole situation; it was just people in America getting riled up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the president of Ukraine, in a phone conversation with Biden, told him to calm down. You can't tell a person with dementia to calm down; they're agitated all the time.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding the ending of the masks and the gaslighting of people who have been saying this for two years—do you think they're ending this stuff because something worse is coming? Like Marburg, which we discussed last time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they're hoping to create enough fear and excitement around Ukraine, provoking Russia into occupying the eastern part of the country, so they have something more permanent to focus on. The president of Croatia and the governments of Germany and France are questioning the rightness of NATO policies. Croatia says they won't join in if the US goes to war.

**Danny Roddy:** Does this fit in with the Great Reset, or is this just an anomaly? I don't understand how this fits into a greater picture other than being a diversion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's just crazed people stirring up excitement, recognizing that war presidents are always powerful. People get in line behind a war president.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think he'll be re-elected because of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would suppose that's what he has in mind.

**Danny Roddy:** What do you make of Putin being a part of the World Economic Forum program for students that Klaus Schwab had? Does that worry you about Putin's ability to be a good leader?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I don't know about that program.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you seen the Western media making a big deal out of Russia making the vaccine mandatory? Do you think there is any truth to that, or are they trying to present Putin as "part of the team"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I hadn't heard anything about it being mandatory. I heard only 30% or so were vaccinated there and that there wasn't a big push to go further.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yeah, I don't think there's a big push. It's just the way Eastern Europe operates. Basically, nobody trusts the government. Me being originally from Bulgaria, the vaccination rate there is even lower than 30%. Several governors of the republics that make up the Russian Federation have made the vaccine certificate mandatory for "participating in public life." Unfortunately, the only thing we know is through Western media. I've heard people I know in Russia say, "Yeah, there may exist something on the books, but nobody's really enforcing it."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That would be my suspicion. Everything I've read or heard Putin say seems like he's a perfectly conscious person.

## Mass Formation Psychosis and Social Control

**Danny Roddy:** Just to finish that thought, it was the hidden alliance of former WEF Young Global Leaders working in lockstep to enforce the Great Reset—Macron, Trudeau, Ardern, Boris Johnson. Moving on, do you think the situation in Canada with the 50,000 trucks going to Ottawa has a chance of toppling the government?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw Trudeau's nasty little video bit on people with "impermissible beliefs" and how something has to be done about it.

**Danny Roddy:** Right, and he's self-quarantining despite being fully vaccinated because he doesn't want to meet the truckers. Regarding the term "mass formation psychosis," do you have any thoughts on it since it penetrated the internet consciousness recently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's mostly just a phrase that catches attention. The culture *is* a mass psychosis. Nothing dramatic has changed; it's a chronic manipulation of the mass psychosis.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I feel like that term doesn't include the traumatic part. You only get to that point after being traumatized so many times.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but our society specializes in trauma and threat.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If this continues for much longer, I would say a majority of the population will get to a point where they're basically certifiable. Even if the Great Reset comes to fruition, it will become hard to sell to those people because they will lose their grip on reality.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a matter of degree. I've considered the public to be a very high percentage of complete insanity now for 60, 70, or 80 years.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there's a critical percentage of the public that has to retain some sanity for social organization to exist? Or is the elite fine with 99.9% complete lunatics, even if that means they have to roll out the big guns?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They've got people like Noam Chomsky saying the unvaccinated have to separate themselves and getting food is going to be their problem.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I'm not worried about the unvaccinated; they will be able to get food. What about the people living in the big cities? They depend entirely on supplies from the countryside.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It would be advantageous if a higher percentage of people thought like individual intelligent animals. There's a sort of lemming consciousness that was developed powerfully after the First World War. It started with the government propaganda ministry, faded out for a while, but was restored after the Second World War and became a powerful shaper of society.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the supply chain shortages were unforeseen by the elite? If the city population starts to starve, then all bets are off, including for the elite.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eric Schmidt's speeches and committee work for the Pentagon indicated as early as 2019 that their primary intention was to wreck the economy. You can't make a new digital alternative reality until you've created desperation and wrecked the old economy thoroughly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Right, but as long as humans are organic, they depend on food. If they wreck the food supply to the big cities, why would people go for any reset if they have nothing to eat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's to be graded carefully enough that they get weaker and sicker without outright starvation of masses. Like the evidence coming out that 5% of the vaccines, according to their lot number, were coded to be either lethal or non-lethal. You can see a very concentrated mortality from those 5% early in each lot sequence. They weren't intending to cause massive die-off immediately, but only 5% per period of time.

**Danny Roddy:** I think Michael Yeadon said those were concentrated towards red states. Is that true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That would probably be the preference of the people controlling distribution, but I think they have to make it look even-handed to some extent.

## Vaccine Pathology and Hospital Protocols

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think the spike protein would eventually accelerate disease? Did they know the adjuvant was so harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was probably a consideration, but I think some people are in a bigger hurry than others. Have you read about Dr. Bhakdi's pathology studies in which 93% of the deaths autopsied following the vaccine were caused by the vaccine—typical clotting and inflammatory evidence?

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think in some countries they actually ban doing autopsies specifically on the vaccinated to prevent these discoveries. They just sign a death certificate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The policy is: don't treat the sickness other than by vaccines or oxygen, don't do autopsies, and don't publicize the actual cause.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you know how prevalent Carbogen is in hospitals? Is it fairly exotic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is still very rare. I've had people check; I think only two or three hospitals had it on hand out of thousands.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you aware of anything in the medical curriculum that discusses mixing carbon dioxide with oxygen to improve uptake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think it's all the phony way of calculating pH and bicarbonate base excess rather than focusing on carbon dioxide and the availability of oxygen.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I asked friends who are doctors, and they gave me a blank stare. They said, "There is no foreseeable medical condition under which we would administer carbon dioxide. We will do everything possible to decrease it."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's following the UK committee from 1955 that declared it irrational to be concerned with keeping CO2 in the blood. Absolutely no evidence in their support, but it sounded right to them.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So things like the Bohr effect are just mentioned as an exotic idiosyncrasy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way they teach acid-base regulation makes it so hard to conceive and calculate that doctors seem boggled by the effort, so they get things exactly backwards.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I looked at studies on people hospitalized with COVID-19, vaccinated or not, and every single one had a high anion gap—basically various stages of lactic acidosis. Isn't that basic? Most of these people are dying from metabolic acidosis, namely low carbon dioxide and high lactic acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there are studies showing you can turn off lactic acidosis just by giving some carbon dioxide. It goes right to the source and turns off lactate production.

## Starvation, Digital Currency, and The Green Revolution

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, can you comment more on the starvation and third-world country situation? People are incredulous that it's a possibility.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Indian experiment in digital currency starved basically everyone that didn't have a bank account when they outlawed currency. That was a trial of how to do it under more control. Gradually, they'll tighten the availability of real currency, get people dependent on banks, and then squeeze the money supply so the poorest people die at the highest rate.

**Danny Roddy:** So this leads to digital identification and central bank digital currencies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has been created deliberately going back to the Green Revolution. That whole thing was a fraud intended to centralize the control of food, giving Monsanto and the fertilizer companies absolute control over food production. Not to increase the food supply for the world, but to make it cheaper for industrialized countries and out of reach of the farmers producing it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I find it quite ironic that Monsanto, Bayer, and other large chemical companies—whom the green movement used to protest and even bomb in the 70s—are now on the same team. They are part of the agenda of sustainable development. The irony is lost on the protesters.

**Danny Roddy:** Were you able to identify when the CIA started using progressive liberal stuff to their advantage? Gloria Steinem said she met with the CIA and was shocked they were liberal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. The Congress for Cultural Freedom supported right-wing socialists throughout European cultures, and the Students for a Democratic Society and the "New Left" were all CIA progressive movements.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think in the future we'll find out about "MK-Woke"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there needs to be a coordinated effort. All they have to do is pump them full of SSRIs and unleash them on society.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There's a novelist named Cummings who wrote about the progressive politics of the CIA. He suggested they were responsible for keeping Mandela from being shot early on because that would have forced progressives to come out against apartheid too soon. Mandela gave an interview in the early 2000s where he said, "In order to survive in the apartheid prisons in the 1950s, you had to be CIA or play both teams."

## Art, Science, and Epistemology

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you bring an artistic aspect to science. We are living through the ultimate expression of science without art. How important is merging those two worlds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you investigate the epistemology supporting science, you run into absolute junk. The most trivial arguments and beliefs support reductionist science. If you examine your experience and the causes of your experience, you're doing the fundamentals that *should* be behind science, but it's considered subjective and artistic.

**Danny Roddy:** When you look at J.C. Bose, Albert Szent-Györgyi, or Otto Warburg, do you find a through-line of artistic expression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and humor is something lacking in ordinary science. They can't afford the amount of truth needed to experience humor.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think Szent-Györgyi said he wasn't surprised people were sick; he was surprised they were alive at all given how bad the situation was.

**Danny Roddy:** When reading their work, can you sense if someone is an artist or an analytical type?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what studying literature and linguistics does. You can detect hot air after the first two or three sentences.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Assertiveness is a dead giveaway. When they tell you something is 100% truth with no room to question. Do you think a sign of pathology is the excessive abstractness or mathematization of a field?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. The kind of mathematization that involves digitalizing everything. That was one of the deepest hidden principles of the deep state: to support digitalized reality behind science. No analogs of reality, because those allow participation. The most authoritarian reasoning comes from computable, purified symbolic manipulation. Symbols are ultimately without meaning because meaning tends towards holism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would Chomsky or von Neumann say to the proof that reality is non-computable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He would say your mentality is so inferior you don't belong at MIT. When I was a linguistics major in the late 50s, I saw what Chomsky was doing as probably the most evil man in the world at that time because of the thoroughness with which he said language is a matter of abstract categories born into our genes.

## Synchronicity and Intuition

**Danny Roddy:** People have asked for Ray to talk more about synchronicity. Does William James' radical empiricism relate to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Undoubtedly, because it's the way things are. You can't recognize synchronicity if you aren't open to reality.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there predetermination in that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there are formative principles, like morphogenic fields, that incline people to put themselves in situations where coincidences become more likely to be recognized as productive discoveries.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've noticed routine is a great way to destroy synchronicity. Being spontaneous tends to increase such events.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's right.

## Red Light Therapy

**Danny Roddy:** Incandescent red light versus single wavelength devices. People sell single wavelength devices for extraordinary money.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you analyze the physics of electronic and optical resonance, it instantly goes beyond physics. Specific frequencies just never existed in nature. The whole system experiences something new when you hit an absorptive molecule with a single frequency. The fine structure of the resonance is always going to be unnatural. There is data showing that the incandescent or sunlight type of absorption can make cancer grow, but no one has ever seen those effects from a full spectrum.

## Progesterone and Liver Health

**Danny Roddy:** How is progesterone helpful specifically for the liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By optimizing the degree of excitation of cells. The same transmitters that cause brain damage—excitotoxic glutamate—will cause excitatory damage to the liver. Estrogen, PUFA, and glutamic acid are defended against by progesterone. Progesterone also favors thyroid hormone production. Thyroid-deficient people have liver malfunctions, including gallbladder disease. Progesterone relaxes those spastic reactions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a paper suggesting low thyroid could be a pseudo-liver disease. The hepatocytes cannot function properly without thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver's energy is used to regulate environmental toxins and balance hormones. When thyroid is low, the liver doesn't have the ability to inactivate and excrete toxins, so they accumulate.

**Danny Roddy:** Random question: Do you have a special process for making oat bran?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Whatever tastes best. I like to add a little masa to it; it gives it a rounder flavor, sort of like tamales.

## Dietetics as Political Control

**Danny Roddy:** Could you ask him about dietetics as a form of political control?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** "Diet for a Small Planet" popularized the idea that you should economize by making foods overlap. It's a possible diet, but they neglect the toxic aspects of a high-vegetable diet.

**Danny Roddy:** Didn't Plato talk about slaves eating bread?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Spanish enslaving the Mexican Indians put them on a minimal diet of beans and tortillas. It saved money and weakened them to prevent rebellion.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Wasn't that also a technique of Christian missionaries? Convincing indigenous tribes they are sinners and need to eat crappy foods to weaken the population?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were the political wings of the Spanish empire.

## Abiotic Oil

**Danny Roddy:** Can you talk about abiotic oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mendeleev was the first to notice it. He dissolved iron in sulfuric acid and noticed an oily film that smelled like petroleum. The idea is that iron dissolves carbon at a high level, and when it decomposes in acid, it spontaneously synthesizes that carbon. Geologists' consensus is that the center of the earth has a high concentration of iron. The capacity of that iron to dissolve carbon amounts to vast amounts of potential petroleum.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you see the news that they found oceans of oil and liquid methane on Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons? It throws a wrench into the dead dinosaur theory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Russian research showed the fossil fuel idea has no basis in science. It's extremely probable that it's a natural geological consequence.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you suspect a political motive in pushing the fossil fuel theory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, fostered stupidity. Oil companies want to maximize price by making the public fear it's running out.

## Wilhelm Reich and Psychoanalysis

**Danny Roddy:** What does Ray think of Reich's Cloudbuster?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think he was obsessed with the misconception.

**Danny Roddy:** He writes so vitriolically about communism. Why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was his early experience with the Nazis. He was activating the "Sex-Pol" movement—sexual freedom associated with political freedom. To the Nazis, that was considered a variation on communism. The stress of being exiled and pursued affected his judgment. At one point in prison, he heard an airplane and said it was President Eisenhower watching him.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think Freud's psychoanalysis is a way of concealing the real source of mental health problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reich goes into that. Freud chose to be on the side of the super-ego against the revolutionary truth of organismic perceptions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It makes you dependent on the person with esoteric knowledge.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically authoritarianism. Reich realized Freud was fraudulent in choosing authoritarianism rather than liberation.

**Danny Roddy:** Did Freud have deep state connections?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not directly. He saw where his income was coming from—the middle class.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The CIA psychologists in Project MKUltra used heavy Freudian underpinnings—shaming people, keeping them naked.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It seemed especially directed to the highly moralistic Islamic culture.

## Gender Relations and Transhumanism

**Danny Roddy:** Ray has sounded pro-polygamy before. What does he think of gender relations today?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Being in a healthy economic social environment is the first step. Marriage evolved from property rights. As those were questioned, new problems developed. You have to look at what society and economics are doing. There is still a financial interest involved—rich people marry rich people.

**Danny Roddy:** How does disappearing women as a protected class and surgeries on minors serve particular interests?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same forces that create a doctrine of randomness. If you can choose your gender, it's the same as having the random determination of all your properties. It isn't going out of your interior nature. Denying the reality of biology fits with authoritarian randomness.

**Danny Roddy:** Is this preparing people for a transhumanist agenda?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically digitalizing society so you can be assigned a code number or gender role that supersedes your actual needs.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think the rise of transgenderism is a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life. Rates of these issues have been rising since the 60s due to stress, poor diet, and estrogenic drugs.

**Danny Roddy:** Is merging man and machine just ludicrous?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All this talk about biologically compatible materials is phoniness. Ray Kurzweil, the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think he damaged his spinal cord or something. He doesn't want to be bothered by it anymore.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray believe in the renewal of life through a purgatory function of nature? Is it worth sacrificing systems for new fertile cycles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The principle of fertilizing through death has its function, but the idea of sacrificing something existing for something that *might* develop... often the priests are calling on you to sacrifice for something that benefits them.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you ask him about stars being conscious?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I don't know of any source on that.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Some of the orderly signals they are publicizing exhibit patterns reminiscent of intelligence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything is orderly. Complex ordering exists everywhere. I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.

**Danny Roddy:** The newsletter is available by email at rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. You can also order Ray's books there. Progesterone is available at ketogen@gmail.com. Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The new perspective on the etiology of cancer—putting it in the same context as COVID, infectious diseases, and aging. Getting away from the mutation origin of cancer. It's a disease that causes a mutation rather than mutation causing the disease.

**Danny Roddy:** Amazing. Thank you, Ray and Georgi. Have a safe weekend.
