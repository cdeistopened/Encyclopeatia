---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, Generative Energy number 85, and we have Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov on the line. Ray, how are you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Danny Roddy:** Thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate it, even with the time mishap. I hope you had time to drink your coffee.

## Protein Intake and Methionine Restriction

**Danny Roddy:** I've listened to the bits about protein that you've been talking about, and I thought anchoring the show in that would be interesting. I'm not necessarily looking for you to tell everybody how much protein to eat per se. As long as I've been following your work, you've referenced that 1999 military study suggesting 80 to 100 grams of protein per person, and occasionally you'd say maybe even more would be better. I'm interested in how you shifted your thinking on this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It really started in the 1970s. I was volunteering for a free clinic in Eugene. At that time, they were burning grass fields for lawn seed production, and everyone had respiratory disease because of the constant summer smoke. I had found that stopping certain supplements greatly reduced my allergies. I suggested that to the allergy patients at the clinic, since everyone was taking every conceivable supplement with no benefit. All of them got over their symptoms despite the field burning continuing.

They asked, "If that silly idea worked, what other ideas do you have?" I said, "Stop eating toxic junk like tofu, bean salad with lettuce and cucumbers, various seeds, and indigestible material—all the stylish, hippie stuff. Stop eating that and just try milk, cheese, eggs, and meat—a more digestible diet."

Everyone did, and they said, "Oh, the wonders of a high-protein diet." It wasn't high-protein; it was just low junk food—specifically uncooked, indigestible materials. It wasn't intended as a specially high-protein diet, but for years people ate a healthy diet and it was considered high-protein. If you're an active person in your 20s, you're very likely to be burning 4,000 or 5,000 calories per day. So, 100 grams of protein in a 5,000-calorie diet with lots of carbohydrates isn't a bad ratio at all.

**Danny Roddy:** So to you, maybe there hasn't really been a shift, and that's just a perception of the listeners. For many years you have been talking about the restriction of essential amino acids. Methionine restriction in animals increased their lifespan by 40%, and you get an additional percentage for restricting cysteine and tryptophan.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's extremely life-extending to limit certain essential amino acids. Broda Barnes noticed something about 50 years ago. He tried a high-protein diet, and for years he had been taking two grains of Armour thyroid every day. On increasing the meat in his diet, he had to take four grains of Armour to maintain his functions.

So those two things have been out there as items of interest: the methionine restriction for longevity, and the anti-thyroid effect of generally higher protein. There are also the life-extending benefits of the immunosuppressive target of rapamycin inhibitors. The rapamycin type of antibiotic suppresses growth—called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)—and that explains a big part of the mechanism behind methionine restriction longevity and protein inhibition of energy production.

**Danny Roddy:** So you're saying blocking the mTOR pathway is life-extending?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, inhibiting that is good.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Some of the main arguments of the caloric restriction crowd is that that's precisely why they advocate people eating less—up to 40 to 50 percent less calories—because that blocks the mTOR pathway and activates PGC-1-alpha.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't actually calories; it's the anti-metabolic effect of those specific amino acids.

## Adjusting Protein for Age and Health

**Danny Roddy:** Maybe five years ago you wrote to somebody saying you didn't feel right with 120 grams of protein. Was that something personal you experienced, leading you to think methionine was more thyroid-suppressive than you originally thought?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around the age of 30, everyone's mitochondria are being suppressed. Your metabolism is much slower after middle age, which means it is much more susceptible to being suppressed by those unnecessary amino acids.

**Danny Roddy:** So if you're young, you could need the normal 100 grams of protein, but in later age you don't need as much—maybe 50 grams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. The ability to metabolize carbohydrates goes up as you reduce your protein suppression of metabolism.

**Danny Roddy:** What about sick people? Should they reduce their protein intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For example, having fruit juice when you're sick—a very high carbohydrate diet—is very protective. A lot of that is because the proteins, even though they're anti-inflammatory for your digestive system, if they're beyond that very low level—maybe 50 grams a day—they're going to slow your metabolism.

**Danny Roddy:** Would this be a useful tool for a person to regain their health: trying different amounts of protein, including lower amounts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, but especially different amounts of carbohydrate and different types.

**Georgi Dinkov:** This reminds me of the experiment the Russians did showing that you can survive and thrive on a diet of nothing but potatoes and butter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone since Adelle Davis has commented on how well so many old people do living on tea and toast, or Jell-O and toast. That's the real Peat diet.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What can one do to limit the dangers of starch in well-cooked potatoes? We don't want the persorption. Is butter the main protective factor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, combined thorough cooking with a little butter to assure its breakdown.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, for yourself, how did you arrive at 50 grams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just that it's hard to eat less. Even with the juices, as you reach a gallon of orange juice, your protein is going up considerably. That's fairly difficult to do. You have to modulate your milk and meat intake. Even though calcium in milk helps keep your thyroid function going, you have to limit your milk, cheese, and egg intake, and even well-cooked vegetables.

**Danny Roddy:** Was the grape juice useful for this new experiment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does have a huge amount of carbohydrate. You have to be careful because it can osmotically upset your digestion. I can only tolerate two or three ounces at a time.

**Danny Roddy:** How many carbohydrates are you eating? Maybe well over 500 grams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just about in that range, 500 or 600 grams.

**Danny Roddy:** Mainly from orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, a lot of very well-cooked vegetables just for taste variety. I just can't gag down that much grape juice and orange juice.

**Danny Roddy:** How has this changed your liver consumption? Do you eat less liver each week?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very much less. Currently, it's hard to get good organic liver, such as chicken liver. Whenever that's available we'll have some chicken livers with bacon, but that might be only once in two months.

**Danny Roddy:** Why would the change in dietary macro ratios change your liver intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Liver is a huge source of methionine. Probably ten years ago, I ate eight ounces of liver and felt real cold afterwards, and the next day felt especially hypothyroid.

**Danny Roddy:** What is the specific mechanism by which methionine suppresses thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of things. I don't know what the most important mechanism is.

## Brain Metabolism and Symptoms

**Danny Roddy:** I've noticed that people with a physically larger brain might notice symptoms really quickly. They have high energy requirements, and if those weren't met, they would notice nuanced symptoms. Could you speak about brain metabolism and noticing symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain requires a steady supply of glycogen and glucose. Excited thinking can consume really large amounts of sugar.

You can check your pulse pressure—the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. If everything is running smoothly with enough blood sugar, you'll have a systolic that's about 50 points higher than the diastolic. But if you're having a problem with your glucose, you're going to have an increased difference, maybe 75 points.

If you get in that condition from excitation or whatever cause that depletes your systemic glycogen, you can check your pulse pressure frequently while increasing your glucose and starch intake. You can tell when you have replenished the glycogen source because suddenly your difference between systolic and diastolic will come down to 40 or 45 points.

**Danny Roddy:** Would someone with a low rate of metabolism, or who has had toxic insults, not notice these defects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Georgi Dinkov:** People that take SSRI drugs are prone to self-harm and getting wounds that they ignore because they never felt the pain. I've noticed people taking these drugs often have wounds and scrapes that look ghastly, and they only notice them when I point them out.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That sort of thing is eventually corrected by keeping your thyroid chronically a lot higher.

## Liver Function and Glycogen

**Danny Roddy:** I'm talking to people who can take 200 milligrams of Progest-E with no effect, but they benefit from antibiotics like tetracyclines. What is a good strategy for someone with a nitric oxide problem where their liver is not responding to progesterone? Would a small amount of T3 be useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Everything is involved—nervous system, hormones, digestive enzyme balance. The helpless cholinergic reflexes interfere with everything good, making more nitric oxide and causing inflammatory damage.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there something else useful for that situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Looking at the whole picture to see what you're in most desperate need of.

**Danny Roddy:** Would reducing protein be useful for someone with liver disease who isn't responding to progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and that can be quickly repaired by getting the glycogen up. The liver turns off just like the brain if it hasn't stored enough glycogen. That is often a matter of two or three days.

**Danny Roddy:** Glycogenesis can't happen without T3, progesterone, and enough carbohydrate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Nicotine and the Cholinergic System

**Georgi Dinkov:** Since you mentioned the cholinergic system, do you think that's the main risk of people using nicotine? It is a direct activator of the acetylcholine receptors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's likely. It's part of your cholinergic system, and you can't be sure how the nicotine is going to fit into the anti-inflammatory system. It has that potential, but it can do the opposite too and turn on cancer metabolism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why do you think tobacco consumption is so widespread among indigenous cultures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because of its stimulating value. Psychologically, it can tone things up and make you function.

## Methylation and Hair Loss

**Danny Roddy:** Does methionine relate to estrogen and serotonin? Does it tend to increase them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It has a demobilizing function. The methyl groups are in a constant battle. There's been too much emphasis on people who don't have enough methyl groups and not enough on the danger of an excess methyl pressure.

**Danny Roddy:** What do you think about lidocaine as a topical for hair loss?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's generally self-protective. Since it works for all kinds of serious conditions, even helping with cancer and brain injury, it's almost always a good thing to try. It prevents energy waste.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding scalp massage for hair growth, what specifically were you talking about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a very gentle massage, such as gently rubbing oil into it. You don't want to cause inflammation.

**Danny Roddy:** The mechanism might be increasing blood flow?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Feeling good is a good way to increase blood flow. If you increase blood flow by irritation, that's because you're doing damage that causes lactic acid production. A very soft, stimulating, pleasure-giving massage is the opposite of a rough, irritating massage.

## Thyroid Dosing

**Danny Roddy:** The most common thing with thyroid dosing is overdosing. People often start with a whole tablet of Cynoplus and Cynomel. We've talked about 10 micrograms of T3 being a limit. What happens when you take 15 or 20?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After maybe 10 or 12 hours after that overdose, you have plunged to a hypothyroid state. If you're dosing only once or twice a day, those ups and downs become extreme and can do things like stopping your heart rate when your thyroid dips sharply.

**Danny Roddy:** For a person with liver disease, do they do better on smaller doses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, smaller. I think no one should supplement thyroid until they've read at least one of Broda Barnes' books.

**Danny Roddy:** I've started recommending people buy milligram scales to measure powdered Cynomel tablets to get accurate microgram doses. Is that a good idea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure whether they're actually going to be getting the right amount of T3. If it's well distributed in the tablet, powdering a Cynomel tablet and figuring that you're taking two or three micrograms at a time puts you in the least danger of suppression.

**Danny Roddy:** So there could be a huge amount of T3 on one side of the pill?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's conceivable.

**Danny Roddy:** If a person wants to go for accuracy with a scale, is that misleading?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's misleading because your body isn't that accurate. The body responds very differently every time. There's no scale equivalent in the body. You have to go by the feeling—your temperature, pulse rate, and feeling.

## Geopolitics and Collapse

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to get your update on the cultural situation. Do you still think things are going to plan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not our plan—the oligarchs' insane psycho plan.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think their plan is failing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything they're doing is becoming stupid and obvious, but they have rigged it so that stupid and obvious aren't impediments. The banks say there's simply no alternative to digital money. It takes time to write the programs to manage all the money in the world in a stereotyped manner so that no one has actual money, but everyone is on a retainer. They're intending it to come out in two or three years. They have created a mass dementia where people can't even begin to think about how to get out of that deadly fate.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A more direct question: Russia and China have solidified their union. The BRICS organization is about to launch its own currency backed by commodities. What do you think is going to happen over the next six to 12 months in the West regarding food and energy? Are we looking at a mass famine event?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The production of grain by Ukraine and Russia is still there, so the worst of starvation in the southern world can be alleviated. But everything is going to be under maximum tension. The only thing keeping away a terminal starvation condition is the success of the Russian-Chinese-Third World axis. They are on the threshold of a successful world economy. The main danger is that the West can't see any non-demented solutions, so they're increasingly likely to resort to nuclear weapons.

**Georgi Dinkov:** We're basically looking at World War III because the West is out of options. The economy of the West is done. Do you foresee things getting rougher over the next six to 12 months?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the West is just committed to everything getting worse.

**Danny Roddy:** You echoed Gonzalo Lira, who said the only thing the US could do is use nuclear weapons. Do you think that is a plausible scenario?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the state of dementia that they have created for themselves leads almost inexorably to that.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does your animal instinct—the first signal system—tell you right now that the West is done?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I never hear Lira say anything wrong.

**Danny Roddy:** If he's right, things are going to get significantly worse fast.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's approximately the schedule that is inevitable.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you bought any canned food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the cans are a nuisance. I always have a barrel of coconut oil, some powdered milk, and a lot of grains.

**Danny Roddy:** And sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar, basically white sugar.

**Danny Roddy:** The low protein stuff is actually pretty useful entering into a dystopian future. If you just avoided the methionine, the PUFA, the iron, and food additives, you could probably feel relatively okay.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Possibly.

**Danny Roddy:** One last thing about nuclear war. Have you made any preparations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just to drive south as quickly as possible. The clouds will concentrate over the northern hemisphere.

**Danny Roddy:** In Mexico, would Michoacan be the best place?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think for the present, Michoacan is good. High altitude, moderate rainfall.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would be some remedies for low-level radiation exposure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a greenhouse, heating it with fossil fuels so that you avoid strontium fallout and get stable calcium. Avoid vegetables that are growing right after the fallout.

**Georgi Dinkov:** That would include animal food too, right? Because radiation concentrates in bones and fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Old food—dehydrated or canned foods—are the first thing to use.

**Danny Roddy:** What about the cartels in a dystopian future?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cartels are just effectively capital. There's not going to be anything particularly bad about what they do. If the drug market disappears, the cartels will have to find another job, which probably involves working the land and doing something productive.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** Let's do the advertisement real fast. The newsletter is available by email now. You can also order Ray's books by emailing rayPeats@gmail.com. Georgi, do you have a progesterone story?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yes. A person in Europe was diagnosed with liver tumors. A biopsy showed one nodule was malignant. He took the equivalent of about a teaspoon of Progest-E daily for two weeks. The malignant nodule completely disappeared. Of the four remaining benign nodules, three disappeared and the last one shrunk to the size of a pinhead.

**Danny Roddy:** Amazing. Hey Georgi, Ray, thank you so much for doing this. We'll talk to you guys soon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, bye.
