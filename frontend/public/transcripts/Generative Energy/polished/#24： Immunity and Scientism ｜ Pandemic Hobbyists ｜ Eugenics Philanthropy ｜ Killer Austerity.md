---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, we are live on YouTube. Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov. Ray, I interrupted you. You were saying some really important, critical things and I want to get those on record. I was asking you initially about China, Brzezinski, the Rockefeller Technocratic Society. You were mentioning Event 201, Fort Detrick, and the culmination of larger global plans pushing society in a specific direction that has been talked about for a long time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a commission on defense preparations using artificial intelligence that came out about two years ago. It said that at the rate the Chinese economy has been growing, the world will be centered on Chinese production and the development of artificial automation and automatic factories. The U.S., for various reasons, would not be able to keep up with that extrapolated progress.

The only way this commission could see to prevent China from taking over the world in ten years would be to stop the world economy as a whole—turn off and ruin the whole world economy.

Then these other things—claiming that there was a virus released last November, doing the news releases of a leaky lab, and Fort Detrick preparing pathogens—all of that reinforced by China's cooperation in creating that huge quarantine, was acting out the plan to ruin the world economy as a way to save the ruling system. It is to keep the U.S. empire intact by ruining everything, meaning ruining small business primarily, so that there can be an immediate takeover by monopoly corporations and finance. It simplifies the whole economy with basically everyone being a low-wage employee, but working to overtake China on the matter of artificial intelligence production.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question here. Let's say China becomes the leader in artificial intelligence; what are those 1.4 billion people there going to do? What do you think China's idea of its own population would be? How would they participate if eventually everything becomes automated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure they've thought about that, but they have a basically humane concept of how capitalism is working. They have actually almost succeeded in eliminating poverty. China was one of the poorest countries when they started, and they have seriously brought up the lowest economic category.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Okay. So basically, this event is similar to that quote you gave once about the Vietnamese and the Americans saying, "We have to destroy this village to save it." They're doing the same thing now with the world economy—to save it from the Chinese, they have to destroy it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So I was a little bit wrong. They're not in solidarity with China. They're doing all these things to protect what they've built. Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. They were taking profits from the industry in China but reached a point where they saw that China as an economy was becoming the center of the world, making the world dependent on their production. That was structurally interfering with the U.S. idea of empire, in which military bases were the essence of organization, whereas the Chinese were making the flow of goods the means of organization.

## Technocracy and Economic Control

**Danny Roddy:** What does quarantine and lockdown—presuming that's towards a depopulation type of effort—what does that have to do with maintaining the empire? Are the citizenry getting out of control and that's why they have to put these ridiculous measures in place to clamp down on the people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's part of it—to justify taking over the internet, requiring vaccination and subordination of all sorts. But I think mostly it's part of destroying all of the middle-class competition for the giant monopolies.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think technocracy is a worthwhile concept? Is that useful for explaining what's going on? Was it coined by Brzezinski in *Between Two Ages*?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh no. Veblen was the first person who started talking about how you could eliminate labor and create abundance. Then the people who called themselves "Technocrats Incorporated" started; the founder of technocracy knew Veblen and adopted his view of the economy.

**Danny Roddy:** Did you know any of the old technocrats used to drive grey cars with the yellow and red yin-yang symbol on the side?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I didn't know that. People thought they were maybe fascist sympathizers, but they were actually just very naive about how the world works. They took these calculations from Veblen and subsequent economists like John Maynard Keynes. In 1930, Keynes wrote an article saying that by 2030—100 years from when he wrote it—discounting plagues and world wars, people won't be working any more than 15 hours a week.

When I was a kid, that was part of the environment. The work week was getting shorter and that was the predicted future. It wasn't just the technocracy people by name, but they were outstanding in how optimistic they were that the people who owned things were going to let the engineers run them intelligently and efficiently. That constantly ran into interference with the concentration of wealth and control.

The progress towards the 15-hour week was more or less continuous despite those interferences. In 1980, that was the turning point. Reagan and the progress of the middle and working class took a sharp turn. The GDP kept increasing, productivity kept increasing, but wages started decreasing. The upper 1% and 1/10th of 1% started getting all of the rewards of increasing production.

**Danny Roddy:** I was listening to a conversation between Patrick Wood and James Corbett. Patrick Wood has written a few books on technocracy. He pointed out that originally it was more like a Buckminster Fuller type of future. Rockefeller and Brzezinski co-opted the term for their dystopian, *Brave New World* type of future.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, definitely. It started with the CIA, Eisenhower, and the Green Revolution. It was being applied in agriculture, turning farming into agribusiness and agri-industry rather than producing mixed foods for consumption. It was producing soybeans for profit. That started with Rockefeller and Eisenhower in 1952.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question. If agriculture has been so industrialized to mostly focus on profit and not necessarily produce the foods that people need, then how come it needs such massive subsidies from the government? I live in DC and I know some people involved in lobbying on behalf of agricultural organizations. They're saying that if these farmers, no matter how massive they are in the Midwest, don't get their government subsidies even one season, they're going under.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government has been financing the upward distribution of ownership in all sorts of ways. The funds going to people owning only 10,000 acres was slowing the progress of the great technocrats. They're going to let those so-called "relatively small" farms of 10,000 or 15,000 acres go under to be consumed by the ones controlling a million acres.

## Media Disinformation and Health Statistics

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, in one of your newsletters, you quoted Gore Vidal saying, "The people have no voice because they have no information." That reminded me of William Casey, the CIA director in 1981, who said, "Our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false." What is your take, having a wide perspective, on how the news has changed over time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The public news is getting more controlling, more false, and dumbed down so that they're just giving instructions every day on what you should believe. It's horrifyingly effective with this plague thing, how people fell for it. Without any data at all, the decisions were made that a new kind of coronavirus was very infectious and very deadly. No data in support.

My first thought was, do they have guilty insider information that it was designed in the lab and they *know* that to be the case? If they weren't the designers of it, there is no sane reason for saying it's very infectious or very dangerous, because they just weren't doing the tests to see what was making people sick or measuring the changes of sickness in relation to previous years.

I was looking at the CDC's report, and all of their actual cases, infections, and deaths were right on the typical flu season mortality, sickness, and hospitalization. As the tests became available by the millions around the first of April, suddenly flu mortality dropped as fast as the stock market had fallen earlier. It was like a cliff falling off. As the millions of tests became available, the steep rise of the news talked about a sudden, gigantic speed of communication causing this vertical rise in the incidents and deaths from the coronavirus. But the bigger curve of general respiratory mortality was right on previous year patterns. It was just coronavirus replacing influenza, syncytial, and other respiratory viruses.

When the vaccine became available, the official definition of polio was changed, and other conditions that had been causing paralysis suddenly disappeared. As polio was epidemic, things like aseptic meningitis were rising to replace the disappearing polio. In other words, the definition was the only thing that changed. Paralysis stayed the same. If you eliminated polio by saying that it didn't fit the definition of what was causing paralysis, then the vaccine could get the credit for it.

The same thing was done in the opposite direction with cancer from the 1940s through the 1950s. They increased the definition of cancer of the breast and uterus, for example. Things that had been non-cancer became cancer. If you cure all of these cases of non-cancer, it shows that your treatment is effective. But if you look at the actual death from cancer, the deaths increased exactly at the speed that the treatment for cancer increased. By definition, they were having a tremendous success in curing cancer by creating a strawman of disease and curing it, but meanwhile, the bystander patient was dying at a higher rate. I think that accounts for why the coronavirus deaths are tending to displace flu virus deaths.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the Chinese are aware that this has been dropped at their doorstep as a warning, they must have done some testing internally and probably confirmed that this is not nearly as dangerous as what we hear on TV. Do you think they took the bait and quarantined the entire country? Was it an exercise in their own police state for future purposes, or were they really concerned that maybe this could have unforeseen lethality later down the road?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far as I can tell, it could be either of those equally.

## Surveillance and Control

**Danny Roddy:** What do you make of the flip-flopping of the WHO saying masks don't help, then saying you must wear a mask? How could that happen? Were they just not coordinated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. They didn't plan it all out with that meeting that came up with Event 201. They left some details that were sloppy.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you talk a little bit more about Event 201 and the "Lockstep" scenario narratives from the Rockefeller Foundation? Harry Vox predicted this in 2014. Why are they doing these scenarios?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think Harry Vox is right. You can't imagine them as being more evil than they really are. We're always short in our estimation of how bad they are.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a more sinister explanation. Now that everything is being monitored online, they probably have a list of people who are reading between the lines and realizing what's really going on. It's very similar to the leaders of the Occupy Wall Street movement; they had snipers ready to take them out. I guarantee you that we are all on some kind of list if we fit the profile of people reading these documents.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think doing everything possible on the internet and telephones is important, but besides that, people have to start actually getting in touch personally and passing messages personally, organizing on the ground level.

My experience in the past, just trying to go abroad to teach, involves surveillance. One of my old friends turned out to be my overseer for some government agency. He said he would tell me when we retired, but he died before retiring. His wife confirmed that he was in surveillance. Every time I would have an idea, like to go teach in Nicaragua or El Salvador, he would somehow locate me, even though I hadn't kept in touch and didn't have a telephone. He would find my address and say, "Don't do it."

He was one of the union people from the Northwest. We knew him as a fanatical anti-marijuana person because he knew that would be used to damage the union workers. But the night before he was to fly to San Salvador with the other union guys, his apartment was raided, marijuana was planted, and he was put in jail to miss his flight. The guys that went there were sitting in a restaurant starting to get organized, and the army murdered them all. So my view was that he had his friend somewhere in the government that protected him by having him framed.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the writings of Kay Griggs? She was married to a high-level NATO official and said verbatim what you just did—that people would randomly break into apartments as a message saying, "Be mindful of what you're saying because we can frame you."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Being nearsighted and generally absent-minded, I never would notice things. But whenever this guy who was my surveillance person was with me, I would come back to the school, put my key in the lock, and find shreds of paraffin on it. I said, "What was that?" He said, "Oh, sometimes they do that to make a copy of your key so they can break in."

Other times I wasn't noticing someone being like a "clown" surveillance person—doing a show of being sneaky but looking ridiculous, hiding behind a skinny light post. I wouldn't have noticed it except my friend pointed it out. Then the guy wrote a number in the dust of my windshield and disappeared. My friend said, "That looks like an immigration tourist card number." I pulled out my tourist card and it was my immigration number.

## Bill Gates and Medical Power

**Danny Roddy:** Can we talk a little bit about Bill Gates' role? A Politico article calls him "the world's most powerful doctor."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He likes to hobnob with the very top bankers, the Rockefellers and Rothschild types. I think he's in the network—CIA, IBM—creating his business and his billions. He's right from the start knowing somewhat what the scheme is. But he's sort of a microcephalic type who follows orders but doesn't do much else.

**Danny Roddy:** It's funny because my dad worked for IBM and all I heard growing up was what a son of a bitch Bill Gates was. It's funny he's reformed his image as this Christ-like savior with vaccines.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and public health. Rockefeller got poor people to wear shoes in the South and did lots of good things.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I always thought that a "powerful doctor" is a contradiction of terms. A powerful doctor to me would mean somebody who cured cancer. My doctor friends said, "No, a powerful doctor means someone who has the potential of one day being either the president or running global health."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And the world economy is part of world health. You want to keep people just sick enough that they have to consume the drugs and be under the control of the doctors and the drug companies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think they've improved the science to the point where they can say, on average, we can control how long a person lives and exactly when they die?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When someone is in the hands of a healthcare system where the military, the insurance company, or the healthcare corporation is responsible for their final sickness, it's well established that the final sickness is the most economical disposition. Morphine is the standard treatment for cancer even though it's recognized for at least 100 years that it makes cancer grow faster. But it's a very cheap way to finish them off and save money.

## Vaccines and Fertility

**Danny Roddy:** In an old interview, Bill Gates says his dad was head of Planned Parenthood. Then a picture surfaced with Anthony Fauci, William H. Gates, David Rockefeller, and Soros.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fauci is another person that follows orders and administers punishment and knows how to very efficiently, bluntly, and crudely make things look right on the surface while stealing people's ideas and blocking their research.

**Danny Roddy:** An article in 2014 said, "Kenyan doctors find anti-fertility agent in UN tetanus vaccine." This vaccine was laced with HCG. Given your understanding of endocrinology, do you think the underlying idea behind vaccination is sterilization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, they found HCG in some of the African vaccines. It's known that will sterilize you at least for a few years. The CIA doesn't announce that they're doing it, but they plan for its possibility, and then someone always figures out how to sneak it out into the world.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think Gates is determined to give people vaccines just to make them sicker, or is there a specific nefarious purpose like anti-fertility?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. I think his background in population control is right there on the surface. The idea of preventing epidemics by the old Rockefeller idea of giving people shoes and food is now too expensive. Vaccines are a matter of economy. The known effects of vitamin A and vitamin D making massive improvements in disease resistance—that's more expensive than a vaccine, not even counting the depopulation effects.

**Georgi Dinkov:** That Kenyan article only talks about vaccinating girls, and HCG has a known anti-fertility effect in girls. But apparently, it works in boys too. If a male buys a pregnancy test and it comes back positive, that is a biomarker for testicular cancer. Levels of HCG are elevated in males with testicular cancer. Conversely, research suggests if a male chronically uses HCG, they may give themselves testicular cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's dangerous stuff. I've been warning people not to use it as a diet weight loss method because of that effect on estrogen and cancer.

**Danny Roddy:** Are its effects similar to the Human Growth Hormone (HGH)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not exactly. HGH has its age-promoting effect, thickening the basement membranes and imitating age changes. But chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) increases estrogen production, and estrogen is produced by any type of cell in the body. So you don't want to have untimely stimulation of estrogen.

## Epstein and the Elite

**Danny Roddy:** I'm looking at a picture of John D. Rockefeller, Brzezinski, and Soros. Why do you think these people aesthetically look evil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the old women in that picture with the Rockefellers and other giants of civilization... Hollywood couldn't design evil characters as well as that.

**Danny Roddy:** Someone mentioned that this whole thing is similar to AIDS. I'm looking at a *Life* magazine cover from 1985 saying "Now no one is safe from AIDS."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I don't think there's much similarity except that they both damage your immunity and make you sick. Did I ever tell you the story of the guy from Fort Detrick that told me about the AIDS research 11 or 12 years before AIDS broke out? In 1969, this guy came to one of my free university classes. He said he had quit his job at Fort Detrick because the people were seriously designing a virus that would be racially selective to kill black people specifically. At that time, nothing had been published on ethnic magnetic tags that a virus could attach to, but two or three years later, the first papers were published coming out of Fort Detrick—exactly what he had said, but without the purpose defined. My molecular biology professors honored those as great progress in science.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think the plan changed from creating a virus to kill specific groups to a dysgenics kind of thing of poisoning everybody?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the plan is constantly developing.

**Danny Roddy:** According to the *New York Times*, Bill Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein many times. What do you make of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The worship of power. Epstein flaunted his connections with power. He knew everyone powerful, and that attracted Bill Gates. I think the CIA has tried to infiltrate itself into every conceivable cultish movement. Probably the pedophiles are being manipulated by the CIA as much as the religious groups.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think Ghislaine Maxwell is pretty obviously an Israeli intelligence asset. Her job was probably to collect compromising information on all of the pedophiles visiting the ranch. I wouldn't be surprised if they have a video on most of the powerful people in the world right now.

## Viruses, Exosomes, and Transmission

**Danny Roddy:** Can we talk about transmission of disease? Is the transmission of viruses just an inherent property of human communication? What do you make of the idea that if I go outside and have coronavirus, I'm going to "kill grandma"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mechanism by which the virus reproduces itself involves going in and activating the enzymes that copy the RNA and make the proteins that form the capsule. Then vast numbers pour out through the endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted. That mechanism is already making retrovirus particles that, under a microscope and by chemical analysis, are structural analogs of the various virus particles.

They only began to be really studied at the beginning of this century—exosomes, microvesicles. But the serum and the lymph are really full of them. Under an ordinary microscope, they're basically invisible dust, but when you look closely, they are highly organized vesicles with RNA, DNA, enzymes, and lipids.

It is thought that maybe half of our DNA collection consists of things that structurally look like retroviral copied DNA. When we're under stress, we pour out large quantities of these exosomes that are thought to be a communication between different tissues. For example, an injured lung will send exosomes that are absorbed by bone marrow cells, which then make a particular kind of white blood cell capable of repairing the lung.

They are abundantly present in maternal milk and are taken up through the intestine wall as immune support for the baby. They are known to be able to enter the gonads in a way that would make them candidates for what Darwin called "gemmules." He thought they accounted for the inheritance of acquired properties.

Bacteria can make particles like this, which they transmit through a tube to other bacteria that lack a resistance factor. It's a genetic interchange between species to share acquired information. Since we can use it within the organism, I think individuals probably habitually share stuff like this. For example, you can find the DNA from a woman's previous partners in her tissues. I think that since the gonads are known to take up these exosomes, the semen will probably be found to contain lots of these exosomes, which look like and are structured like viruses.

I think when an animal is very sick, it's known that the exosomes participate in amplifying the sickness instead of correcting it. The serum from an old animal accelerates aging of a young animal. It's probably the presence of harmful exosomes. I think it's reasonable that sometimes these exosomes of stressed individuals become toxic enough that that would account for where viruses came from.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think it's fair to say that viruses are basically a very efficient way of horizontal gene transfer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. Within organisms that's established, but I think organisms other than bacteria are doing it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If their purpose is communication, would it make sense to say that if an organism is very stressed and producing a lot of these viruses, that would be a signal to the organisms surrounding it that the environment is suboptimal so that those organisms can mount a defensive response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right, just like bacteria. When you're healthy—like 80% of the people who contract coronavirus don't even notice it—I think they're potentially constructive assistance improving our immune system.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There are older studies showing that nurses working in specific wards tend to come down with the exact same diseases of the people they're taking care of. Do you think that may be explainable by this communication mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's basically my interpretation and why I don't worry about this particular type of respiratory infection.

## The Microbiome

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was reading an article suggesting that the story with the microbiome is similar to the story with "essential fatty acids." It looks like there is no evidence that the microbiome in people is obligate. When journalists interviewed scientists, they said having a microbiome in nature is the exception rather than the rule.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Back when many people were healthy, the small intestine was known to be sterile all the way from the mouth to the cecum. Now, something like 80% or 90% have bacteria living way up to the duodenum. There is a lot of information on germ-free animals, and they are very healthy for a much longer time than germ-ridden animals.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think this theory that we need our microbiome is institutional stupidity or something more sinister?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think that's a good case for stupidity. For years, I followed the work of several well-known biologists, and for decades I couldn't decide whether they were evil or just stupid. But when they died following their own advice, I decided that they were just stupid.

## 5G and EMF

**Danny Roddy:** What is your take on 5G towers going up? Is it needed for the technocratic slave grid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it makes the control messages faster and more powerful and unavoidable. But at least with that stuff, we can put a screen on the wall between us and the tower, or on the roof and attach it to ground so that we have a Faraday cage around us.

**Danny Roddy:** What do you think of the idea that 5G is causing the symptoms of coronavirus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every little thing hurts. Everything that is stressing you—using up vitamin A and tending to lower your blood sugar—is making you more susceptible and tending towards an inflammatory state. The virus is just one more trigger for the shift to inflammation. But endotoxin from intestinal bacteria is producing exactly the symptoms the virus does. High altitude, brain and lung edema—all of those stressors, when you aren't adapting properly, end up with the same cascade of inflammatory reactions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question about the photoelectric effect. They say 5G is safe because it is non-ionizing radiation. However, the NIH came out with papers saying non-ionizing radiation is clearly carcinogenic. Do you think the higher frequency is worse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of it functions as an antenna. Vitamin A and carotene function as an antenna for blue light. Riboflavin reacts with blue light. The whole idea that only ionization is damaging is part of the membrane theory and the idea that the cytoplasm is just dissolved molecules. If the water is organized and acts as an organizing principle for coherence throughout the cell, then that becomes an antenna for sound frequencies and all the various frequencies of electromagnetic oscillations.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So, the higher the frequency, the more opportunity for molecules in the body to act as an antenna?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The radio waves are the least likely to interact, but when they get down to the wavelength of your brain or your gonad, those wavelengths are especially toxic to those encapsulated organs because the capsule itself captures like an antenna.

## Psychology of the Elite

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think the evil ones driven to harm the world are driven by an internal disturbed psyche, or is there a religious reason?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a lot of it is what Wilhelm Reich explained as the effects of childhood harm coming into the culture. The mothers and fathers both instill a kind of authoritarian stupidity and elitism. The children of the elite get a horrible dose of that kind of destructive authoritarian upbringing.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of your interviews, you said that we have to begin and end with being an animal in this world. I don't know of any animal that behaves in this twisted way. Is that because humans have a wider range of possible behaviors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think it's the exploitive culture taking form through language—how language shapes the way you look at the world and yourself. It closes off things. Right from when people start thinking, they start losing their animal intelligence to the extent that they identify with those authoritarian elements of how the cultures are set up.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So what is the human faculty that allows humans to behave in an intentionally evil way? Is it our higher intelligence?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the big cortex that can be so taken over by language and culture. Culture can be an extension of life and a tool for improving life, but so far cultures have been heavy in the direction of control and reduction rather than expansion.

## The Future

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, in six months when you're forced to buy the new iPhone and show a QR code to buy milk, what are you going to do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Leave, I think.

**Danny Roddy:** Where would you go?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That won't catch on for a long time in small towns in Latin America. There are areas in Mexico where people are just extremely open and humanistic because of the nature of the original culture. They're completely overwhelming the sadistic Spanish-imposed culture.

**Danny Roddy:** What are your thoughts on the future?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think people are reaching a point where they're going to decide they have to choose life and changing the system. If people start interacting and actually realizing that it's a desperate choice that has to be made, intelligence is the nature of life, and I think intelligence will come to the surface in the process. I'm optimistic without having any idea of what's to come.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of his interviews, Dr. Peat said that he would like to see nutrition raised to the respect level of astrophysics. I think that's actually starting to happen right now, mostly by coercion, simply because people will be forced to start taking matters nutritionally into their own hands as the food chain collapses. People start worrying more about nutrition and its quality and less about exactly what kind of car they drive.

**Danny Roddy:** I'll call it there, guys. Thank you so much.
