## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy of DannyRoddy.com and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, and biologist, Raymond Peat. In this episode, we'll talk about the history and origins of authoritarianism and how the philosophy is baked into our cultural, political, and medical systems.

Ray, thank you so much for doing this. I've been interested in this topic for a while. I had a chance to read through your newsletter "Public Passivity and the Screw" from September 2003. I thought it was fantastic.

Authoritarianism seems to be an ambiguous term to a lot of people. Before we get into the weeds, could you talk about what it means to you and your general experience with it, scientifically and academically?

**Ray Peat:** Academically, there has been a study for about 50 years now. Bob Altemeier's book, *The Authoritarians*, came out on the internet maybe five or ten years ago. John Dean, the Watergate lawyer, became a fan of it and helped to publicize it because it was about the psychology of political authoritarianism primarily. His main focus is on what he calls "right-wing authoritarians."

My understanding of it started long before that. It was the intuitive thing of seeing that in the culture, there is an unreasoning submission to the ideas of anyone in power, and conformism around what is taken to be the power-enforced authoritative doctrine.

In reacting to Bob Altemeier's version of it, I have seen that in some ways, publicizing these traits of the right-wing authoritarian might be adding to the confusion somewhat. One of Altemeier's images for how this can be conceptualized comes from Theodor Adorno, a group at Berkeley who made the subject popular in the 1960s. Adorno's image was that it's the posture for riding a bicycle: bowing from the waist up and kicking from the waist down. In other words, submission to the authority of those above you, and knocking down anyone below you to keep them there.

Bob Altemeier says that isn't a very good image. He used questionnaires and got really clear results. But other people using a scale of social prestige-seeking or power-seeking identified people who, rather than conforming and fitting into wherever they find themselves on the scale, are only driven towards rising. You can think of the sociopath or the psychopath who cares about nothing but winning and isn't satisfied until they come out owning everything and controlling everyone.

**Danny Roddy:** Throughout the 20th century, there were different views on fitting into the system.

**Ray Peat:** Yes. Freud said repression is a good thing—fitting into the system. From the time I was in high school, people were saying, "You have to work within the system." My first thoughts on that were imagining that if you cooperate in the system for 10, 20, 30, or 40 years, look at the pile of criminal activities you have participated in. Then, when you finally have the power to do something, the first thing you do puts you out of the system. So you have a huge accumulated pile of bad stuff, and the first chance you have to do good stuff might result in a noticeable achievement, but it's always going to be smaller than what you did in the opposite direction getting there.

I wasn't sold on the idea that you have to work within the system because it's really just a way of buying people into it. Freud really allied with the oppressing class. He created this idea of the ego mediating between the id and the superego. It has to balance these forces, but he really came down on the side of the superego, smashing the id when necessary.

Around 1929 or 1930, Wilhelm Reich realized what Freud was doing. He believed that Freud was very conscious of the rightness of Reich's position—that you're never going to have a healthy individual as long as they're being oppressed—but believed Freud simply wanted to save his movement from Nazism and make it able to survive by giving in to the oppression.

From the 1920s, Reich was saying that there's an emotional plague all through the world. Not just fascism, but the plague of authoritarianism. At first, he said education, medicine, and psychiatry can cure people of this. But then he realized that first, you have to cure the doctors and the teachers of the emotional plague.

I think Reich was essentially right, but I think it is more than just an emotional plague. I think it's something like a historical, intellectual, epistemological plague built into the way we believe knowledge works.

## The Philosophical Roots: Plato vs. Aristotle

**Danny Roddy:** Did it originate from Plato and Aristotle? Do you see an origin for this type of oppressive society?

**Ray Peat:** As soon as I started looking into encyclopedias trying to find explanations, I think it goes even before Plato. Parmenides and Zeno, the Greek school located in southern Italy (the Eleatics), argued that there is only one reality and it doesn't change. It doesn't do anything. There is no movement.

Someone as smart as Bertrand Russell praised the subtlety of Zeno's paradoxes, but Russell struggled for years in what seems like very stupid arguments. However, he was smart enough to work himself out of that set of paradoxical mental activities that Western philosophy had been trapped in for 2,500 years.

Plato essentially gave in to the Parmenides school of thinking that at least the knowledge part of existence—which is the "real" part of existence—is unchanging, eternal, and perfect. He was really making the crude ideas of Parmenides worse.

Aristotle acknowledged some of the reality of Heraclitus. Heraclitus said everything flows—exactly the polar opposite of Plato and Parmenides. Heraclitus said everything is moving, and reason (meaning) steers everything through everything. So it wasn't a jumbled, random movement. It was a developmental process which, as a whole, is steered by meaning.

Aristotle tried to formalize this using some of the concepts of Plato but putting it into a sensible scheme in which he had different kinds of causality, including the final cause principle: that things are moved according to meaning or intention. The universality of motion has no randomness in it. Everything is meaningful.

**Danny Roddy:** That goes back to your newsletter. You say laws were written in the past, and since the past isn't accessible, it's almost as though a foreign power ruled from a distant imperial capital. Is that the problem with not only these laws but politics in general?

**Ray Peat:** Oh yeah. The Platonic idea is creating a false reality for everything that we have in our memory. Seeing everything in terms of the past—something that we have at one time generalized—and then saying that is absolute and unchanging. What it does is say that all of these current events are random happenings. They don't contain the meaning in themselves; they only get the meaning from these generalizations, and those are all eternal, out of time.

This was taken up in physics with the assumption of randomness, which can then be treated statistically. But it's a belief about current events and the nature of substance and experience that is proclaimed to be of a lower order and essentially lacking meaning or purpose.

Plato argued for tyranny, that the people who "know" would have the power, and the power would be logic and mathematics. When this was put into action by the physicists, they proclaimed themselves as those who knew the ultimate fundamental truth. When biology wanted to gain status, they said they would model themselves on the true basic science of physics.

To find the eternal ruling class elements of the world, the physicists looked for timeless, unchanging atoms. The individual atom had no unique features, no history, and was an absolute and pure Platonic thing. The only way they can be treated is by assuming that all of their later developments and movements are meaningless and random and have to be described only statistically.

In modeling biology on physics, the equivalent of the timeless, unchanging atom was the timeless, unchanging gene. Again, the soma—the body that we experience—was said to be basically just mortal junk that would be cast aside every generation, while the immortal germline collection of genes was what was really important. This was developed very closely with people like Herbert Spencer, who identified that even Darwin was a racist that believed that English plants, animals, and people were the best in the world.

## The Dulles Brothers and Political Power

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned psychopaths before, and in a previous interview, you mentioned the Dulles brothers. I think you were alluding to a book by David Talbot called *The Devil's Chessboard*.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, I think that's his name.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned Reich before, and the connection with Dali and the persistence of memory in Dali's shift, integrating himself into the fascist culture. I was curious to unpack your thoughts on the CIA and the Dulles brothers.

**Ray Peat:** Well, 20th-century history pretty much involved the Dulles brothers. They were working with Hitler and the fascist Germans right from the beginning. One of them was declared to be an enemy agent. The German government had put their American properties in his name, so the U.S. government, to confiscate the U.S. properties, identified him as an illegal foreign agent.

But that didn't take away from their prestige or power, because Roosevelt himself was a great admirer of Mussolini. Even after he took office, he was saying what a great statesman Mussolini was. Fascism wasn't a bad word until they needed to go to war on the side of England to save the British Empire because Hitler had double-crossed the West. He wanted to knock out England and take their empire, whereas the West had figured that he would take over the Soviet Union, and then the British Empire and the American Empire could expand.

## Class Warfare and the Illusion of Equality

**Danny Roddy:** Going back to saying the Dulles brothers shaped the current predicament we're in, do you see authoritarianism as a pathology? Like this is basically a sickness, and people are imposing their sickness?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, in a sense. A philosopher might say it's a sickness of method or of conclusions. But if you look at it historically, Parmenides, Plato, and Hegel were all part of the ruling class. It was the purpose of their thinking that way—even though that probably seemed spontaneous and truthful to them—it happened to be a way of defining who deserves power and defining their class as an eternal, justified controller of property and power.

The idea of class was very conscious in most of history. In the 20th century, one of the tricks of the ruling class has been to teach the public that there are no classes in America. I had a professor in graduate school around 1959 or 1960 talking about the effect of class in literature. He interrupted me to say, "In America, we have no classes."

It's truly either a mental disease or defect of some sort for people to grow up, study, and be able to say something like that. It's because the ruling class learned to manipulate language and control the people that they need to be controlled. They don't want to necessarily define them as useless rubbish—which they believe they are—unless they can get away with it. But if they can make the people feel that they are equals with the royalty and keep them happy while they're living like garbage, that's the best thing for them.

So they have taught people that in America there are no classes. People who are really in the bottom 30 or 40% of income call themselves middle class, and people who are more or less in the middle income range think of themselves as being in the upper 5%. Everyone seems to have this escalated delusion of where they are in the social hierarchy.

**Danny Roddy:** It almost seems like any movement is infiltrated by authoritarianism. Is the environment essentially bracketing our current progress as a civilization right now?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, environment in every sense. There are penalties of many sorts for getting out of it, and rewards of various kinds for reinforcing it.

## Environmentalism and Economic Growth

**Danny Roddy:** I first heard about Nicole Foss's ideas of "degrowth" through you. Do you think there will be an inevitable degrowth in our society and a move back to a simpler direction?

**Ray Peat:** No. There will be a rejection or loss of much of the trashy part of our culture, but there is no need to go as far as she suggests—going back to isolated tribalism.

What's creating the "one-worldism" at present is a really degraded concept of human interaction and the interaction between people and their environment. It's all based on this polluted kind of philosophy or religion. It's a religion of emptiness and abstraction that is telling people that this is all there is.

But leaving out all of these promotional, consumerist, economic functions, if you simply stop having wars, stop crooked advertising, and stop promoting consumerism through schools and the way university research is directed and funded—if you simply stop the craziest practices—what will be left will still be international, but without suppressing the individual flavor of ethnicities.

The natural interactions and trade, I think, will keep a unified world economy existing. Even if Foss is right about peak oil—my opinion is that the world is creating petroleum about as fast as it's being used, and it just takes a while to refill the wells after they're pumped out—but even if she was right, there are alternative sources of power that can keep a really high-level culture going more or less permanently.

At present, I think about a dozen species are being made extinct every day. That's an idea of what "progress" means in this current period. If you stop that kind of progress, it's like you stop falling into a hole. As soon as you stop falling, then you can see what kind of possibility is really there.

**Danny Roddy:** So increasing the people's knowledge, ability, and power could restrain the authority of power?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, making people conscious of the lies that they're having imposed on them. That involves things as drastic as saying that most of the theoretical physics that we're taught to admire has been very clever technical adaptations with a gigantic, fraudulent hierarchy of mathematical theories built on that. A little bit of empirical technical stuff has been given a mythic sort of importance because it's used economically and in war. But the implications in theory, I don't think, are at all what we're being told by the theoretical physicists in Europe and America.

## Food Politics and Health

**Danny Roddy:** Obviously you focus a lot on food. Do you think that's a way in to shift the consciousness of the people towards lower serotonin, if that relates to somebody's authoritarianism?

**Ray Peat:** First, a person who is chronically sick and malnourished just doesn't have much energy or stamina to study and be critical. So first, you just have to stop poisoning yourself by eating what the government and dieticians are selling as a healthful diet. Once you have the strength to read and think, then you realize who is doing what to you.

You start investigating the food industry, the agricultural production industry, the science industry that supports the agricultural imposition, and the political system that justifies the medical and agricultural economic imposition. All of these are very clearly wound together in a system to maintain class dominance.

It's very healthful to eat lobster once in a while, but you don't see dieticians or the government recommending that. It started in the 1930s Depression with the government having a three-tiered diet: one to prevent starvation in the very poor, an economical diet to get along on very little, and then at the top, a healthy diet. If you look at the bare survival and economic minimal diet of the Great Depression, the dieticians in the 1960s and 70s adopted those survival diets as the "healthy" diet. Lots of beans and grains as the basic diet.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think that was on purpose, as a form of control?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. Part of it was that the government had been buying milk, dehydrating it, and making cheese and butter to keep American farmers working to support the prices. So they were warehousing huge amounts of powdered milk, cheese, and butter, and giving them away first as foreign aid. The precursor to food stamps was to have a monthly giveaway to poor people of cheese, eggs, powdered milk, and so on.

In the 70s, there was a big movement to stop helping the poor people in other countries as well as the poor at home. One of the arguments that came up in the pseudoscientific dietetic community was that people outside the United States hardly ever can tolerate lactose, so you should stop giving them powdered milk. That argument—that only certain white people can tolerate lactose—was heavily promoted as a racist change of foreign policy against foreign aid and food aid in general. Sending them beans was okay, except we didn't need to support the price of American beans that way.

## The Legacy of WWII and Operation Paperclip

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think this tendency to be authoritarian—or as Altemeier would have said, "right-wing authoritarian"—do you personally see it more in Americans versus other places? I know you've mentioned Mexico as a different type of environment and being a little more cheerful.

**Ray Peat:** A lot of it is the specific policy choices of the government and corporations indoctrinating Americans in a certain way. One of my main criticisms of Bob Altemeier is that he has focused on the right-wing authoritarianism. It would be okay to call it right-wing if you define "right" in the sense of the fascism that Winston Churchill and FDR subscribed to.

Americans generally think of FDR as an extreme leftist president, but definitely his admiration for Mussolini says there was no leftism at all. He said what he was doing was saving his class—saving the ruling class—because there was such a threat of revolution in the United States. So he was saving capitalism, and that would fit in as modified fascism. It was an inventive way of keeping the corporations lightly out of sight, letting them buy the various regulatory agencies, but keeping them out of the executive for their own good.

He was fixing the economy with Keynesian economics. The people who organized a coup in 1933 to get him out considered even the borrowing and spending to be a communist plot of government. They wanted to get Roosevelt out, but what he was doing was using finance to prevent revolution.

Immediately when it came out that Allen Dulles was working closely with the Nazis at the end of World War II, Stalin informed Roosevelt that his spies were aware that Dulles was collaborating with the Nazis. Roosevelt's comments suggested that he thought maybe Stalin had gone crazy to tell him such a thing. But within two or three days, Roosevelt surely would have found out that Stalin was right, and that would have put Dulles in line for the war crimes trials.

Luckily for Dulles, right at that moment, Roosevelt chose to die, saving Dulles from criminal treason prosecution. The powers in the Democratic Party who had connections both with Adolf Hitler and with the DuPont gang that had organized the 1933 coup attempt were in charge of the big city Democratic Party machine. They knew that Harry Truman had expressed himself many times as wanting Hitler to go fight the Soviets. Since that was the preferred American policy, they had installed him as vice president in 1944. So Roosevelt's death in '45 not only saved Dulles, but it put Truman in position to continue the pro-Nazi policy.

We have Project Paperclip, where the top Germans were not only helped to move to Argentina and adjoining countries, but a lot of them were brought to the U.S., the scientists in particular.

**Danny Roddy:** It seems like Dulles was involved in a lot of sketchy stuff like MKUltra. I know you've talked about LSD and its effects on the physiology. Do you see him as an integral part of suppressing that specific substance?

**Ray Peat:** Oh, for sure. One of the people who invented the idea of communist brainwashing said that when prisoners of war had confessed their crimes and wanted to stay with the enemy, it proved that they had amazing powers of brainwashing. I think it was two or three days after a big speech on that, he approved the MKUltra project for testing LSD and other drugs to see if they could wipe out a person's moral restrictions and give complete power over them.

## Reimagining Medicine and Society

**Danny Roddy:** Do you see the disestablishment of medicine as a central tower to turn over to enable the people to resist the authoritarian ideas imposed on us?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. For example, you could still have very strong government control, but if it was rationalized so that a person had to pass a test—had to know certain empirical facts before they could get a license—they would have to know something about blood circulation and how respiration works so that they wouldn't inject things into the wrong part of the patient. With just a reasonable control, you could open up the whole field so that you would have not only more accessible medicine, but also better medicine. It would give people a choice between rational and irrational treatment.

**Danny Roddy:** If you were thinking of an optimal society, would it include medicine or government at all?

**Ray Peat:** Tolstoy and Kropotkin are my oldest political influences. One of Tolstoy's lines was that a person should be ashamed to use government power.

If you have an organization that has simply deleted the threats and the craziness that presently is saturating our culture for maybe five or ten years, I think you would very easily have a powerless society that would function without visible power.

There's a town in Andalusia, Spain, where I think in 1989 they elected an anarchist mayor. It's just an amazing town. They've reelected him ever since. They gradually, piece by piece, expropriated unused land. Within just a very few years of his first election, they had eliminated poverty, eliminated the town police, and had everything cleaned up. That's still going now, 25 or 30 years later. I think that's an example of how any place can work if you just remove the most horrible, oppressive parts of the system.

**Danny Roddy:** We'd probably end there. Ray, thank you so much. That was amazing.

This is actually the end of my stay in San Francisco. I'm going to head to San Miguel de Allende on July 1st. I think Siqueiros is the artist that you enjoy there? I think some of his big stuff is there.

**Ray Peat:** Oh, yeah. I don't think he ever finished a mural in San Miguel. I've always wanted to see that. I heard about the process of starting it and the conflicts that interrupted it.

**Danny Roddy:** Awesome. Yeah, I'll send you a picture. Thank you so much again, Ray. Total pleasure. I appreciate your time.

**Ray Peat:** Okay, great. Thank you.

**Danny Roddy:** Bye, Ray.

**Ray Peat:** Bye.
