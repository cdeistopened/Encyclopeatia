---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Thank you guys for joining us. Raymond Peat, Georgi Dinkov. Ray, how are you? How are things in Eugene, Oregon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good. The usual cold, wet, and dark winter.

**Danny Roddy:** And Georgi, how are things in DC?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Dark, but for different reasons. The political climate is murkier than it was a week ago. We had some snow yesterday, but it's all melted by now. It's just cold and windy, but dry.

## Ray Peat’s Newsletter: Body Temperature, Inflammation, and Aging

**Danny Roddy:** I want to delve into political things, but first I want to tackle Ray's newsletter. Ray, maybe give us an elevator pitch and talk about your newsletter, *Body Temperature, Inflammation and Aging*. I think that would be a great place to start. What was your motivation for writing it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been watching doctors for many years. For example, there was a totally psychotic woman whose brother asked the doctor, "Isn't it significant that her eardrum temperature is only 96 degrees?" The doctor said, "Oh, but that's normal for these people."

About 40 years ago, a woman supposedly with dementia—she couldn't find her way home if she was let out of the house by herself—mentioned that her temperature had been as low as 92 degrees. When she took a little progesterone and got her body warm, she returned to graduate school and got straight A's for a master's degree. Just warming up the brain five or six degrees, you can gain about 60 or 70 IQ points.

When I was working on the physiology of hamster aging, I noticed there were some changes that worked under the influence of either temperature or hormones. Estrogen, which lowers your temperature, happened to cause microtubules to appear. Progesterone, which actually raised the temperature, had the opposite effect on the microtubules.

I started thinking about the effect of cold and hot water. The microtubules are sensitive to the structural temperature of the water—how much order there is in it. There are lots of enzymes in our cells that are structurally sensitive to the temperature of the environment. As the temperature goes down, some enzymes are suddenly totally inactivated while others are activated. It isn't just a chemical reaction; it's a shift in the structure according to the temperature of the water.

There is something about mammals and birds; they function very well if they live at or above 37 degrees Celsius (about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Birds very often like a much higher temperature. Every organism has a specific range where its enzymes work, and the transition can be very sudden.

There is a system that has been more recently discovered called the heat shock proteins. It happens that estrogen receptors are closely tied into the heat shock proteins. What these proteins and estrogen are doing is trying to save the terribly stressed organism that doesn't have the heat to keep working. It does something to lock the structure up and protect it structurally. You can see that in the appearance and disappearance of microtubules and the activity of various enzymes.

That has been in the background of watching people when they take thyroid, or need thyroid, or warm up their brains by taking progesterone or eating more sugar and protein. The national temperature, especially in the last 50 years, has dropped about a degree Fahrenheit for men and somewhat less for young women. For postmenopausal women, their temperature has fallen about as much as men. The fact that young women have a higher body temperature than the average man is an indicator of progesterone ruling their physiology enough to keep them working and avoiding some of the aging diseases that men get, as long as they are cycling and making progesterone.

In this newsletter, I go through all of the things that have been known relating to inflammation, aging, degeneration, and disease as it relates to failing to keep your temperature up where it should be.

## Microtubules and Tissue Hardening

**Danny Roddy:** Silly question, but the microtubules, is that the same thing as the cytoskeleton of the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a big part of it. It's the big hollow ones that are involved in cell division and part of the system of movement. But there are several types of smaller intermediate and smaller filaments.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Wasn't there a recent study showing that pregnenolone is one of the most effective stabilizers of the structure of the microtubules, and cholesterol as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cholesterol, pregnenolone, and progesterone.

**Danny Roddy:** We talked a while ago, Ray, about the hardening and the suppleness of tissue or a cell being a big part of aging and energy. It was really interesting talking about energy having a softening effect and then the deprivation of energy having this hardening effect. That's associated with fibrosis and calcification, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And cancer. There are several articles that are very interesting. For example, once you know that a tumor hardens, these people will say that for telling whether breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, all you have to do is feel for the lymph nodes and see if they're abnormally hardened. If they're not hardened, they're not cancerous.

**Danny Roddy:** And you see estrogen as one of the primary hardening aspects of aging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything that knocks the energy down.

**Danny Roddy:** It's kind of odd that carbon dioxide and the generation of heat have totally been sidelined as the effects of proper mitochondrial respiration. People in the health world are obsessed with mitochondria, but those two things are rarely ever talked about. Is that strange?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very strange. That's part of what organizes my thinking: looking at the reason and the nature of the myths that people have created to support their way of life and their belief system. Mostly the giant corporations that run science and publication.

## The Rate of Living Theory

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ignoring temperature in my newsletter, I talk about the basis that goes back to the idea that Raymond Pearl, a professor at Johns Hopkins, promoted. He said that if you live fast and warm, you'll use up all your heartbeats and burn all your permitted calories and have to die young. He advocated being very lazy and staying cool to live a long time.

**Danny Roddy:** Was he just stupid or was he supported by industry? Is there a specific outcome for the rate of living theory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He was immersed in the matrix of industry, so that was all part of it. But I think he had to be really pretty stupid. You put up a picture of a hummingbird right below his picture, and you can see the difference in vitality and mentality between the two organisms.

**Danny Roddy:** His experiment was on seeds or something? To a layman, it sounds really ridiculous.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once you get used to it, that's not at all unusual. For example, someone was just asking me about the telomere theory of aging and the idea that we have an inborn number of cell divisions. That really derives straight from Pearl's idea that we have only so many heartbeats or so many calories that we can produce in a lifespan. For Hayflick, it was so many cell divisions that were allotted.

The first group of his papers that I read was in 1970. I had to show them around to my friends because I couldn't believe that anyone could really say such stupid things. If you see it in terms of one paper, he kept one group of cells frozen in liquid nitrogen—very cold—for a year or two, and another he kept in the lab in the usual dish. His conclusion was that being frozen at minus 70 degrees Celsius, cells don't age.

**Danny Roddy:** Well, sure. Your orientation was shaped before this by Albert Szent-Györgyi, so you were reading the good stuff. Is that why these ideas seem so ridiculous to you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. But I had started reading the encyclopedias. Even the little Funk and Wagnalls had very good objective articles. Then we got the 1950 Britannica, and some of its articles are still the best on the subject available. The newer 1960s editions have gone somewhat stupid compared to the classics. From 1900 to the 1950s, the Britannica was a great source of orientation in science and culture.

## Evolution, Genetics, and Ideology

**Danny Roddy:** Was Lamarck the counter to this rate of living theory? Was there an idea that was suppressed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It grew most directly out of August Weismann's "wear and tear" theory. The rate of living is just another version of Weismann's wear and tear. Denham Harman's theory of free radical aging—damage to the mitochondria—that's just more wear and tear theory.

Part of the essence of Weismann's ideology was to destroy Lamarck and actual Darwinism to support the essentially idealistic, anti-evolutionary position of the first geneticist, the monk Gregor Mendel. His position was simply derived from Catholic doctrine: that nothing essential changes. Genes are immortal, and so the apparent changes that you see that are mistaken for evolution are just mixing immortal genes. For Weismann, the germline is immortal, and the body, the soma, is mortal. Weismann was just rephrasing the Christian doctrine of Mendel. Those were getting built into the authoritarian side of the medical and biological cultures.

Meanwhile, there was actual science going along at ground level with people like Jacques Loeb, Alexis Carrel, Otto Warburg, and Szent-Györgyi.

**Danny Roddy:** Who were the pro-metabolic people in the '30s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Warburg, obviously, and Frederick Koch. Frederick Koch inspired at least Szent-Györgyi. I don't think Warburg ever said anything about Koch, but his ideas were really kind of vitalistic or holistic. He said the whole organism is the immune system; the vitality of the whole thing isn't separable.

That's what the mainline embryologists were seeing: you can take part of an early embryo and isolate it, and it will produce a whole organism. It's not an assemblage of parts. The ovum has an intention. If you cut the dividing parts of the ovum into several pieces, each one can still fulfill its intention of becoming a whole organism.

That idea continued into field theories of all sorts in the '20s and '30s. People recognizing Warburg's work saw that if you look at an area developing cancer, you can find at the center a perfect malignant bunch of cells. But surrounding that, the next ring of cells will be pre-malignant—very degenerated, but not decisively cancerous, and revertible if you change their embryological position. Surrounding that is less and less inflamed cells. In the '30s, there was lots of evidence showing that cancer is a field process under some degree of control of the surrounding organism.

Gestalt psychology was extending that whole thing, thinking of the brain as similar to the organism, working in terms of wholes, not wires and digital computable units, but as wholes and images. The Second World War distracted from it, but there was a very deliberate killing off of it with several government and industry trends to sell the idea that we are mechanisms and to totally knock out of science history all of this holistic embryological field understanding.

## Telomeres and Cancer

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you had any discussion with proponents of the telomere theory? If telomere length is so important, how come every attempt to inhibit telomerase—the enzyme that preserves length—seems to lead to cancer? There have been at least five or six companies trying to come up with a drug to inhibit that enzyme, and it seems to invariably cause cancer in animal models.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's just one of the organizing things that has to be whole to get a whole functioning organism. You can produce cancer in about a million different ways. I think that's just one of them.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It seems that trying to manipulate the telomere length, or at least artificially keep it long, endangers some kind of cancerous process.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I went through the arguments about 15 or 20 years ago. At that time, there was accumulating evidence that some very old 90- or 100-year-old individuals had long telomeres, and some young people in their 20s and 30s had extremely short, worn-out-looking telomeres. I think the correlation of it strictly with aging has been a biased sampling to fit the ideology.

## Richard Dawkins and Bertrand Russell

**Danny Roddy:** How do you think Richard Dawkins' ideas of the selfish gene grow out of Weismann's? He seems to be the protégé of Weismann living in modern times.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's some kind of growing-up family personality development that happens.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think maternal stress or a rough childhood leads people to develop such a twisted view of nature? He seems to be coming from a fairly well-off family.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. They identify with the interests of the royalty and ruling classes. The ideology is classical, ancient doctrine that the divine right of kings is something built into the universe. Meritocracy derives from the idea of an unchanging, un-evolving social order. Naturally, you can't have monkeys turning into people. If you're going to have divine kings, everything is arranged in a heavenly order—a great chain of being from angels to kings, all the way down to ordinary people and monkeys near the bottom. It's so deeply into our culture. Most professors don't want to acknowledge that that's where our history has come from.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Bertrand Russell seems to have some of those views, but I felt like by reading his works that he eventually realized that the ruling class is just trying to enslave everybody. Do you have a similar impression of him?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Absolutely. He was as high in the ruling class as you can be in England without being royal. He grew up with that perfect, concrete view of logic and mentality. He wanted to show that our divine mentality and clear logic is identical with mathematics.

In middle age, he actually started thinking about it and said, "Well, we really don't know whether Leibniz might have been right, that everything is defined partly by where it is and what it's with." If part of one's being is where one is, then everything is constantly changing its essence. How can you have a perfect mathematical language if reality is actually context-sensitive?

Russell just had that simple insight. How can you define things in isolation? Where do we have the evidence that there are timeless entities, which atoms are believed to be? As he thought more about the Leibnizian possibilities, he realized that there is no evidence basis for having these abstract atomic views of logic. Being very intelligent, he was able to learn and actually think his way out of it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein also had a big impression on him. Wittgenstein asked Russell to write the foreword to his magnum opus, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*. Russell wrote it, and Wittgenstein absolutely hated it and said, "You think like a computer. This is not what this book is all about." Russell was devastated because he thought Wittgenstein was brilliant. He said that was the event that made him turn to politics and social moral philosophy.

## CO2 Therapy and Mental Health

**Georgi Dinkov:** I saw several studies performed in the '70s in the United States giving people either vitamin B1 or acetazolamide, or the two together, and also warming people up. They were able to permanently cure severe psychiatric diseases that are nowadays considered incurable. How is it possible that human trials like this could occur in the '70s, but these things cannot seem to happen now? If you try to convince a funding body to give you money for vitamin B1 or acetazolamide, they will laugh you out of the room.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before that, some psychiatrists put patients in a house with continuously elevated carbon dioxide, and all of their psychopathic conditions improved. What that elevated CO2 does is increase your metabolic rate and body temperature. So there have been lots of workable therapies, but no one sells those things. You can't make a trillion dollars selling thiamine or carbon dioxide.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is this basically due to the fact that the pharma industry really took full control of academia over the last two or three decades?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. It's a continuing process. They're trying to finish it off now. They're trying to get the nuisance students and professors out of the universities and turn it over to one or two corporations who will prepare the courses and sell the licenses.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Doesn't this new model move us further away from experimentation towards abstract thinking? I have friends with graduate degrees in chemistry, and it seems to move entirely towards so-called "in silico" modeling—using computer models to design new molecules.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it will rarely cause embarrassment for anyone. The computers aren't going to invent anything shockingly unexpected, but experiments actually are constantly doing that.

## Metabolism, ROS, and PUFA

**Danny Roddy:** Can we talk about "living fast, dying young" and the temperature in relation to ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) and aging? I still see people talking about how increasing metabolism increases ROS.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ability to detoxify the free radicals increases when your metabolic rate is higher. Slowing your metabolic rate shifts you towards the reductive, anti-oxidative state, and you grossly slow down your ability to inactivate the free radicals that are produced.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding calorie restriction models, you pointed out in your *Generative Energy* book that that could be from a multitude of different things, from PUFA restriction to heavy metal restriction. People online talk about longevity and aging like they're the same thing, but they're not, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. You can avoid the main things that kill old people and extend lifespan up to 90 or 100, and that's what the genetic determinists emphasize. They say the process is essentially mechanical.

But experiments show that animals with more saturated fat live at a higher temperature without damage and live much longer than animals of a similar weight with highly unsaturated membranes. The hotter you are, the more you revise your fats away from unsaturation.

If you grow soybeans in a hot, humid climate, they'll have more saturated fats than in a northern climate. If you have a pig in the north eating the usual corn and beans diet, it's going to have very unsaturated fat in the layer close to its skin because the skin is living at a lower temperature. But if you put a sweater on the pig so its skin doesn't get so chilled, its subcutaneous fat will be much more saturated. We adjust to keep the hot tissues from getting over-unsaturated. The breakdown of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in the mitochondria turns down the oxidation energy production and lets only the random kind of oxidative damage occur.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Aren't the polyunsaturated fats also deactivating the uncoupling enzymes, the ones that raise temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in general, the life-extending things do increase the uncoupling activity.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've also seen several studies showing that lower temperature increases the activity of the enzyme aromatase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, a Russian experimenter noticed that testicles and ovaries live considerably cooler than the core temperature of the body. That's surprising in the case of ovaries because they're in the core, but they have a cooling system. He chopped up bits of ovaries and implanted them under the ear skin of rabbits. Their long ears in a cool climate are several degrees cooler than the rest of the body. He found that they went into constant estrus. They were overproducing estrogen basically.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is the adaptive function of the chronic inflammation that seems to be happening under constant exposure to low temperature? Is it a desperate attempt to raise temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think I understand why it happens. The proper response to injury doesn't involve inflammation, so I think those are being used in a way that they weren't intended by the organism. I think they function in a healthy environment—with the right oxygen tension and so on—as regulators and don't really turn on that anti-biological kind of inflammation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If an organism's stores of fat were 100% saturated, when exposed to cold, there wouldn't necessarily be an inflammatory response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think that's part of why injured fetuses inside the womb don't heal by forming a scar. They heal perfectly. A damaged part of a fetus can regenerate itself without forming a scar. I think that's because of the high, steady temperature, carbon dioxide, and glucose meeting the needs, so that those very same peptides that cause inflammation in the worst situation are constructive and reparative.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), do they have any positive function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Locally produced, yeah. Monoamine oxidase, I think that's the enzyme in the lungs and a few other places that destroys serotonin.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The medical industry says ROS tend to accumulate when there's a blockage of metabolism. A recent study showed that administering chemicals that block the electron transport chain drastically increased the production of ROS. So it's low metabolism that causes ROS, not high.

## Thyroid, Magnesium, and Hibernation

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned Broda Barnes in your newsletter. Was he the inspiration for the first time you took thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** His books came out in the early 1970s. I had been thinking about it for years, but since I had a much above-normal metabolic rate, I had to learn other things before I was willing to experiment with thyroid.

I was on a BMR machine where you breathe oxygen while lying at rest. During the test, I had used up the oxygen before the test was over. It looked from the slope of the line like it was about three times the normal rate. I was aware of that for nine or ten years before I finally convinced myself to try taking thyroid. When I did, within a few days, my rate of metabolism had come down to approximately normal.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think your high natural rate of metabolism was from stress, and taking the thyroid lowered it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since then, I've known a few men in their 20s to early 40s with a similar thing. They would weigh maybe 140 pounds. No matter how much they ate, they couldn't gain any weight. From my own experience, I suggested they try thyroid, and every one of them immediately started building muscle and growing.

My interpretation came after I read Jerry Aikawa's book on magnesium. Magnesium is held inside the cells largely as a complex with ATP. When you have more ADP (the de-energized form), that associates with calcium. As your energy level goes down, your cells pick up calcium and lose magnesium. If you lose magnesium, you get cramping and inability to relax fully. The cell sits there spending energy just making ATP so that it can hang on to magnesium, which tends to get lost.

Supplementing magnesium to a hypothyroid person will typically relieve their symptoms for a very short time. If you measure it, they've lost all the magnesium you put in them a few hours later. If you give them quick-acting T3 and magnesium, they haven't lost their magnesium. It's like a switch letting your cells retain the magnesium.

**Danny Roddy:** When you first took thyroid, did that accompany a resolution of symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. When I lectured, someone asked why I wasn't fidgeting the way I always did before. And I slept much more easily without being wakened by any little environmental noise. I was going into a deeper sleep.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The BMR machine measures oxygen consumption, but it doesn't measure carbon dioxide production. In order to find out if your basal metabolic rate is high in a good way, you also have to measure how much carbon dioxide you expire, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what matters: the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of oxygen consumed. It should be very close to the same.

**Danny Roddy:** Maybe we could touch on PUFA and hibernation. Are you familiar with Chris Knobbe? He's talking about cardiolipin and cytochrome C oxidase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nope, I haven't heard of him.

**Danny Roddy:** Just the general biological view of PUFA and hibernation. I read articles by Geiser that align with what you're talking about.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They've known for a long time that animals eat unsaturated fats in the fall when the nuts are ready. Their bodies become much more polyunsaturated, and then they go into a torpor. The typical hibernator who gets very torpid and cold usually has to wake up two or three times from the torpor to go to sleep, because they actually need real sleep for brain maintenance and repair. When we go into hibernation, we just get a cold brain and get sick. Deep sleep needs a good warm temperature.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think there were a few studies recently showing that hibernating animals refuse to eat nuts and seeds if they're given during the hot months. They only eat them when they're about to go into torpor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're very sensible.

## COVID-19, Vaccines, and The Great Reset

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, are you surprised at the lack of coordination between the messaging behind the vaccine? It seems so incoherent.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This is assuming that there is something sensible going on. If you pay close attention to the experts, especially the government-connected experts, I haven't seen anyone who is both informed and honest. Everything they describe as a new, uniquely bad disease was an outstanding feature of influenza.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think it's being rushed so quickly that it scares people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We should hope that it's going to scare a lot of people. Did you read the Pfizer publication? The chief editor of the *New England Journal of Medicine*, Eric Rubin, wrote an editorial saying what a triumph this information is. He was on the FDA committee that voted for it, and his magazine gets huge amounts of advertising from Pfizer.

Pfizer didn't say a peep about who was excluded from the tests. But when two English nurses developed anaphylaxis, Pfizer said, "Well, allergy was one of the groups that was excluded from testing." They also excluded old people. But the first people who are going to get the actual vaccine are the people in long-term care homes—the frail and old—exactly the people that vaccines usually don't work very well with.

Eric Rubin said on a radio interview he was glad that his young, healthy patients weren't in line to receive the vaccine now, so that they would be able to see what its effects are on frail old people.

**Danny Roddy:** Dr. Kelly Moore says don't be surprised when older people are dying within a day or two of their vaccination.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When it came out that they had excluded allergic people, an official at the FDA said there are 1.6 million allergic people in the US who might suffer anaphylaxis. He said, "1.6 million is a lot of people. We can't afford not to vaccinate that large number of people." So naturally, they will be required to risk anaphylaxis.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There was also the issue of the trial design. They use the PCR test to determine trial participants, which has a high false negative rate. There is no guarantee that the people admitted to the trial didn't already have COVID and natural immunity. And I think they didn't control for prior vaccinations. It was a very poorly designed trial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think someone at Pfizer said the experimental period goes on for two years, so we won't know how safe it is until then.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But the emergency use authorization basically says the FDA is not saying this is safe or effective; it leaves it as a decision between a doctor and a patient. But that's not what we're hearing on TV.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The insiders talk somewhat sensibly to each other about actual dangers, but the very same person talking on television tells a totally different story. Clearly, they're crooks and careless about public health.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are there any publications demonstrating incorporation of mRNA material into our DNA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For years, Walter Doerfler in Germany has been demonstrating the incorporation of foreign DNA just from regular exposures. Now we have the intramuscular injection. Once it's in the cell, we have reverse transcriptase enzymes that can turn viral RNA into DNA, which can then be integrated into our genome.

**Danny Roddy:** I was going to ask about fertility and syncytin. You said previously that we're being prepared to activate our renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is the opposite of progesterone. This would be an anti-fertility vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's one personality of the spike protein and the syncytial protein that forms the placenta—they're structurally very similar. Until that's disposed of, I don't know why anyone shouldn't just stop until they do some actual experiments.

**Danny Roddy:** That could be on purpose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. When you see the horrible things they do openly, then I don't know why you should suppose they wouldn't do the ordinary conspiratorial kind of anti-human activities.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You said several times that when we're exposed to chronic stress, retroviral material in our genome starts to shed into the bloodstream. Since this vaccine has this highly pro-inflammatory protein, do you think there's a risk of causing an AIDS-type syndrome?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just from dumping lots of new, unfamiliar stuff. The more of it that comes out at once, the more confusion it can cause in your metabolism and immune reactions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Outside of the COVID-19 vaccine, are there any other mRNA vaccines in widespread use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. But things like the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) tumor producer—they knew it was there when all the world-famous vaccine people were talking. One of them said, "Oh, well, good. The Russians are using it now. Maybe it'll get rid of some Russians."

**Danny Roddy:** When do you think the proverbial crap hits the fan?

**Georgi Dinkov:** That's going to happen in April when they do this mass vaccination campaign.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm hoping that there will be a big reaction against it. Putting nurses and doctors in the front line as expendables... remembering what Eric Schmidt and Klaus Schwab have been predicting: we aren't going to need doctors or teachers anymore. So they're good experimental material for a first run of the virus because we're going to have digital medicine along with digital education.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you think of anything in history as crazy as this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think this tops the list.

**Danny Roddy:** Even World War II?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The Korean War was really a highlight of how they could be committing genocide, destroying more of a single country than they've ever destroyed before. Practicing biological warfare and bombing every city until there was nothing. Even Douglas MacArthur vomited when he saw what they had done.

**Danny Roddy:** When do you think the powers that be realized that crisis serves them very well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think organized efforts were in the various foundations long before that. The Rockefeller Foundation had people working on it.

## Technology, Cybernetics, and Society

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski? Have you read his manifesto?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I kind of liked it. Nice environmental sentiment.

**Georgi Dinkov:** He seemed to condemn technocracy. Do you think he got those ideas while he was tortured at Harvard under MKUltra?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know anything on the inside of that. But it was too bad he had the publicity that he did because anyone looking at the inside of things should come up with conclusions like that—that technology is a dead end as it's going.

Norbert Wiener was warning of that in the early '50s. He refused grants related to mass murder and was ridiculed at MIT. But his *The Human Use of Human Beings* was a very interesting book. He saw the divide between digital control and analog control. You're much less likely to go off into insane futures if you are thinking in terms of analogs, where the whole process becomes invisible when it's digital.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there's an optimal level of technological development?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Somewhere very close to the middle of the 20th century, we had everything a person could conceivably need. It was the computer world and the CIA getting together around the 1940s and '50s that put it on the death path.

**Danny Roddy:** What is your take on Bitcoin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't really know what it is. It's what the Federal Reserve will turn our regular money into in the near future. I know something bad like that will happen, but I don't care to understand it.

**Danny Roddy:** Klaus Schwab saying there's going to be a giant cyber attack that brings down power and internet—that seems like a convenient way to censor everyone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's pretty much on schedule, I think.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If all currency derives its value from the people, and the elite is waging war against humanity, isn't that undermining their own wealth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they figure they're going to integrate China and get everyone just as thoroughly controlled as the American population.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So in a strange way, China is like an obstacle in their course?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. China has the vitality of lots of intelligent, well-educated people developing economic power. I don't think it's going to be very easy to eliminate them from their program.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think Russia has already been subjugated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As long as Putin is in, I think they have such a literate population that that will give them momentum for a couple of generations. Just people who read, who really think about politics rather than just consuming it.

## Copper and Pigmentation

**Danny Roddy:** Copper is being talked about a lot. You've said chronic loss of copper accounts for features of aging, and that thyroid is needed to absorb copper. Is there a narrative there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a book by A.E. Needham on the nature of the materials involved in organisms. It's a portrait of all the biological elements. I think you should try to get a personal feeling about what its properties are.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there an internal metabolite that copper associates with, similar to how magnesium associates with ATP?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nothing occurs to me. It's in competition with iron and molybdenum and cooperates closely with zinc. It's a polar pair with selenium.

**Danny Roddy:** Copper is retained in proportion to the protein ceruloplasmin. What increases that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress and estrogen increase it. So you don't want too much of it. Any heavy metal in excess will cause you to overproduce metallothionein, which will fairly indiscriminately deplete your tissues of heavy metals.

**Danny Roddy:** Is copper absorbed in relation to the activity of cytochrome C oxidase? Therefore, if a person is low thyroid, they're not going to retain much copper?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's true. The same way thyroid pulls magnesium into cells by creating its mate, I think modifying the cell structure is what pulls and retains copper.

**Danny Roddy:** How would one gauge their copper needs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good oxidative function. Definite evidence that something's going wrong with your copper is if you're losing pigment in hair or skin.

## Lidocaine and Eugenol

**Danny Roddy:** Lidocaine. You mentioned it prevents mast cell degranulation, is nerve-protective, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer. What is so useful about lidocaine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has analgesic effects and anti-tumor/anti-inflammatory effects. Basically, anything which is anti-inflammatory should be checked out. It turns out that it is safe in those amounts. You don't want to use the anesthetic high concentration of 2%—that will kill everything it touches. But a periodic systemic dose of 50 or 100 milligrams is probably therapeutic for cancer, arthritis, and degenerative things.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In doctors' offices, if somebody cannot be treated with lidocaine, they use a substitute called eugenol. It seems to have many of the same effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, eugenol is very pleasant smelling. You can make fillings out of it too. Mix it with zinc oxide and make a non-toxic filling.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think a similar dosage range, like 50 to 100 milligrams, would be safe systemically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It would be safe to experiment with.

## Starch, Citric Acid, and Vitamin K

**Danny Roddy:** Getting rid of citric acid in canned fruits. Is there a way to mitigate the harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think so. Citric acid is made in the citric acid cycle, so people think of it as harmless, but everything should be in the right place. Coming in from outside the cell isn't really a safe thing. There are suspicions that it might be carcinogenic to constantly consume a large amount of it.

**Danny Roddy:** What function is starch having in the low thyroid person? It's common to hear people say they can't give it up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just probably as a guilt-free way of eating sugar. Sugar or starch can make you feel really good because it lowers stress. But the thyroid regulates your blood sugar, so you're more likely to think of ham and eggs rather than potatoes and toast.

**Danny Roddy:** What are the giant doses of vitamin K doing that the lower doses wouldn't do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's working as an extension or amplifier of coenzyme Q10. It associates with that and helps feed energy into the mitochondria.

**Danny Roddy:** Would larger doses be useful for any degenerative health problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Russians tested it on both cancer and brain problems. I've known people—one guy had blood pressure of 240 over 70. He took one or two droppers full, probably more than 50 drops per day, and in just a few days his pressure was down to 140 over 70 and stayed there.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I just started today thinking that I will pull out some more ideas from the temperature thing—the connection between heat shock proteins, estrogen receptor, and the process of disorder and reestablishing order.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you let everybody know how to obtain your newsletter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I just wanted to mention that vitamin K tends to be strongly anti-estrogenic in higher doses. It increases the conversion of cholesterol into all of the downstream steroids. Studies show that very old rats, when given the equivalent of the human dose of about 100 milligrams, immediately get the testosterone of younger rats. Another recent study found that vitamin K is also an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B).

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, thank you so much. It's always special having you on the show. Georgi, thank you for being with us. Have a safe weekend, everybody. We'll talk to you guys soon. Goodbye.
