## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** We're live. Thank you guys so much for bearing with us, we had slight technical difficulties. Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov, this is our third episode. Thank you guys so much for joining me. Ray, these episodes are really special, so I sincerely appreciate you joining us. How are you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pretty good.

**Danny Roddy:** We were just chatting before we went live about global warming, or so-called climate change. That might be an interesting place to start in talking about the intersection between coronavirus, the elite, global climate, and quotes from the Club of Rome talking about how we needed to find a common enemy to unite humanity, and that the real enemy was man itself.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, China is just a convenient propaganda object to justify things. For example, they say they'll be testing new, more usable atomic bombs within a few months. But that's been the very long-term plan of the Pentagon: justifying the invention of planetary warming through carbon dioxide. They have to change the economy away from carbon energy to nuclear energy so they can have a constant supply of nuclear fuel to make bombs. It is simply a way to focus the attention of the world. As long as they have nuclear bombs that are more and more usable, they experience the sense of power that's recognized by everyone.

China is just the momentary focus of why they need the bombs. But after China is no longer a threat or rules the world, they'll still have to hang on to their nuclear bombs just for their police power, even if it's only within this continent. They'll still have their nuclear deterrent.

## Geopolitics: The US, China, and Russia

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you see this ending in a terrible way, like a war between the US and China?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Russia and China are now getting close militarily as well as economically. So basically, the US is lost on that basis. They wouldn't have a chance in a nuclear war. Putin told them that Russia won't allow another war to be fought on their territory. They've had three great wars that ruined the country each time. He said it won't happen again. They have demonstrated their weapons that can eliminate the source of any invasion, either topically or systemically.

**Danny Roddy:** Some people in the conspiracy sector think there's uniformity among these big empires. Are they trying to do the same thing, or are they radically opposed to each other?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things that China has done are really similar to what the US is doing right now in terms of controlling the citizenry.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are they just in a race to see how fast they can get more control over the population?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The US isn't very sympathetic with their concept. China is very focused on public health and education, whereas the US is always behind on public consciousness and education supported by good health. They're doing things that have massively ruined the public's health, which drags down the way they perform intellectually and productively. They see that if things continue with a more or less even playing field, China is obviously imminently winning the game. So, they're trying to change the rules fast enough that they can get ahead. Eric Schmidt gave a very detailed discussion of how artificial intelligence is to be used to preempt China's digitalization of the economy of the world.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why would the United States be stupidly destroying its own population, considering that they need that population to be as productive and healthy as possible? Even if it's done without good intentions—just to make sure the "slaves" are healthy, so to speak. It seems like the opposite is happening; the population is being decimated educationally and nutritionally. How does that help the empire? Or is the empire basically saying, "We don't care about the population, we're just going to neutralize any competitive threat"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That concept of automation and artificial intelligence has been such a deep part of them since the 1930s. Since then, they have considered public education as a drag on the system—a waste of resources. It was just a little over 50 years ago that it became a very open public policy that they were set on "peonizing" the whole United States, taking policy choices that would reduce income growth for nearly everyone while concentrating it. Reaganism was simply one stage of this process in peonization.

**Georgi Dinkov:** With all this military power and technology, if the empire really wanted to out-compete everybody else, why can't they just colonize the moon or Mars? There's an infinite universe out there. Instead, the efforts are focused here on attacking other people who are raising their heads.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thought of having a world of peons is such an emotional part of it. The ruling class hates the idea of competition from ordinary people. So, choices were made way back to degrade as many people as possible by lowering the quality of schooling and nutrition. They started that in the '30s. In Los Angeles, I saw doctors trained to recommend grains, pasta, and beans as the "economy diet," and seafood, fruit, and dairy foods for the "privileged diet."

**Georgi Dinkov:** So would it be fair to say that a psychopath is always seeking out conflict with other people? They're saying, "No, there's no people on Mars to enslave, so we're going to focus our efforts here on Earth because there are other people we can torment."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nelson Rockefeller and Franklin Roosevelt had agreed on the post-war world. They were to develop Latin America first as part of our economic system, building them up as a consumer economy, and then Africa and Asia would come at later stages. A "Marshall Plan for the world" was the idea—to get the whole world up to speed so that capitalism could continue as a growing, productive system. But the faction that took over with Truman—the Dulles faction—they were the elite haters of the public.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you heard the rumor that FDR was murdered?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. The Roosevelt family was convinced of it, Stalin was convinced of it. Anyone who knew what Allen Dulles had been doing during the war knew it was treason. It came out that Stalin's spies told Roosevelt what Dulles had been doing—working for the Nazi army—and Roosevelt said, "Oh, that isn't possible, that would be treason." It took a couple of weeks for the facts to come through because it was held up by the German/Dulles intelligence apparatus. By the time it reached the United States, Roosevelt had died.

## The Drug War and Intelligence Agencies

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, do you think the different power elite factions are on the same page about installing killer austerity? For example, Webster Tarpley writes that Soros is associated with projects designed to assault traditional moral values, such as championing legalized narcotics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CIA financing itself by selling drugs in the big cities in the US has been documented over and over. They were profiting in two ways: by destroying poor people in the US and financing their illegal operations with drug money.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What was the name of the journalist that wrote about the crack epidemic being started by the CIA, who was found with two bullet holes in his head and it was ruled a suicide? Gary Webb?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, sort of hard to shoot yourself twice in the head.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Did you hear about the death of China's ambassador to Israel?

**Danny Roddy:** No.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of weeks ago. China has been making big deals in technology with Israel. Pompeo visited Netanyahu trying to get him to stop the deals with China. Suddenly, China's ambassador, who had been the agent for building infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, died in his sleep at the age of 57, just about a month after taking office.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It reminds me of the Iranian nuclear scientists who started mysteriously dying all over the world. They found out it was Mossad agents using fake British passports.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This assassination really implies that the US is inside the Mossad because it was absolutely against Israel's interests.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've heard the opposite, that Mossad has infiltrated the CIA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably both. They're the same agency.

## Zionism

**Danny Roddy:** There was a comment online claiming you've never criticized Israel before. What is your general take on that situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1976, it seemed like most of my friends were Jews, but suddenly the attitude changed. They were starting to confound Zionism with Jewishness. If you criticized Zionism, which I was doing constantly, they were calling you anti-Semitic. From the mid-70s, my criticism of Zionism has been very steady.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you say what Zionism is and why you disagree with it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you know about the Protocols of the Elders of Zion? Those principles are being freshly stated over and over again. It was an idea current at the end of the 19th century. After Israel was founded, leading rabbis there have repeatedly restated exactly what they have in mind—definitely not staying within the borders the UN, British Empire, and United States gave them.

**Danny Roddy:** You've been somewhat pro-Trump in recent discussions. Some argue he is in the pocket of Israel. How do you unpack that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The important thing is that from Truman down through Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, and Hillary Clinton, the main thrust of US intention was the destruction of Russia first, and then China second. Trump was an interruption of that long, almost 70-year pattern. He definitely is not against the ruling class, just different factions within it. But I think the avoidance of nuclear annihilation, at least for a few years, has been a great achievement.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the Rockefellers and their eugenics/austerity plan is different from the Rothschilds' Zionist plan? Or are they compatible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they're compatible. Either way, almost everyone ends up as disposable property.

**Georgi Dinkov:** At what point do you think the old school, white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant powers merged with the Zionist powers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they seem merged at this point. Rupert Murdoch being an agent of the Rothschilds and buying up all the media was key in controlling the opinions and thoughts of people. The New York Times is in harmony with Murdoch's media.

## Social Engineering and "The Strategy of Tension"

**Danny Roddy:** You once wrote to a listener, "The reason I talk more about biology than politics is that various radical movements generally have inflexibilities that keep them apart." This makes me think of our current situation—coronavirus dying down, then immediately the death in Minnesota [George Floyd]. Is this a conditioning thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Accidents and stupid murders will be taken advantage of to excite racial hostility. I think there are enough accidental racist events happening that it's just a matter of how the media presents them. They make it a matter of racial identity primarily, postponing actual changes like fixing police forces.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Isn't it dangerous for the rich to play that game? One of these days, a racial incident could lead to a revolution where everything gets destroyed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have atom bombs backing them up. They've used Israel to train the police in military tactics. If that fails to hold down a revolution, they have tactical nuclear weapons that can be used for crowd control.

**Georgi Dinkov:** That's the Samson Option?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Samson Option is Israel's plan. Basically, if Israel is about to disappear, they'll make sure the world disappears as well. In the background, for most of the Cold War, the US had a doomsday system—a nuclear bomb surrounded by tons of plutonium to create a radiation cloud that would end the world. People like Buckley made the explicit argument that people should prefer to die rather than let the Soviet Union govern. "Better dead than red."

**Danny Roddy:** People don't believe how bad their government intelligence agencies could be. We've talked about Project Northwoods and Operation Gladio. One operative said the goal was to attack civilians to force the public to turn to the state for security.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I doubt most Americans have paid attention to the news that Syrian wheat crops are being firebombed by US helicopters. It's a crime against humanity.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think if evil triumphs, it will eventually collapse because it's against physical laws? Or will it last indefinitely?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They always need abject obedience in sufficient quantity to have servants and assassins. At some point that dwindles. Their use of power is mainly to increase power. Just the concentration of wealth means pretty soon Amazon owns everything and everyone else is expendable. Then the board of directors starts fighting for who has the most power.

## Vaccines, Aluminum, and Brain Health

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you wrote in an email: "No, a person is never again the same after reacting to an aluminum adjuvant. The official figures of the US government show clearly that the epidemic of chronic diseases began with the massive increase of vaccination in 1989." Can you offer more context?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The size of a baby's brain, especially in relation to its body length at birth, had been growing from the early 20th century steadily down to the 1970s. In some countries in the 1980s, it began shrinking. I think that's a pretty good worldwide indicator of the state of well-being and deterioration.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the Flynn effect, where IQ increased until the mid-70s and has been in decline since? Also, sperm counts and testosterone levels have been declining since the 70s.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Brain size, IQ, and probably several other indicators of general well-being have all stopped increasing and begun declining.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there something specifically harmful about the aluminum adjuvant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything you do, you're always in process. Heraclitus didn't miss anything; nothing is ever constant. But some things shift the trajectory more seriously and downward. Radiation and stuff injected into your muscles or brain are especially harmful. Inhaled or swallowed nanoparticles go everywhere in the body. They are sitting there ready to make genes out of the RNA, ready to translate it into DNA.

Regarding the new vaccines, this DNA can be incorporated into our genes so that our offspring will continue making that spike protein. If we don't make enough of it to kill the person within the year, the incorporation of RNA will undoubtedly have effects that are going to be at least somewhat harmful, maybe progressively harmful.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In terms of transgenerational effects, which generation would have it worst?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on what the individual confronts in each generation. Around half of our DNA specifies retroviruses. When we're under stress, these are expressed. When we are well-fed and happy, we can take in something like the spike protein RNA and pack it away. But anything that creates a great problem causes our system to open up this vast library of genetic material. Adding one bit to it might not come out for 20 generations, but it's still idiotic to put the most toxic protein—the spike protein—into our library of resources.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Speaking of messing with DNA, do you think GMO crops could have transgenerational effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh sure. Everything has a transgenerational effect.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the Epicyte gene that Monsanto patented? It's an artificially created gene for corn that specifically makes human males sterile.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything in a vaccine is practically adequate to create allergies in a young person. If you include the nucleic acid, as this new vaccine is doing—or even the old vaccines which have nucleic acids from the culture medium (egg, animal tissue)—those are among the things making people allergic. Now that they're acknowledging they're putting a nucleic acid in everyone, the recipient is going to have to be labeled a "genetically modified organism."

## Protection Against Vaccine Injury

**Georgi Dinkov:** Most adjuvants target the endotoxin receptor (TLR4). Would blocking that receptor before getting a vaccine confer some protection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything anti-inflammatory that you do is going to tend to inhibit that. Everything you do that is stressful is going to sensitize it. The real disease of coronavirus is just a very standardized stress disease. That's why it overlaps so perfectly with sepsis, high altitude pulmonary edema, or ARDS caused by trauma.

There have been studies showing that people vaccinated against influenza had somewhat fewer cases of influenza, but were as much as five or six times as likely to have other respiratory infections.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So in principle, taking a hefty dose of aspirin about an hour before a forced vaccine would be a decent attempt to protect yourself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, very good. Angiotensin activates prostaglandins. If you stop the prostaglandin storm, you reduce the cytokine storm. Angiotensin receptor blockers also stop the inflammatory storm at its source.

In Italy, mortality for men was much higher than women. The only premenopausal women who died had radically abnormal hormonal problems. Estrogen increases angiotensin, and angiotensin activates aromatase. Women supplementing estrogen, especially after menopause, are at risk. The other big natural difference is altitude. Mortality is lower at high altitude where progesterone increases adaptively. When you adapt to altitude, you keep your carbon dioxide very high, which goes with allopregnanolone and progesterone metabolites being elevated.

## Sexuality and Culture

**Danny Roddy:** I was reading a James W. Prescott article, "Body Pleasure and the Origins of Violence." He says the greatest threat comes from nations that are most repressive of sexual affection. But we also see the sexualization of culture being used as a weapon. Where is the healthy middle ground?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Prescott was a Reichian. I would agree with Wilhelm Reich that "sexual freedom" has been a fraud and a distortion of sexuality rather than a liberation. The weirdness has been amplified. The CIA, with Gloria Steinem for example, created a new view of feminism—industrial-grade power feminism—rather than erotic free feminism.

**Danny Roddy:** You wrote that high estrogen sometimes causes insatiable sexual interest, partly by increasing adrenal androgens and partly by inhibiting satisfying orgasms. Can you clarify?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Wilhelm Reich called it "genitalization"—the localization of the orgasm and losing the whole organism's function of the orgasm. He saw the real orgasm as a cosmic thing where your whole view of your partner and the universe undergoes a change. The orgasm is a discovery rather than a sneeze in the loins.

**Danny Roddy:** What do you make of sexual obsession, porn addiction, and the movements like NoFap?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think a good place to start would be to read some of Wilhelm Reich's writings. He saw it as a very important political question.

**Danny Roddy:** Is the attraction to masturbation/porn a low-energy activity, something exciting to do when you're in a low-energy state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh sure. It can be relaxing and break stress. Little kids often do it just to go to sleep.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So abstaining from one of the few things that brings relief can itself be pathological?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The obsessive trying to change your behavior is part of an obsessive attitude. Just preserving that little private corner can save a person from whatever monstrous situation they're in.

**Danny Roddy:** Part of the function of estrogen, if it relates to insatiable interest in sex, is that a signal that the environment is bad and the organism should reproduce as fast as possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The worse the situation is, like a drought, grass will rush to produce a seed. Early puberty in girls occurs in extremely stressed societies. In traditional, calm, well-fed societies, puberty would normally be around 17 or 18.

## Finasteride and Hair Loss

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding finasteride, you wrote: "I think it probably started a chronic malfunction of your liver and intestine." Can we flush out the details?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, no one *has* to take it. It's an irrational decision and probably means you're already abjectly obedient to authority. It's a very powerful intervention in your steroid chemistry, especially affecting your brain. To get over it, you're going to have to push the system artificially in the opposite direction.

**Danny Roddy:** When it does regrow hair, what is it doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Somehow shaking up the system, like creating an early false puberty. You can bring some parts of the system into function in isolation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There was a study showing that if you give snails a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (like finasteride), they no longer coil. It completely disrupts their morphogenetic field.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and all the stabilizing steroids are essential to holding our organism in its shape and determining its future shape—the way it coils and uncoils.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Apparently the 5-alpha reductase enzyme is important for the synthesis of bile acids. If you inhibit it, you won't produce bile acids crucial for digestion.

**Danny Roddy:** There is a huge culture around "post-finasteride syndrome" looking for a cure. What is your thought?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to back up and radically redo your life. Go to high altitude for six weeks, eat a totally different diet, make sure calcium intake is high compared to phosphate. Phosphate excess activates parathyroid hormone (PTH), aldosterone, and angiotensin—everything that destroys hair growth. High energy is needed to renew the follicle.

**Danny Roddy:** Is a balding scalp proportionally colder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's because it's quiet relative to the other parts of the brain. You can't think and plan if your frontal lobes are cool. It has to be cooler than the rest of your brain and body. Progesterone helps maintain that coolness by keeping the activity focused rather than attending in the direction of excitotoxicity.

**Danny Roddy:** So balding could be viewed as a brain excitotoxicity problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You're not keeping the back part of your brain differentiated adequately from the front. If you raise your whole energy production, that whole syndrome (earlobe crease, high cholesterol) almost always goes with chronic low temperature.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Since estrogen decreases core temperature, would blocking estrogen be a right approach for restoring hair?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The function of estrogen is to block a cell from going into that quiescent state, forcing it to act immediately and intensely. You have to turn off that glycolytic metabolism and go to the oxidative, aiming towards quiescence.

## GABA, CO2, and Thyroid

**Georgi Dinkov:** Regarding the GABA system—would it be counterproductive to target that specific system with agonists if you don't address the energetic deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can't have meaningful quiescence if you're simply exhausted. Drugs can be useful for a day or two to get rest, but you have to work on the actual metabolism. Progesterone and carbon dioxide suppress the excitotoxic systems and promote the GABA relaxing system.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Which is more systemically beneficial: thyroid hormone or carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They couldn't find any single-celled organism that can live continuously without carbon dioxide. It's the "without which there is no life."

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is thyroid function recoverable without supplementation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can adapt to 10,000 feet altitude and get a good diet, your thyroid will usually recover.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding thyroid dosing: Is it safer to dose half a grain at a time versus a full grain? You mentioned T3 causing a toxic overdose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With natural glandular material, if you take it with food, it isn't all digested for hours. I was referring to pure chemical T3. I experienced it myself taking 25 micrograms of T3 in the morning; my heart began pausing for seconds at a time. I found that taking 5 or 10 micrograms and rubbing it on the roof of my mouth restored perfect rhythm.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there an unsafe amount of T4 to take at a single time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** T4 is slowly metabolized. If you lack selenium and aren't converting it, it builds up and interferes with T3.

**Danny Roddy:** Would you chew the tablet or swallow it whole?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you need an immediate effect—like for heart rhythm or insomnia—chewing up 10 micrograms can work in minutes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Would it help to lower fatty acids (using niacinamide/aspirin) when taking thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's always good to keep free fatty acids low. In the case of glandular thyroid, unsaturated fats block the breakdown in your stomach.

## Physics and The Electric Universe

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have a strong opinion about what's going on in Antarctica?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not a bit.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the news about high-energy neutrinos coming out of the earth in Antarctica?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That would be very important if the earth is emitting them. Do you know Dudley's Neutrino Sea theory?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dudley argued that the universe is pervaded by a neutrino sea which has a dielectric effect. Neutrinos naturally associate with charged matter. I looked up a paper by a physicist named Anderson where he showed that the presence of a monolayer of radioactive material on a crystal regulated nuclear decay. This fits with Dudley's argument. He predicted that crystal structure could regulate nuclear decay and warned that nuclear fuel in weapons could become unpredictable.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So nuclear weapons might self-ignite?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If there is uranium ore at the South Pole, it could be focusing the neutrinos.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think Kozyrev was measuring in his "time" experiments?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically just energy. He did calculations to show why the passage of time is always adding energy to the system, which would involve Dudley's neutrino sea. He predicted volcanic activity on the moon based on this, which was later confirmed.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have an opinion on the "Electric Universe" theory and the documentary *Symbols of an Alien Sky*?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything is changing. I've read Velikovsky and I think his arguments about cataclysms are plausible.

## DHT Supplementation

**Danny Roddy:** What is your general thought on Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things like that are not to be messed with unless you have very specific knowledge of a deficiency. Correcting thyroid, vitamin D, DHEA, and pregnenolone will usually bring your DHT up to where it should be.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you see it ever being warranted to supplement with DHT directly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In something like breast cancer or prostate cancer, it can give a big push to the system. But generally, pregnenolone is the first thing, then DHEA. A strong androgen like DHT risks throwing off your neurosteroids.

**Danny Roddy:** If someone needed it, what would the dose be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One milligram daily dissolved in tocopherol or fat. But you have to have everything else in place first.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why does the endocrinological industry recommend insane doses of DHEA (25-50mg)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They simply don't know anything about their field. They are trained in an authoritarian system of obedience.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, if you had to leave the empire, what would be the breaking point for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When they interrupt my food and drugs. If they turn off my thyroid (Cynomel/Cynoplus) and start changing the food supply, then it's necessary to leave.

**Danny Roddy:** What about forced vaccinations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure.

**Danny Roddy:** How do you think they will incentivize a vaccine besides fear?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even normal doctors are starting to refuse vaccines for their kids. The vaccines might be a catalyst for people throwing off the whole crazy authoritarian medical system.

**Danny Roddy:** Great stuff, Ray. Infinite appreciation for you joining us. Thank you, Georgi, and thank you everybody listening. Take care.
