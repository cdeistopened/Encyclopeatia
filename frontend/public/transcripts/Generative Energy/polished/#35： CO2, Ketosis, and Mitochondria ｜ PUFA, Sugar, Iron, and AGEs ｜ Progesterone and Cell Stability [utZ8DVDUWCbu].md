---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, and we're live. Georgi Dinkov, Raymond Peat, thank you guys so much for joining us. Ray, how are you doing? And Georgi Dinkov, how are you?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Not bad, can’t complain. There are mobs marauding the streets of DC, but other than that seems to be okay.

**Danny Roddy:** We’re going to take some criticism of this show as we're not talking about nutrition enough. So I did want to, if Ray will humor us, go back to basics and talk about the role of progesterone, carbon dioxide, and the flow of electrons through the cell. I probably can't talk about this enough because it is really foundational to the bioenergetic perspective.

Could you paint a picture of what's happening when you're eating fats, proteins, and carbohydrates? How do they combine with oxygen? What role does thyroid have in that process going through the mitochondria, producing carbon dioxide, and how is that reciprocating the use of oxygen? And then what exactly is progesterone doing in that whole process?

## The Physics of Bioenergetics: Electron Flow and Structure

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Proteins are the basic substance of life. Protein is acidic, and that means it is electron-withdrawing and proton-releasing. This creates a pre-existing deficit of electrons once you have protein substance. Being acidic, it's already inclined towards oxidation. It is a high content of oxygen atoms on the polymers that creates the acidity of the proteins.

Jeremy England at MIT is working out the very basic physical principles of simply the crudest sense of the flow of energy. Shining light on simple molecules creates order. If you shine light on existing proteins, or in any way have an energy disequilibrium, you get a flow of energy through that gob of polymerized atoms. The flow of energy itself—as Jeremy England shows with simple atoms—will align these proteins according to where the electrons are flowing. If you have an oxidant on one end and an exciting electron source on the other, there's going to be a flow of energy that will create order in the polymer.

My experiment that convinced me that it's a very simple process was to stick two electrodes through an eggshell and measure the current flow and resistance as the voltage rises, and then as the voltage falls. With just an oscillating change in voltage, you get a very strong hysteresis loop. On the falling voltage, the flow of electrons is out of proportion; they flow very easily with little resistance because as the voltage increased, the proteins created a conductive channel. Walking makes the road, basically. Whenever you have energy flowing, you make the path easier for the next flow of energy.

**Danny Roddy:** It increases its appetite and capacity to use energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** During the process of development and evolution, you get all sorts of side channels of energy being drained off in creating different substances according to the voltage difference and availability of the atoms. The more complex it gets, the faster it gets more complex.

Vernadsky, early in the 20th century, worked out the implications of this: that the sun, as the source of energy flowing through substance, created order. Continuing the flow spontaneously leads to a higher and higher metabolic rate. The hysteresis curve—the bigger it gets, the more electrons it can conduct per second. As a consequence of that faster flow of electrons, you get a more complex system with a bigger brain, which creates and maintains that higher metabolic rate.

Almost at the same time, there were two or three people working out the medical, biological, and developmental implications of oxygen in a very practical way. Frederick Koch in the U.S., Otto Warburg, and Albert Szent-Györgyi were all seeing the creation of aspiring organisms as developing and progressing through the use of oxygen. They saw that when you interfere with this flow of electrons by doing something that blocks the ability to use oxygen, you revert to basically a slime metabolism—a very primitive, ancient, under-organized way of using energy. All three of them saw cancer as using a primitive, pre-oxidative metabolism.

## Carbon Dioxide as a Lewis Acid

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Overlapping with their studies, there were people working on the implications of carbon dioxide as the product of oxidative metabolism. The tendency is to not notice that carbon dioxide in itself is acidic. The common theory of acid in textbooks is the proton donor theory. But all of these physical ordering processes caused by oxygen are really the *electron retraction* theory of acidity.

Carbon dioxide doesn't have any protons, so if you think of proton release as the essence of an acid, you can't think of CO2 as an acid. But it's called a Lewis acid. Having two oxygens on one carbon, it's a very powerful electron binder. The instant it sits down on a protein, the protein shifts its electrons to be close to the center of the carbon dioxide molecule. So it increases the acidity. You have a pre-existing protein with acidity, and when you oxidize something and produce carbon dioxide, that intensifies the acidity. That's part of the sculpting effect of respiration. It intensifies whatever process was creating it in the first place. The more you breathe, the more able you are to breathe, in effect.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question in regards to solar energy. Given that most of the molecules that compose us are charged molecules, and we have this constant flow of energy in the form of photons from the sun, doesn't that automatically imply that randomness would be impossible in such an environment? There will always be an orientation, which means some kind of order which the sun will create.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just light streaming through gas creates order. When you look at ionizing radiation, they emphasize the disorder that it creates, but just the flow of light is giving it an order and direction.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was speaking to a physics professor about randomness recently, and he failed to give me a definition of a physical test for randomness. I said, "All of your tests are statistical." It always seems to be subjective based on the size of the data set.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a huge religious, philosophical assumption. It's sort of like original sin; you believe it, and then you follow all the consequences of believing it. About 50 years ago, I wrote an article on the assumption of randomness and all of the consequences that have come from that very arbitrary assumption.

## Thyroid, Proliferation, and the "Blob" State

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned Albert Szent-Györgyi. In his book *The Living State*, he said, "The ability of unlimited proliferation is an attribute of life... In multicellular organisms, this potential has to be suppressed in the interest of the organism as a whole... When the suppression mechanism is out of order, senseless growth can result." That's basically exactly what you're saying. When sugar and oxygen are blocked, we revert to this unlimited proliferation, blob-like state. That is the emblem of hypothyroidism—the person becoming definition-less.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is the essence of oxidation for living cells. Have you ever seen the experiment with a tadpole using a thyroid blocker or an excess of thyroid hormones? If you block the thyroid function, you get a giant infantile tadpole. If you give it an overdose of thyroid when the tadpole is maybe three-quarters of an inch long, you get a miniature frog about the size of a spider.

## Metabolic Landmarks: PFK, PDH, and Cytochrome C

**Danny Roddy:** What can go wrong in this process? You've talked about pivotal landmarks in cellular metabolism such as phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and cytochrome c oxidase. What are some big-picture things important for understanding the degradation of energy as we age? Maybe starting with PFK1—is that blocked by things like free fatty acids and stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just the choice between fat and carbohydrate matters. When you oxidize carbohydrate, you get extra carbon dioxide as a byproduct. It's like insurance that you're going to reinforce the oxidizing process. But oxidizing fat—even if it's a safe saturated fat—you don't get such a return of carbon dioxide, and that increases the risk of falling over into the lactate, glycolytic slime metabolism.

When you're starving, diabetic, or on a ketogenic diet, you're lowering the oxidative state of the cell. By making you less stable, it's opening up the opportunities for all of the processes of aging: creating collagen, free radical activities such as nitric oxide which can degrade your DNA. When you're perfectly at rest and in good health, it's okay to let your muscles have a pure fat diet. But as soon as you have any stress activity that makes you at risk of taking in too much oxygen relative to carbon dioxide, that starts increasing your nitric oxide production and collagen deposition.

**Danny Roddy:** A shout out to Jay Feldman for making me more aware of this. He says glucose oxidation produces about 25% more NADH and half as much FADH2 as fat oxidation. FADH2 donates electrons at complex II and reduces the amount of ubiquinone available to accept electrons at complex I. This backup of electrons is the main place where metabolism is shifted.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It might be the biggest factor, but I think everything tends to work together. Essentially everywhere a process is working, it tends to get biased when you're not overproducing carbon dioxide. Wasteful energy—in the sense of pouring out carbon dioxide and producing heat as your only product—is insurance.

**Danny Roddy:** He also mentioned complex I is one of the major sources of superoxide, which combines to produce nitric oxide. So fat metabolism is inherently increasing the production of nitric oxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Unless you get the whole stream going, pulling the electrons out at a maximum rate at the oxygen end. That attracts electrons that would otherwise make superoxide. The faster you run the apparatus, it creates an electron-withdrawing effect from the surrounding cells—an inclination towards a more carbon dioxide-like condition of the structure.

## Antioxidants vs. Oxidants

**Georgi Dinkov:** So something like methylene blue, which is technically an oxidizing agent, is also an antioxidant because it enables the flow of these electrons throughout the entire chain the way they're supposed to be. It prevents the formation of reactive oxygen species.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think all of these so-called antioxidants, like ascorbic acid, when it's really protecting you and working the way it should, it's a powerful oxidant. Dehydroascorbate is the predominant form in a healthy working cell, and that shifts in the direction of ascorbic acid (reduced form) in cancer and stress cells. The whole idea of antioxidants has been skewed heavily by denying the role of carbon dioxide and oxidation as a protective effect. The stronger the oxidation in the normal route, the safer you are. If you put in the reduced form of these so-called antioxidants, those will create destructive oxidation. Overloading on vitamin C in the reduced form will interact randomly with iron and create toxic, excited oxidative fragments.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Aren't reductants like estrogen and lactate also these types of "bad antioxidants" that destroy the system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lactate should stand out as a polar opposite of carbon dioxide. I think a basic medical test should be the level of lactate in your blood versus total carbon dioxide. The higher lactate gets, the closer you are to being dead.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the mere buildup of lactate is enough to derange the oxidative metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, you can inject Lactated Ringer's, for example, and cause toxic damage by shifting your system away from the oxidative state.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There used to be older studies showing that Ringer's lactate can cause seizures in susceptible people, but those studies seem to have stopped about 20 years ago.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just in the last 20 years or so, there's been a deification of lactic acid and lactate. It's essentially an irrational decriminalization of lactate.

## The NAD+/NADH Ratio

**Danny Roddy:** A few years ago, we talked about the NAD+/NADH ratio. I was reading a paper by Veech, and he stated that he thought the NADH should be higher relative to the NAD. Is that a common belief in academia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a very confused attitude towards NADH. It should be 700 NAD+ to each NADH. The oxidized form should be extreme. When you're under stress, it gets down more like 200 or 300 to one.

**Danny Roddy:** Since NAD is so popular now with those NAD drips, are people trying to pretend like they never held those beliefs before?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of them don't know about it, but they think they're raising their NADH. Lots of places are selling the reduced form of NADH as being better because it's reduced.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Higher NADH is one of the signals to turn off pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Some ketosis advocates, like Jeff Volek, talk about how that's a consequence of ketosis. What's the problem if PDH is turned off?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That makes the whole cell shift in that direction. Once it starts with the excess reducing environment, it tends to reinforce it and make it get worse.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If you turn off PDH, you're starting to immediately build up lactate because pyruvate will be used as the emergency oxidant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and to keep the production of lactate going, you need something to get rid of the buildup of higher levels of NADH. The intrinsic alternative to oxygen is the synthesis of fats. When the cell gets convinced that it isn't going to get enough oxygen, it starts synthesizing fatty acids like crazy. Estrogen and other stressors will turn on this enzyme system to consume excess NADH in the absence of oxygen. It runs glycolysis and lactic acid production, intrinsically changing the cell over to consuming energy at a high rate but in a destructive, primitivizing direction.

## Fat Oxidation and Estrogen

**Danny Roddy:** Sometimes they'll say fatty acids bypass glycolysis and form Acetyl-CoA, so it's good to skip glycolysis. What's the faulty thinking there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's going to deprive you of carbon dioxide production relative to what you could have with oxidizing glucose. The oxygen supply is the bottleneck. Things like lipid peroxidation and the lack of carbon dioxide interfere with our oxygen supply.

**Danny Roddy:** I read a paper recently showing that the fatty acid synthase enzyme and the beta-oxidation structure often form complexes with the estrogen receptor. So anytime you're over-oxidizing fat or synthesizing fats, you're also directly activating the estrogen system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And just the stress state—if you overheat a cell, that will activate the fatty acid synthase.

## Progesterone as Anti-Stress

**Danny Roddy:** You talked about using progesterone as your stress hormone. Can you unpack that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cholesterol is on the very primitive level. Cholesterol is the steroid stabilizing, pro-oxidative equivalent of progesterone. With higher organization, progesterone refines the functions of cholesterol in stabilizing and directing the cell to go down the organization-building pathways.

**Danny Roddy:** In an ideal world, if a person is producing lots of progesterone, is that used up before you activate the classical adrenal systems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain has its intrinsic machinery. The ovaries are just there to reinforce the organism so it's able to safely go through a pregnancy. But for everyone who isn't pregnant, the brain is our most intense progesterone factory.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In older studies by Selye, he showed that giving people pregnenolone decreases their excretion of 17-ketosteroids. He thought this meant pregnenolone is giving the adrenals a break without the negative effects of cortisol. Would you say pregnenolone fills in for some of the roles of cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An experiment in rats around 1950 gave them a huge dose of pregnenolone via stomach tube. Before the experiment, a proportion of them had above-normal levels of cortisol. Having received this gigantic dose of pregnenolone, all of them had normal levels of cortisol after that. It bypassed the need to produce cortisol. It works like cholesterol and progesterone to stabilize the organism so you don't need to resort to harmful things like aldosterone and cortisol.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned another rat study where they removed the adrenals, but as long as the rat had super-physiological levels of salt or progesterone, it could survive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Selye noticed that when he had the adrenal glands removed, they died very quickly under stress. But the females that were pregnant survived as long as they were pregnant. He decided to try non-pregnant animals, removing their steroids and supplementing progesterone, and they lived out practically normal, healthy lifespans without adrenal glands. It makes up not only for cortisol but for aldosterone and all of the other functions of the adrenals.

**Danny Roddy:** And progesterone is acting on the oxidation-reduction balance, but you said on a lower level it's ordering the water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you think of estrogen as doing everything that tends to excite the cell and move it to a lower, non-oxidizing energy system, progesterone knocks out those effects and gets the cell back on the oxidizing pathway.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Looking at the structure of progesterone compared to estrogen, progesterone is just four rings with two carbonyl groups. Doesn't that technically make it a quinone, similar to methylene blue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That carbonyl group, especially if it resonates with another double bond, is a very strong electron retractor. It is analogous to the carbon dioxide effect. The activated carbonyl group has that function, so when you see it in a molecule, it means that it's likely to be protective in some way.

## Lipid Peroxidation and Glycation

**Danny Roddy:** If the PUFA are essentially saying that some level of lipid peroxidation is desirable, almost nobody is saying that lipid peroxidation is a good process. It's exclusively harmful, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The good oxidation is very focused. Antioxidant in the sense of preventing things like chain reactions of polyunsaturated fat breakdown.

**Georgi Dinkov:** One of the major byproducts of lipid peroxidation is malondialdehyde, which is known to be mutagenic. Nothing that glucose oxidation produces ever generates such dangerous metabolites.

**Danny Roddy:** Isn't it the glycerol from the free fatty acids that is majorly forming the methylglyoxal, which is essential for the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that are blamed on glucose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Especially in the presence of polyunsaturated fats, the methylglyoxal starts to break down, and then those fragments of linoleic or arachidonic acid amplify the so-called glycation. It's predominantly a PUFA deterioration that counts as glycation.

**Danny Roddy:** If the person was hypoxic and sugar was being converted into lactic acid, that could contribute to methylglyoxal too, but not nearly as much as the glycerol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By shifting the redox in that direction, I think it intensifies that methylglyoxal metabolism. Once you get that shift towards lactate, you're shifting against carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide is a direct blocker of protein glycation.

## Cholesterol Esterification

**Georgi Dinkov:** Cholesterol is the fundamental primitive protector, but if there is an environment with lots of reactive oxygen species, cholesterol can get oxidized or esterified. Esterified cholesterol is a hallmark of aging. Do you think pregnenolone can fill in for the structural protection functions of cholesterol without the dangers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right in the mitotic apparatus, pregnenolone has a very central, primitive, essential function for cell division and stabilization. But the process that makes cholesterol form these esters—it's the polyunsaturated fatty acid ester of cholesterol which gets stuck in the cells because of an inflammatory process. I see lactic acid as starting the inflammatory process leading to the binding of PUFA to cholesterol and blocking the cell's ability to break it down.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the esterification of cholesterol with these PUFAs is essentially an emergency protective mechanism to decrease the availability of PUFA for producing inflammatory mediators?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't have the PUFA, you have an on-and-off of the saturated fatty acid ester, so it doesn't accumulate. But when it's polyunsaturated, the level builds up year after year in your blood vessels or brain.

## Sugars: Fructose, Sucrose, Trehalose

**Georgi Dinkov:** There is glucose, fructose, and then there's trehalose, the fungus sugar. Of the three, would you say that trehalose is potentially the safest in terms of not generating as much lactate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen enough experiments with mammalian cells to know how it works for maintaining the energy system. One of the reasons for preferring fructose or sucrose over starch and pure glucose is that ketone function has that biasing effect, putting the cell into a more oxidizing state. For example, the fatty liver effect of alcohol puts you in a highly reducing state. Fructose, at the right level, favors the oxidizing condition and acts as an antidote to the fatty liver producing effect of ethanol.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Since sucrose and trehalose are non-reducing sugars, wouldn't that be reason enough to use them as fuel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's my reason for preferring fructose and sucrose.

**Danny Roddy:** There is a mention of trehalose because the water bear (tardigrade) can survive lethal doses of radiation, and it looks like most of the sugar it uses is trehalose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there it's having the same effect that inositol does. It has a spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl groups that make it more effective than sugar as a stabilizer of proteins.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the human studies with inositol showing it cures treatment-resistant depression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it will eventually come into use as a situational defense like pregnenolone or progesterone. Studies have been done on various cells with X-irradiation showing that it is a powerful anti-radiation damage factor.

## History: Stalin, The CIA, and The Cold War

**Danny Roddy:** Switching gears, I've never received so much email about something than our last talk about Stalin. Have you heard of CIA Project Aerodynamic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I never heard of it.

**Danny Roddy:** It was a CIA scheme to create anti-Russian propaganda. I was reading an article by Andrew Gavin Marshall called "Origins of American Empire." He talks about the opposition of Stalin to the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers who wanted to take over the oil fields of Russia. Does that line up with your view of history?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, well, the German system very early got integrated through the Dulles brothers with what became the CIA. The British and the Germans were early aiming to destroy the Russian Empire because they had other plans for that part of the world. Stalin was aware of these imperialist motives. Even though he was a Georgian, he saw the Russian Empire as less evil than the British and German empires. So he was essentially a patriot as well as a labor leader.

Several of the top Bolsheviks, especially Lenin, were at one point subsidized by the Germans and probably the British. Trotsky very definitely by this Dulles faction that included the Germans and the Rothschilds. Trotsky went through the whole Bolshevik period as essentially a German saboteur. After Lenin died, Stalin remained an organizer against the British and German interests, whereas Trotsky continued right up until the time he was murdered to be effectively working with the FBI, British, and German intelligence.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think Trotsky's murder had more to do with Stalin or Western intelligence agencies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always assumed it was Stalin because the Moscow trials of 1937 and '38 brought out such overwhelming evidence that he was deeply involved with all of the imperialists.

**Danny Roddy:** Besides the CIA program focused on anti-Russian sentiment, what else is there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's much deeper than the CIA. The CIA is just a surface organization. They used money from the Marshall Plan to penetrate every place they could. If you look at the Wall Street Putsch or the Business Plot against Roosevelt revealed by Smedley Butler—when Butler exposed their plan, they just made longer-range plans to take effect when the Second World War was over.

The Hitler faction—people who had medals awarded by Hitler—were in control of the democratic big city machines during the war. They rigged the 1944 Democratic convention to install their agent, the Dulles puppet Harry Truman, to take over the government. The Dulles brothers meanwhile had deeply integrated themselves with the Nazi intelligence apparatus. What we know as the CIA simply continued the German basic purpose of working with the banks to rule the world in favor of the corporations.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is at the core of this fundamental opposition between the West and the East, with Russia being at its center?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The empires made it very obvious what they wanted. The British Empire wanted to control the world and enslave that whole landmass. The Germans were envious and thought they could knock out the British Empire. The US and the bankers outsmarted the German nationalists. Because the Soviet Union was powerful enough to say, "We're not going to participate in your plans," that automatically made them target public enemy number one in the eyes of the financial powers.

**Danny Roddy:** So you can't really understand the framing of Stalin without understanding his opposition to the banker families?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, he was actually defending the interests of the majority of the Russian people.

## Modern Politics, Technocracy, and Eugenics

**Danny Roddy:** The Nazi philosophy is the eugenics philosophy, and that is what we're all going through right now. Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep. It was slightly embarrassed at the end of the World War, so they had to change the names of their eugenics journals to "Human Biology" or "Human Genetics," but the ideas didn't change. There has been steady progress against the more humanistic strains of American civilization, supplanted by the Dulles brothers' alliance with the German and bankers factions.

**Danny Roddy:** At the moment there are two power factions: the liberal/technocratic (Soros, Gates) and then Trump, who is aligned with religious prophecy. In this situation, the Trump people are more pro-life than these genocidal eugenics people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Unfortunately, the most humanistic trend has got connected with the craziest groups. But they have things in common in that they do want the mass citizenry in chains in some way, shape, or form.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that why there is an acquiescence to things like vaccines or lockdowns?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You know, right after he was elected, Trump invited Robert Kennedy Jr. to Washington to talk to him about heading a commission to investigate vaccines. Then Pfizer donated a million dollars, and Trump called Kennedy and told him the deal was off.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you know there was a civil lawsuit filed by the surviving relatives of MLK, and a court decision decided that MLK was the victim of a government-led conspiracy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the evidence is overwhelmingly clear. The same person who wrote *JFK and the Unspeakable* attended the whole trial of the MLK assassination and made a really convincing case.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you ever met a person who has even heard of that trial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No American that I've ever met. And probably very few people have heard that Robert Kennedy Jr. knows exactly who the agent was that killed his father—the security guard that shot him in the back of the head.

## COVID-19 and Germ Warfare

**Danny Roddy:** I sent you a link to a movie called *Cold Case Hammarskjöld*. They find a key witness who mentions a unit spreading AIDS through vaccines. In your estimation, is the delivery of vaccines just a diabolical concept in general?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the evidence is indirect, but you can't look at the contextual situation without knowing that they were trying to make something like HIV. People working at the germ warfare lab were talking about the intent to make a racially specific lethal virus.

**Danny Roddy:** Assuming Coronavirus was created in a lab, it's not that deadly. So maybe the vaccine is the death agent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the big picture is that they have made a lot of noise going back years that they were working on this sort of thing. The Chinese, being sensitive to American germ warfare, would react very quickly to any virus. It was like sending a very pointed message to China, getting them to react powerfully and shut down their economy. But the whole purpose, I think, was an excuse: "Look, the Chinese did it, we have to shut down our economy."

Eric Schmidt's publications and speeches laid out that plan over a year ago. Destroying the existing economy is necessary so we can beat China to the automation/artificial intelligence economy. We have to destroy this old economy made up of small and medium-sized businesses.

**Danny Roddy:** Who is Schmidt aligned with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Pentagon was a financier of Google, so he was a Pentagon ally before Google came into existence.

## Aging, Appearance, and Health

**Danny Roddy:** I've been struggling with the concept of a person's rate of aging versus how healthy they are. Maybe somebody could look aesthetically like they're not aging quickly, but they could be extraordinarily sick?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. Hypothyroid people often have bones that are late to mature, and the mucopolysaccharides in their skin make their skin look very youthful into their 50s. Then the underlying problems accumulated from hypothyroidism show up, and they crash into heart disease or dementia very suddenly. It's just keeping the skin stretched. When you feed a cow a lot of estrogen, it retains water and looks shiny and sleek.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen Eric Schmidt's face? It's always shiny.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Growth hormone is analogous in some ways to estrogen. It increases the deposition of ground substance and can make things plump up, but they're being degraded structurally.

## Dietary Recommendations

**Danny Roddy:** A 17-year-old degenerating structurally versus a 25-year-old adapting to stress—both are sickness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Sometimes just a low protein diet can lead to a very high cortisol/androgen ratio. That makes your skin look aging even when you're 17. That can be countered by getting your calcium and protein intake increased, vitamin D, and thyroid correction.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think protein requirements decrease with age? There are studies showing life extension with low protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think what they're doing is keeping down the methionine, tryptophan, and cysteine, which are the pro-aging parts of the protein. If you get lots of glycine and gelatin in your diet, the protein doesn't have those age-advancing effects.

**Danny Roddy:** If you were going to sit down and have some beef, would you balance it with calcium, gelatin, or drink coffee to inhibit iron absorption?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would drink milk or eat eggshells. Balancing the phosphate would have priority.

**Danny Roddy:** It is very popular to talk about iron right now. But is it the estrogen, hypoxia, and low thyroid that is making the iron accumulate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The amount of estrogen present in pregnancy causes an extreme increase in the efficiency of iron absorption. Everything that estrogen does tells your body that something is wrong with your respiration system, so it increases your ability to retain iron. But in fact, it reaches a point where it starts competing with copper and aging the system.

**Danny Roddy:** So iron overload is actually hyperestrogenemia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so in most cases.
