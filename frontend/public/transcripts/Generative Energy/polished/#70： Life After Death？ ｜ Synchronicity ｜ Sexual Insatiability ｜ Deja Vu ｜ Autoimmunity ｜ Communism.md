---## Introduction and Global Politics

**Danny Roddy:** Welcome to Generative Energy Podcast #70. Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov. Ray, I just interrupted you, but we were talking before about your take on Australia? I thought you had an interesting take that I really haven't heard before.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For several decades, it has seemed that they've been heavily manipulated by the CIA or whoever the world manipulators are. I see their extreme reactions as being a test case for how fast they can get away with imposing stuff on different parts of the world. But I think the reaction there is strong enough that maybe they're going to hold back and think of something a little less crude for the US and Europe.

**Danny Roddy:** We also talked about why the power elites would want to turn the US into a third-world country. We were talking about the possibility that the citizenry of the US are the last remaining threat to the power elite. Once they were subdued, they could do all their illicit activities without any interruption.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of her recent videos, Lee Merritt, an anti-vax physician, said that in her state the number of people who own guns would be the equivalent of the fifth largest army in the world. They don't simply own guns; they also regularly shoot them. Maybe they're not on par with an active military, but they can put up a pretty decent resistance if things really start getting ugly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even though the firepower is like a million to one in favor of the Pentagon, the actual ground-level situation—if you have a thousand people with little guns and a hundred soldiers with bazookas and tanks—becomes a better balance.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the Pentagon has managed to vet its most loyal soldiers to the point where they're completely confident that none of these people will turn on them if they're being ordered to attack their own families?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's the purpose of Biden's talking about dishonorable discharge for people who don't get vaccinated. He doesn't want any ambiguous people ambivalent about following orders. Once he gets the vaccine resistors out, then he's got a nice robot army.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So we can expect something really bad when all those soldiers are vaccinated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they're really giving them the same vaccine that is causing the CDC's death and disability numbers to rise astronomically, then it's going to weaken the army. But I would suppose that they know better than to give the regular vaccines to anyone they want to rely on.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you see that the CDC chief overruled her own advisory committee? The advisory committee said most people don't need a booster, and she overruled them. Is that legal under federal law? Does the agency have supreme power?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The agency's concept are internal regulations. I've interacted with some agencies that just really didn't take their own regulations seriously.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So these advisory committees are largely ceremonial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just for giving it a little prestige.

**Danny Roddy:** I'm looking for an article talking about how during H1N1, the government class was issued different vaccines than the population.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several people have been talking about the evidence that several different vaccines or non-vaccines have been issued and the elite get the non-vaccines.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Just a week after it emerged that German armed forces were getting a different kind of H1N1 vaccine to the general population, *Der Spiegel* magazine reports that the government will also get special treatment.

## Legal Liability and Economic Shifts

**Danny Roddy:** You sent me Dolores Cahill's video, and she was talking about an interesting way of holding people accountable that were forcing vaccines on people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A personal liability lawsuit is one of them. Another one was making them aware of the fact that they're committing a crime. If they do anything to coerce someone in any way, but especially to take an experimental medical treatment, that is worse than simple undefined coercion. Coercion is a felony in some states and a serious misdemeanor in all the rest. Federal law allows up to three years in prison for coercion.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But these lawsuits would only apply to the private industry, because the government officials have qualified immunity, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but your employer who is administering the illegal regulation would undoubtedly say they were just following orders. That has not been working very well.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So even though OSHA can mandate the employer, the employer is caught between a rock and a hard place.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And if the employees make it expensive by suing their employers for damages if they get fired, then the company has to start thinking which side they'll take.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Many of the small ones will probably simply fold, which I'm starting to think may be one of the desired side effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The plan as expressed by Eric Schmidt more than two years ago was in line with the Rockefeller Foundation and other long-range plans. The Pentagon Committee that Eric Schmidt was the chairman of outlined the need to destroy the existing economy of the United States so that it could be quickly replaced by a digital artificial intelligence economy. That was expressed in 2019 before there was a pandemic.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You can see this basically: we all shop from Amazon, we all get our IT from Google, and we all get our health care from a single mandatory provider.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And as the small businesses went broke, Amazon and other giant corporations just about doubled their wealth.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The office building where my office is went bankrupt and BlackRock moved in and bought all the real estate in D.C. Do you have opinions on Vanguard and BlackRock owning a lot of the huge major corporations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw someone analyzing the tentacles of Vanguard. They're everywhere with five or six percent ownership where they can have a strong influence. They're just about identical with the World Economic Forum in their policies and reach.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The guest who owns the private funds behind Vanguard is basically a who's who of the neocons: the Bush family, the Rumsfeld family, the Clintons, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.

## Strategies of Confusion

**Danny Roddy:** I was interested in getting your take on the incoherent narratives that conflict. Just watching Fauci contradict himself a hundred times. Do you think that is a strategy of terror and confusion to inactivate people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's natural for them to just talk through their hat. And it turns out that that also is producing confusion and working in the direction they want people to go: panic and confusion.

**Danny Roddy:** I have a book by Kurt Lewin from the Tavistock Institute. He says if we just confuse people enough, they won't know what to do. Even if you're a renegade, you will be inactive because there is no clear path forward.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's basically what they do in the US. The people that consider themselves radicals are aligned with Citibank and Wells Fargo with the exact things they believe.

**Georgi Dinkov:** During the 2016 election, I noticed that the Communist Party of the US was supporting Hillary Clinton. That's a perfect example of confusing people to be utterly useless.

## Immunity and Tissue Injury

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you are working on something regarding immunity. Did you want to talk about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm writing about development and immunity and how the whole system has been warped so much that it's almost impossible to talk about how the immune system works. It's a perfect background for people saying ridiculous things about vaccines because there's no solid ground for making a decisive argument. You have to see the history going back more than 100 years to see why the situation is so muddled.

**Danny Roddy:** Did Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger ever get taken seriously? Was that static view of immunity ever a real contender against the traditional view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Jamie Cunliffe and his "Danger Hypothesis"—I think he got right to the center of the issue, but he hasn't been keeping up with his studies. Polly Matzinger's ideas have been to some extent adopted by the mainstream, but in the process, their meaning has been lost. It has gone the whole clonal selection route right down the mainstream.

**Danny Roddy:** If I could summarize that point of view: tissue injury comes before any kind of bacteria or fungi. If you're worried about immunity, you should be worrying about limiting tissue injury.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Our body is concerned with coming into existence, maintaining that existence, and improving it. The Cunliffe idea is that when something goes wrong—mechanical, radiation, chemical damage, or an organism—it's the damage that our body is concerned with. In the process of fixing that damage, it takes out the pathogen. The body takes measures necessary to maintain its integrity, not really designed to attack enemies. It's the process of optimizing the self that has a sideline of developing antibodies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There are studies showing that specific occupations, like boxers, had a much higher rate of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis because they continuously damage their joints. Hasn't this attracted attention?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very little. Twenty-five or thirty years ago, I saw a single article where they took a piece of cow cartilage. When it was fresh, it didn't elicit antibodies. But if they just twisted the cartilage—gave it mechanical stress—then it elicited antibodies. That was an image of how easy it is to induce the antibody reactions you see in autoimmune conditions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the recent studies confirming that endotoxin is directly responsible for the flares of rheumatoid arthritis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I've been following that general line that any injuries to the tissue will bring up the so-called autoimmune system. Virus infections in some experiments were lethal if the organism wasn't allowed to produce antibodies. The antibody itself was there mostly to clear out the damaged tissue rather than to attack the virus.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think chronic low-grade endotoxemia can be a factor in many of these autoimmune conditions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and things like lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's, and probably MS. In lupus, I've seen clear diagnoses where correcting their vitamin D, calcium intake, progesterone, and thyroid caused all symptoms to disappear and a regression of the antibodies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So you're saying you don't need to go on the carnivore diet if you have an autoimmune disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Keeping your blood glucose up and your carbon dioxide high from oxidizing glucose—those are the basic anti-inflammatory things that will correct all of the autoimmune diseases.

**Georgi Dinkov:** When a person does eat an all-meat diet and experiences an improvement, that would probably be a reduction in endotoxin, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Many people are eating indigestible stuff that causes inflammation of their intestine. A meat diet will simply represent the absence of toxic indigestible foods, giving quick relief like a fast. But after you are on that diet for a while, the excitatory inflammatory effect of the unbalanced phosphate and iron intake eventually brings up other problems just as serious.

**Danny Roddy:** Where would you put endotoxin in the complex biochemical web of stress substances?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a constant threat everywhere and all the time. Bad diet choices will make it take over, but even with the best diet, a physical or emotional shock can reduce the barrier function of the intestine enough to absorb more endotoxin.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I saw old studies suggesting the main mechanism of increased gut barrier permeability during stress was estrogen. Do you share that view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. The capillaries are where the intestine barrier is most important, and everywhere in the body, estrogen weakens the capillary barrier.

## Fertility and Hormones

**Danny Roddy:** Marcelo asks: Have you ever seen or heard of a woman regaining her fertility taking high dose progesterone? Someone infertile for a decade or more.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was teaching nutrition classes, there were several women who said they had been infertile for more than 10 years. Usually, two or three people during that three-month class would suddenly get pregnant just with diet changes to increase progesterone and thyroid and get estrogen under control. One woman, a medical doctor, had diagnosed ovarian failure at 35. By carefully taking a blood test every week or two, she imitated the natural hormones of the cycle with small amounts of thyroid and progesterone. She had been infertile for over 10 years and had a baby very quickly as soon as she got her blood test showing the hormones in the right range.

## Posture and Health

**Danny Roddy:** Thoughts on the importance of posture and health. Does good posture come from good health or vice versa?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think good health makes you feel springy and energetic, so you take on the aspect of a springy, energetic person. If everything hurts and you're tired, naturally everything is going to slump.

**Danny Roddy:** I think you once wrote about DHEA and testosterone causing slumping?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and pregnenolone and progesterone work with them. The fascia that hold up your skin, in the absence of those protective steroids, go limp. Just a dose of pregnenolone will cause the fascia to contract, showing they have the properties of smooth muscle cells. If the fascia get loose, the tendons and capsules all get slack. It can lead to the prolapse of the uterus, for example. A woman told me her doctor planned surgery to pin her uterus back, but she used a mixture of DHEA and progesterone, and her uterus normalized.

## Evolution and Diet

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray think it's possible that apes are actually devolved human beings?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've joked about that a lot. If vegetarians found a congenial environment where they could eat all the vegetables they wanted, their intestine would get bigger and their brain would get smaller. A poor diet very powerfully limits the growth of your brain.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Evolution can work backwards too. If monkeys eat mostly leaves and fruit, aren't the leaves rich in keto acids? Why would that be a poor diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because they're full of toxins. If you look at the areas where the biggest brains of fossils have been found, an abundance of fruit would provide the high calorie guarantee needed for maintaining the very expensive brain. The hunting diet, if you eat lots of meat, doesn't necessarily provide the very high concentration of glucose. The more meat you eat, the more insulin you secrete. If you aren't taking in carbohydrate, the meat will give you chronically increased cortisol and a tendency towards hypoglycemia.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You're telling me Klaus Schwab wanting us all to eat bugs is on the right track?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once I had some very nice things that seemed to be little fish patties, but they turned out to be mosquito larvae. Around Lake Pátzcuaro in Mexico, they used to skim the mosquito larvae with big nets. They had a pleasant, mildly fishy taste.

## Consciousness, Memory, and Metaphysics

**Danny Roddy:** What does Dr. Peat think about life after death?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I never really think about it. A physics professor, J.O'M. Bockris, wrote about the history of communicating with the dead in his book *The New Paradigm*. It has interesting historical discussions of fairly convincing information transfer from post-living people to presently living people.

**Danny Roddy:** A YouTube comment suggested that when you die, you go down to a lower level of energy metabolism and a lower level of consciousness. Does that sound right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's on a completely different level. The neutrino sea idea as the ether for interaction of all substance—gravity, electricity—has pretty good evidence. The neutrino sea can resonate for a very low energy of the appropriate frequency. I think that's where telepathic and transgenerational communication works.

**Danny Roddy:** So do you think what we call the soul may be something like a standing wave in the neutrino sea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So what we experience as ancestral memories could be just resonating with those standing waves that are still there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think deja vu is resonating with a past brain state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Our ordinary consciousness is constantly foreseeing a little bit of the future. We ordinarily only project a few seconds into the future. But the brain is very oriented towards forming an image of what's about to come. Sometimes the deja vu experience is when something slips in your brain, and you forget to ignore enough of what's coming in, and suddenly you see what's to come for maybe 10 or 15 seconds ahead.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think of synchronicity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are a couple of very good books on synchronicity. F. David Peat has a good one. I think the ether or the neutrino sea is guiding causality enough that sometimes things will choose to happen because you're ready to perceive them.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There have been cases of people undergoing brain surgery and waking up speaking a foreign language they never learned.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One case was a woman who had been a cleaning lady in an academic organization. Just being present, when she had a brain accident, suddenly she could speak the languages that she had been around but not knowingly attending to.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the Hinduistic ideas of Akasha?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that sort of thing has been developing for thousands of years. There's this idea that under certain circumstances you can tune in and know much more than ordinary knowing could produce. Like the Gordon Wasson story of the magic mushroom. The shaman told him something very serious was going on with his son in New York, which turned out to be true.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the process of learning, would it be fair to say that it's the change of the structure of that standing wave in the Neutrino Sea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. I began seeing consciousness as something electronic or finer—a coherence of electrons. I visualize the process of consciousness in the brain as being this jelly-like ethereal material that we push around with our biological activity. But what's really happening is that we are the resonance process in this conductive substance.

## Dental Health

**Danny Roddy:** Please ask Dr. Peat about the safety of dental implants.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The stories I've read about the failures have made such an impression on me. I've heard about the jawbone disintegrating to the point that they have to put a metal jawbone in.

**Danny Roddy:** I have a plastic retainer. Is that doing devastating things?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just plastic over your tooth, I don't think it hurts anything especially. But to dig right into the bone and put a foreign object inside just doesn't make biological sense.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So dentures would be safer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, all kinds of restoration are preferable. Crowns can often be done on a basically destroyed tooth.

## Vaccines and Variants

**Danny Roddy:** What is the purpose of the booster shot for COVID and how does it relate to the variant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It increasingly looks clear that the variants are nothing but the side effects of the various nucleic acid treatments. It looks like there might not be any such thing as a gamma or delta variant, but simply that it's a name being given to the symptoms produced by the original vaccine. If that's the case, then the booster shot is just going to produce more so-called variants.

## Social Structures and Anarchism

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray identify himself as a social anarchist?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I think organization, if it's allowed to develop, will be what suits the people on the ground level. You'll have consumers' cooperatives and producers' cooperatives. If that's allowed to develop, they will find the best way to cooperate on a larger scale.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It seems to me that the social structure is a metabolite of the health of the people building them. If people are healthy, they can thrive under a variety of systems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because different cultures, for example, military-oriented cultures, are very tightly connected with child abuse, body mutilation, and repression of sexuality. Those things are closely tied with sadistic group policies. You don't want one of those societies to take over a larger government.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So eternal vigilance is the price of freedom even for healthy people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Until two or three generations, you might outgrow the sadistic tendencies that have been inculcated for so long.

## Estrogen, Sexuality, and Pheromones

**Danny Roddy:** What is the role of estrogenic predominance in sexual orientation and paraphylic disorders?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the problems with high estrogen is that it doesn't allow sexual satisfaction. It's the prod to seek satisfaction. It requires a good balance of thyroid, progesterone, and androgens to achieve satisfaction. High estrogen can lead to insatiability and has a toxic excitatory effect on the brain.

**Danny Roddy:** Is celibacy dangerous?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's always a result of an imposition. Sadistic cultures suppress women's sexuality in particular.

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray think homosexuality is optimal normalcy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The evidence from history and animal experiments is that you can produce it by stress during gestation. Everyone is abnormal in some way. It isn't something law should regulate, but the evidence is clear that it's a particular product of both prenatal and early life stresses.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen studies demonstrating that finasteride can reliably induce homosexuality in animals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't seen that.

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks about pheromones. Can a woman's lack of interest in her long-term partner be due to pheromones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good diet and hormone activity is the best thing to optimize the pheromones. It's true that both men and women have less of the attractive pheromones and probably gradually increase some repellent pheromones as they age. I think little kids emit anti-sexual pheromones that induce parental attitudes. Around puberty, the chemistry changes towards sexual attraction.

**Danny Roddy:** What is a pheromone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It can be any chemical that is volatile enough that you can detect it at some distance. The most clearly defined human pheromones are derivatives of androgenic steroids.

## History and Ideology

**Danny Roddy:** What are Ray's thoughts on Adolf Hitler and his expulsion of banking cartels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He had many right perceptions, but in a very crooked way. All of the money and bank powers of Germany, England, and the US concentrated on supporting him as the barrier against Bolshevism. He told the voters he would give them socialism, but he told the bankers there would be "National Socialism" that wouldn't benefit anyone outside of German society. He was following the instructions of the money system.

**Danny Roddy:** How might Ray respond to the question of why worker ants are sent out into dangerous conditions while queen ants are protected?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Individual ants can be intelligently altruistic one ant to another.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is Ray Peat a communist?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure what the difference is between that and anarchism if you define them thoughtfully. You want to get rid of tyranny and have cooperation. The idea of communism essentially goes back to Christianity. You could say Christian beliefs are at base predominantly communistic.

## Obesity Interventions

**Danny Roddy:** For an extremely morbidly obese person (300+ lbs), what are the first steps? Fasting? Liposuction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the alternatives are extremely harmful. Liposuction usually causes nerve damage and liberation of free fats. A fast is dangerous because that fat is going to travel through your brain and liver, exposing you to prolonged toxicity.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about chemical interventions like DNP?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Overdosing on thyroid does the same thing. At the right level, it can increase your safe oxidation of fats. Both DNP and thyroid, carefully controlled, can reduce the toxicity of getting rid of the fat. A diet high in calcium and vitamin D should be part of the program to support safe oxidation.

## Vaccine Mitigation

**Danny Roddy:** If forced to be inoculated, are there any supplements or diet that will counteract the harmful side effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing is to consider your defenses and avoid getting it put into you. The animal evidence is that there could be terrible long-range effects. The fact that the so-called variants are increased in the vaccinated suggests the disease effects of the virus and vaccine are essentially identical—primarily through the toxic effects of the spike protein. Angiotensin receptor blockers, antihistamines, and aspirin were known to protect against the toxic effects of the spike protein.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does the mRNA in the vaccine use the same mechanism through the ACE2 enzyme to get inside the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nothing I know of. They're using a lipid for getting the RNA quickly into the cells, but other studies show that you don't really need the lipid. It will be taken up even in the naked RNA form. This particular fat happens to take the highest concentration in the ovaries.
