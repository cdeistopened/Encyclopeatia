---# Abiotic Oil and the Origin of Life

**Danny Roddy:** This guy, Tom—what's his last name? He's the one considered to have invented the abiotic oil theory, at least for Western chemistry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thomas Gold. And the intrinsic heat of the giant planets, that is still being confirmed. The giant gas planets are emitting heat in proportion to their mass. And that's consistent with the whole planetary creation of everything that happens on the planet. It is not just driven by solar energy, but the internal chemistry of the planet.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So do you think in that case, things like peak oil are just another political psyop that's basically created to feed the narrative of climate change and the Great Reset and so on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The deep ocean vents are emitting organisms, basically. A whole ecology up to worms. In the super hot ocean water, the high pressure lets them tolerate the heat, and the volcanic emissions into the ocean water are providing the life-supporting system. I think that's a model of how life originated. Hot rocks and gas interacting with water, producing very quick, highly developed ecologies. And the whole story of gradual evolution, I think, is really just looking at how the phases of the Earth's development turn out rather than random gene accumulation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, if I can make a jump here, evolution is an energetically driven process. It doesn't necessarily proceed in a straight line or even progress all the time. It really depends on the energetic supplies of the environment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. But the novel thing is to see it driven from the inside of the planet rather than just from the sun.

## Ancient Civilizations and Human History

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there were times during Earth's history when there were organisms—or maybe even if you read mythology—human races or humanoid-like beings that were more advanced than us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There have been fossil observations of what seemed to be petrified human-like things in rocks that were believed to be millions of years old. All of those extreme anomalies get people to include them in literature and such, but they don't make it into the science journals.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with Hindu mythology? They have these periods of development in the universe, and apparently right now we're living in the period that's the least beneficial for organisms, called Kali Yuga. Their mythology says that in the past there were periods when the environment was much more conducive for civilization and consciousness. The human beings of these past eras were 10 feet tall and living 900 years, which immediately led me to thinking of the Boskop skull and the stories of the Bible of Methuselah living 900 years. Do you think all of these things could be talking about the same phenomena?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and even in the last 100 years or so, we see extreme differences in lifespans. The official biology industry just says that it's all lies, but the churches have been keeping birth records on people for hundreds of years. The records are there showing people, quite a few, well over 150 years old.

## Energy Sources and Cell Membranes

**Danny Roddy:** In terms of civilizational development, do you think there's an optimal energy source? I would think you would be heavily against nuclear power, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Volcanic power is the obvious thing.

**Danny Roddy:** Basically converting that to geothermal energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It's generously available and easy to get.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding life arising from the ocean, Szent-Györgyi had a thesis that we couldn't leave the ocean until we figured out how to bring it with us, like the water in our bodies. Is that on the right track?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I don't think that's the membrane people are talking about. They had to invent genes that could make a seal membrane that would let the cell hold water. But primitive proteins spontaneously generated in a few minutes in the lab by Sidney Fox—those proteins are water regulatory and create their own appearance of a membrane. They have a very standard, regular size, and they can assimilate new proteins. When they do, they bud off just like a yeast, forming a little sphere that assimilates more protein and grows up to the standard size, at which point it buds. So all of this is something that happens in a matter of hours in the experimental laboratory, and the evolutionists are just trying to hang on to their picture of history and how a cell requires a membrane.

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, well, you mentioned how life can be the volcanoes and the creation of life in the water. How does that translate to eventually forming us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a volcano happens to be near the edge of the ocean or just in a place that gets rained on, then you get the same thing happening just with the drier surroundings. But the proteins regulate the ocean to keep out excess water, and they regulate the air environment to keep in the right amount of water. It's hygrophilic enough that it's self-regulating for the water and mineral content.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the ocean plays the role of the—what was that experiment that recently was done? Somebody threw water on really hot rock and then amino acids started spontaneously emerging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's Sidney Fox that created the spontaneous cell-like spheres.

## Spontaneous Generation and Evolution

**Danny Roddy:** I have *The Biosphere* by Vladimir Vernadsky here. He says, "Creatures on Earth are the fruit of extended complex processes and are an essential part of the harmonious cosmic mechanism." And then you have a quote about an old interview where you say, "Talking about purpose, you speak more like a religious person, but this whole idea of energy being thrown into a system and complexifying," that's kind of what Vernadsky was talking about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mm-hmm. Things spontaneously organize and create higher and higher organized structures.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In terms of driving the course of evolution, do you think it's the Earth's internal activity and energetic balance that's a bigger factor, or solar activity and other planets?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The present condition on Earth is being slightly modified and directed by changes that interact between planets and the sun. But the same basic tendency to basically create hotter, faster, bigger brains that organize bigger, longer-lived organisms—that's the general drift that Vernadsky talked about.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the work of this young professor at MIT [Jeremy England] who basically said that life is simply an energy-dissipating mechanism? You can measure the complexity of life by measuring the intensity of the energy-dissipation process, which is just another word for metabolism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And there's a Russian that—I think he died about 20 or 30 years ago—that had carried on the idea to study the energy dissipation in an egg. He described the process as an egg unscrambling itself by the intensity of the energy that it produces. So in other words, it's the energy dissipation that keeps the egg from randomizing itself, and the same thing for all life. It's a generator of higher and higher order.

## Aging and the "Mortal" Cell

**Georgi Dinkov:** What was the name of the guy who challenged Hayflick, and he had the opposite idea? He said that cells are immortal, and he did his experiments with chicken embryos.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alexis Carrel.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Carrel, yeah. If you read the official story, they said he was a fraud.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It always has to be a fraud. Anything that is very clear and obvious, it had to be that these technicians over a period of 20 years were all participating in a fraud to introduce new chickens.

**Georgi Dinkov:** When do you think that drive started happening to prove that life on its own decays and basically that's our destiny? Because it seems like in the early 20th century, everybody believed based on the available evidence that cells were immortal unless harassed externally by a bad environment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mendel really started it as his attempt to disprove all of Charles Darwin's unorthodox Lamarckism. Mendel was going to prove that genes are immortal and that it's only the similar body that's mortal. And that was taken up by August Weismann in the 1890s. He was the guy that amputated the tails of 1,200 mice and said their offspring still had tails, so Lamarck and Darwin were wrong.

He advocated the "wear and tear" cause of aging because the genes are immortal and they spin off the dregs. He said the process of differentiating was a progressive loss of potential as it thins out the inheritance genes. So this somatic dregs is just constantly wearing out the way a machine wears out because there's no mechanism for renewal. That set the tone for the 1900 rediscovery of Mendel and the creation of the so-called neo-Darwinian view in which Darwin is censored. The genetics industry was committed to this idea of the mortal body being a machine.

## Genetics vs. Environment

**Georgi Dinkov:** So speaking of genes and evolution, I guess at this point it's probably clear that genes are not the drivers of evolution. They're just simply the result of it, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Sidney Fox, in demonstrating that his artificial cells could not only assimilate nutrients and increase their size and numbers, added the makings of nucleic acids—just the free bases that our DNA synthase system turns into genes. He fed these nucleic acid precursors to his protocells, and with only the spontaneously formed proteins, they polymerized the precursors into DNA-like substances.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there are missing pieces in the current theory of evolution? For example, they're saying that humans and chimpanzees are very close relatives, but there's no archaeological evidence of a common ancestor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All kinds of alternatives are possible. For example, one is that a vegan tribe decided to restrict their diet to leaves and an occasional bug, and that caused them to expand their digestive system and get big bellies, and to not be able to support such big brains, and they turned out looking like chimpanzees.

If you look at the implications of what Sidney Fox did—that amino acids spontaneously make proteins which spontaneously are able to make analogs of DNA—then you've got the central dogma of the Watson-Crick approach to genetics reversed. They said that information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, never the other way. But Sidney Fox showed that information is generated spontaneously in proteins, and that they can then insert order in the precursors and actually make DNA from protein.

**Danny Roddy:** I posted a clip of us talking about evolution, and one of the comments was, "How could what Ray was talking about be possible, because everybody knows we evolved under very harsh circumstances?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, I think the real evolution was happening in the tropics with good diet and happiness. When people drifted off trying wheat-based industry and agriculture, some of them created the dairy industry and continued evolving. Others didn't do so well and degenerated into war-loving tribes.

**Danny Roddy:** But a level deeper... the achievement of the human organism would have to have been maintained in an oxidized redox balance, and that would be impossible under extremely harsh conditions. Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Just the whole idea that the brain requires an abundance of energy flowing through the organism to develop. And the whole fantasy that magic like cosmic rays, for example, break genes... People have been looking at the effect of mutations on proteins now for a hundred years, and they've never created a better gene.

## Meaning and Society

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you had quoted David Bohm in one of your articles: "The being of matter is its meaning. The being of ourselves is meaning. The being of society is meaning. The mechanistic view has created a rather crude and gross meaning, which has created a crude and gross and confused society."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's an example of something that is so true that it's very funny.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think this whole idea that Western civilization is driving towards—that simply being is not enough, and that people are now restless and can't sit still—do you think there's a more nefarious purpose behind these political messages?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. You must do this, but you're only permitted to do what we say is meaningful.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with those studies from the 1960s that showed that doing altruistic work for others activates the neocortex and actually makes it grow? And doing stuff entirely for yourself only activates the lizard brain and actually shrinks the total brain volume?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't remember seeing those, but it sounds logical. That experiment you mentioned shows exactly that you need meaning to include everyone and ideally the whole ecosystem benefiting from your project.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the elite are motivated by some type of self-loathing type of situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think at an early stage in life, they swallowed and believed an image of themselves that someone told them. They're stuck in that mistaken image of what any organism is. Unless you see yourself as deeply involved in your project—that you're defining and discovering yourself in the process of what you're doing—you are stuck. That's part of what altruism does to the brain; your sense of self is based on this defining yourself constantly through experience and assimilating the viewpoints of others.

But if you're stuck on a model of what you are—usually with religious imagery—this imposed idea is going to say that your destiny is to serve that image and look for power and wealth so that that early implanted image survives.

## Trauma, Culture, and Control

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you noticed that some of the most pathological people tend to come from either religions or social practices that seem to involve self-mutilation or mutilation of very young people? Circumcision is probably the one that's the most commonly practiced.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. A guy at Oxford, J.D. Unwin, argued that civilization comes from repression, and sexual unhappiness drives the high creative societies. But what a "creative society" is, is one that makes war and conquers everyone around it.

A guy working at the National Institutes of Mental Health in the 1960s published an article in the *Journal of the Atomic Scientists* on body pleasure. He looked at detailed records of societies at all levels and found that all kinds of body mutilation—circumcision, lip expanding, earrings, tattoos—goes with hierarchy in the society. Women and children are under control and inferior in status. Enemies are basically to be killed or subordinated.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In regards to pleasure and freedom, do you think that may partially explain the fact that almost every culture around the world was found to dabble into either alcohol or psychedelics? And those that most often did that seemed to achieve pretty high levels of civilization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and they were not warlike. In Central America, the drug-using cultures were generally civilized by ordinary ideas of culture, but they had highly developed arts and weren't interested in conquering people.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Speaking of early childhood traumatizing experiences, do you think the current environment of "encouraging women" to dump their children into mass-scale childcare facilities at four to eight weeks has a similar effect of parental neglect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and that version of feminism was strongly promoted by the CIA through people like Gloria Steinem. Turning women into aggressive, competitive competition for men.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The version of feminism promoted in socialist societies was very different than the feminism I see being promoted here.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program. They basically said, "Oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you embrace our version of feminism." Become an aggressive, money-seeking male equivalent.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that the term toxic masculinity also has its roots in the CIA-driven culture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, machismo is one of these implanted ideas. It defines what you can become and how you should behave early as a child. That machismo implant is just one side of the CIA feminist implant.

## CIA and Cultural Manipulation

**Georgi Dinkov:** Was there ever a concern that the Soviets may be winning the war of the minds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. That was the motive for the Congress for Cultural Freedom. When they saw the real danger of the ideology of a more or less libertarian approach to self-determining individualism in the socialist countries, the CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom. They took money from the CIA—diverting it from the Marshall Plan—to create exhibitions of art, concerts, and journals of science, technology, economics, politics, and philosophy. It was a huge fountain of money going into a particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

## Medical History and Population Control

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think something like this may have happened with the contraceptive pill? Giving estrogen to women tends to masculinize them and really twist their behavior.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the concentration camps because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there anything published on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Barbara Seaman was the one that gathered up some of the information.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Because the initial contraceptives were pure estrogen, was this just to appease the Catholic Church because the Church was starting to wisen up on the idea that the estrogen pills were actually abortion pills?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it was a fact proven in the 1930s. My thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level creates abortions. It was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive with absolutely no evidence. That was just a sales point to shut the Church up.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what do you think about all the toxic masculinity, racism, and topics ramping up after Occupy Wall Street?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the control of Occupy Wall Street. The government allowed the industries to have snipers ready overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things got out of hand. The government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you noticed that whenever the powers that be feel threatened by a specific movement, they immediately start invoking these controlled opposition themes such as racism and feminism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Divide and conquer. You have people putting their attention on things that were mostly not issues in the socialist countries, but they made them issues specifically. And the transgender thing never would have taken off by itself, but it was promoted by government and industry as part of the distraction.

## Historical Assassinations

**Georgi Dinkov:** What was the distraction that was used when Kennedy or MLK was shot?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A discussion of whether it was Russia or Cuba that was responsible.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did it capture the public imagination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, no. Total capture. At first, there were only three or four skeptics publishing. The chairman of the Kennedy Commission was Allen Dulles—anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But everyone else was reading the newspapers and hearing how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union.

They were "sheep dipping"—creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim, he had this aura of Marxism around him. But he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right-winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the interviews of Kay Griggs? She describes all of these things in great detail. She talks about how the head of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, was killed in Africa.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## The Great Reset and Vaccines

**Georgi Dinkov:** So we should be living in better times these days because it looks like at least half the nation is greatly suspicious of the official story.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's part of the reason that the Great Reset is going so fast now, using the pandemic virus as a way to take information control. Half of the population is very disgusted with the Clinton/Obama type of government, wanting something radically different.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think at that point they may start getting the military involved regarding vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I just saw a video of a guy in a military uniform saying that with the emergency authorization of the FDA, the military is getting organized to vaccinate 100% of the population within 24 hours simultaneously.

**Danny Roddy:** These article titles are like they're from *The Onion*. "Vaccine safety to remain unclear until millions get their shots." Do you think they're preparing people that there's going to be side effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, the fact that they're starting with the minorities under the guise of fairness and equality... but they want the millions of minorities to be the ones to take the first testing risk.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the mRNA protein that the vaccine contains codes for the spike protein of the virus, don't you think there's a significant risk that in susceptible people this vaccine may actually lead to very serious side effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the spike protein causes inflammation by inactivating the enzyme that inactivates angiotensin. So the spike protein essentially turns on our inflammatory system. The RNA allows our own cells to manufacture the spike protein. So we are being prepared to manufacture the activator of our own inflammatory system.

We ignore the fact that we have reverse transcriptases that can turn RNA into DNA and integrate it into our genes so that we can pass on the ability to destroy our defenses against inflammation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is the onset of action of this potentially highly inflammatory response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on whether it's spreading by reverse transcriptase. It could happen within the first day or two. But if your body then increases the production of the spike protein, you could get cycles of inflammation coming and being overcome and recurring indefinitely.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If you look at the officially published side effects, they say the side effects of the vaccines are the same as COVID. So now they're going to administer the vaccine to elderly people, they're going to start dying, and then we're going to get told that, "Oh, no, it's not the vaccine that killed them. They contracted COVID."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's a nice development. The flu vaccine is well established as a destructive influence on the immune system, increasing your likelihood to contract non-influenza respiratory viruses. The immune system is damaged by every vaccination.

## Vaccine Mechanisms and Protection

**Danny Roddy:** The Rockefeller Foundation released some paper projecting a future scenario where they said the ideal situation was to get a vaccine every week.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the Chinese, when they identified the virus, found there were five versions of it already existing different places around the world. Naturally, a weekly vaccination would be an attempt to keep up with the mutation of the virus, but obviously insane.

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of Pfizer, a former vice president at Pfizer, Michael Yeadon, has a half-hour video that's very good. Just a very blunt description of how serious it is and how essential it is that "right thinking people stamp out this deadly hoax of a pandemic."

**Georgi Dinkov:** Speaking of protection from the vaccines, I've looked at some of the adjuvants and they seem to act by activating the endotoxin receptor, TLR4. And the tetracycline antibiotics are known to inhibit the synthesis of foreign RNA by the cell. So wouldn't something like a TLR4 blocker combined with a tetracycline antibiotic be a decent protection against mRNA vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To some extent, yeah. Azithromycin and the tetracyclines have very strong anti-inflammatory effects.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Which one do you think is more dangerous, the adjuvant or the mRNA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ingredients of the Pfizer vaccine suggest that it contains no adjuvant. It lists two lipids with a mysterious code number. But if you Google them, you find companies selling lipids that can be used as a solvent in vaccines, but the very same lipids are sold as adjuvants. So just by a double naming identity, they claim that their vaccine has no adjuvant.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is PUFA by itself an adjuvant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's the essence of the lipid adjuvant effect.

## Politics (Biden Era)

**Danny Roddy:** With our last conversation, you called Biden winning. What does this mean for the next 10 years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, it's almost all the same delusion that we've been suffering from for 50 or 100 years, that things are always getting better as power becomes more centralized. He's promised that Wall Street will like his program, and the people in charge of foreign policy and the Pentagon are the biggest warmongers in the country.

**Danny Roddy:** There was a Zero Hedge article titled "Joe Biden, the return of the CFR." And isn't the CFR intertwined closely with the CIA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, absolutely. He's never denied that. The people that were the warmongers from Obama's government went into business as industry representatives. The whole system is ready to pop into action immediately in January, establishing the Great Reset.

## Geopolitics and War

**Danny Roddy:** The World Economic Forum was talking about Cyber Polygon. They're cooking up future scenarios of cyber attacks and food shortages. Is there anything you think is more likely to happen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They really need to control the food industry and medical industry. Those are things that will make people do anything to get medical care and food.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If they're so consistently decimating the population all over the world, wouldn't that devalue the wealth that they have?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you have absolute control, then you can create only the wealth that you need and the "useless eaters" will get none of it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But how are they going to convince other competitors on the world stage, such as China or Russia, that this money has value?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, Libya was at the point of doing that, and that was quickly dispatched by killing Libya. And they know that Russia getting together with China is a deadly threat. And so World War III is their solution. There's no rational solution. If enough other countries get involved, the Great Reset can be stopped.

**Danny Roddy:** Something I didn't realize until a week ago was the technocratic slave grid made possible by collecting all this info is to develop the AI in an arms race with China. Is that the way you see it, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I think that's separate. They just hope to pour money into selected industries to develop more powerful digital surveillance. But that highly developed artificial intelligence then would be directed towards neutralizing China. Getting ahead of them not just for profitable industrial purposes, but getting ahead for things like inactivating their defense against rockets and airplanes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was reading an article saying that China's military program seems to be shifting resources towards developing electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a problem already met about 50 or 60 years ago. The US has been working to destroy defense systems for now several decades.

## Artificial Intelligence and Education

**Georgi Dinkov:** How much value do you assign to that whole concept of AI? Without consciousness, there can be no true intelligence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not at all. But it's a propaganda scheme for increasing the obedience of people. If you say that the algorithm will educate you and diagnose you, then you don't need intelligence anymore for any of these traditional human activities.

Right now they're practicing diagnosis by an entirely intended new baseless set of definitions. And so the artificial intelligence will be validated in terms of simply changing the rules and the definitions. If you control the definition of the outcome, you can make anything look good.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you noticed, especially at this point in the official mainstream media, they're saying that the flu season has mysteriously vanished in pretty much every country around the world?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, you can see that happening the first or second week of April. Suddenly there was no more influenza. It fell off a cliff. The same amount of hospitalization and death was taken over by COVID. Looking at the curve, you can see it's just a change of name.

**Georgi Dinkov:** When did the education in the U.S. start to become context-free and damaging people's minds to take everything on faith?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it accelerated after about 1960. In 1947, through government action, all Lamarckian teachers were fired in high school and colleges. Every field that impinged on one of the interests of the powers had to be removed from the schools.

## Health Questions: Temperature and Cancer

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A newsletter on temperature, the effects of body temperature on everything. People have been getting everything wrong. The rate of aging theory, for example—people were saying you should live slower and colder. And it led to kind of a fetish of cryotherapy, neglecting the harmful effects of lower body temperature, such as increasing anaphylaxis and allergy and chronic degenerative symptoms.

**Danny Roddy:** I recall from a previous conversation, you were saying the specific mitochondria or the respiratory enzymes are sensitive to temperature, but the whole thing just stops when the temperature declines, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the redox balance shifts towards inflammation as soon as your oxidation energy slows down.

**Danny Roddy:** Did you know even the American Cancer Society has a page of treating cancer with hyperthermic therapy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I knew someone that I quoted the Italian research on it—much higher success with prolonged hyperthermia just sitting in a hot box than all of the conventional treatments.

But the government approved two or three centers in the U.S. to test hyperthermic treatment, but they required mild radiation treatment with it. After a couple of sessions, a woman described that they had a heating pad on her abdomen, and she asked how they knew it was heating her body. They said it was controlled by computers. It was a total fraud. There was no attempt to have an internal thermometer to see if her body was really reaching a therapeutic temperature.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So do you think the fact that cancer patients often have bouts of fever, that's the body's attempt to essentially raise the temperature and treat itself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think that's what the various unorthodox treatments going back more than 100 years have done. They activated the fever system to get your temperature up to at least 40 degrees C.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So metabolic uncouplers such as dinitrophenol and aspirin—maybe part of their anti-cancer effects is precisely this raising the body temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, right. Aspirin does tremendously increase our respiration rate and heat production, but the medical world insists on classifying it as a fever breaker.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was reading articles on methylene blue also being an uncoupler in higher doses. And I know that back in the day, Szent-Györgyi, Broda Barnes, and Hans Selye noticed that cancer cells preferentially uptake methylene blue precisely because of their highly reductive metabolism. Wouldn't something like photodynamic therapy—shining red light on that area—be a decent protection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, if it's making the tumor blue, then that would absorb the red light.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I guess heating the entire body has other benefits, right? If the brain operates better at high temperature, a better operating brain can control the tumor growth too.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, as a chronic thing, I think the development of the tumor thrives on the inflammatory environment of a low brain temperature.

**Danny Roddy:** So all of these therapies that are promoted now online called cold thermogenesis is essentially asking for trouble?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** We have a few more donations... I'll send those straight to Ray. Ray, can you let people know how to subscribe to your newsletter and purchase your books?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. That's the address for both newsletter and books.

**Georgi Dinkov:** One last question from me. What's the status of the digitization project for your books?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know of any progress. It's partly intention, but it'll come along.

**Danny Roddy:** Amazing. Thank you so much, Ray. Thank you, Georgie. Have a safe weekend. Take care, everyone.
