## Introduction

**Kim Greenhouse:** Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to It's Rainmaking Time. This is Kim Greenhouse, and I have invited Raymond Peat, Ph.D., who has a background in biology from the University of Oregon and specializes in physiology. He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and in Mexico. He has written many papers on physiological chemistry and physics. His key idea is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

He is known for his views on progesterone, balancing female hormones, radiation, growth, cholesterol, natural estrogens, pregnenolone, and memory. He has written hundreds of articles and has very robust views on human health, including some that will defy common beliefs about fish oils, saturated fats, and bioidentical hormones. Welcome, Raymond Peat, to It's Rainmaking Time. You have been one of the big proponents early on of natural progesterone. Could you speak about your early findings regarding it?

## Progesterone, Estrogen, and Aging

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1968, I decided to go back to graduate school in biology. I had been working in linguistics, and I decided that to understand anything, it would help to understand how the brain works. But I found that the brain researchers were just as dogmatic as the people in linguistics. I found the least dogmatic area in biology was reproductive physiology and aging research because there were so few people getting big money to do it, so they were relatively free.

My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, had studied the effects of vitamin E on reproductive aging. I was going to specialize in how the oxidative process changes during aging and whether that affects reproductive efficiency. It turned out that it looked as if estrogen increased with aging, while progesterone decreased just about the time infertility sets in. That was contrary to all of the textbooks. But being an actual scientist, Soderwall said, "If it's repeatable, go ahead and do it."

In other areas of biology, if I observed something that seemed to violate the textbook description, the professor would just pretend he hadn't seen it because they were getting funding to develop a certain line of thinking. But since there was so little money put into reproduction and aging, actual science was allowed to go ahead. Other people working in the same lab eventually did the same kind of tests and found that in various situations, the tissues of other animals actually increased their estrogen content with aging.

Since progesterone is decreasing, and progesterone happens to be what inhibits the formation of estrogen inside cells all through the body, if you don't have very much progesterone, the estrogen goes on being synthesized. However, it can't escape from the cell into the bloodstream where it could be excreted. So, while the body is actually loading up inside the cells with estrogen during a progesterone deficiency, the blood shows a very low level of estrogen because it can't leave the cell. It needs things such as progesterone to loosen it from the binding proteins called receptors.

The estrogen excess causes a wasting of oxygen in the tissues that basically suffocates the embryo trying to implant and grow. This prevents pregnancy. That explains how the birth control pill works: it creates an excess of estrogen in the tissues, suffocating the fertilized egg. Stress, malnutrition, and various stressors that decrease your thyroid and progesterone production have that same effect as aging or taking an estrogen supplement. It leads to the progressive increase of estrogen inside cells, creating an oxygen deficiency which leads to a progressive loss of differentiated functions.

**Kim Greenhouse:** I imagine that during the time you were writing about this, when Dr. Lee came around, you got a lot of confirmation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I used to give talks to medical groups. There were organizations of orthomolecular doctors on the West Coast. I think it was the second time I talked to his group in the San Francisco area, I noticed one of the doctors actually seemed to wake up and pay attention, and that was John Lee. The others just couldn't hear anything that said estrogen wasn't the female hormone that decreases at menopause.

**Kim Greenhouse:** He got heavily attacked when he came out with what you were proposing. I think he front-ran it in the public domain, even though you were out there for years talking about it.

## DHEA and Hormone Balance

**Kim Greenhouse:** Regarding the orthomolecular and anti-aging focus—like the Life Extension Foundation—DHEA has been around forever. A lot of women are supplementing with progesterone and adding a little bit of DHEA. Even though DHEA can convert to testosterone and estrogen on low levels, women are using it. What do you think about it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a 1971 article, I mentioned DHEA as being one of the basic protective hormones like progesterone. Progesterone happens to be the main thing that protects against the conversion of DHEA into estrogen. Testosterone is really just as much a female hormone as a male hormone. Estrogen is somewhat more a male hormone; it is responsible for differentiating the male brain. So if I had to call it a gender hormone, I would say estrogen is probably more a male hormone.

**Kim Greenhouse:** How interesting. I don't think most of us would associate it with that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone is the real feminizing hormone. It protects against an excess of anything, including excess estrogen, testosterone, cortisone, or aldosterone. Progesterone makes up for a deficiency of any of those, but it also protects against a toxic excess of any of them.

**Kim Greenhouse:** So if someone is taking a low level of DHEA and progesterone, it's a nice combination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. As long as you're watching your general diet and thyroid function. It's possible to override the protective effect of progesterone if you eat a lot of unsaturated fat and not enough protein and calcium.

## Saturated vs. Unsaturated Fats

**Kim Greenhouse:** And unsaturated fat for the public would mean what? Corn oil, soy oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Corn oil, soy oil, canola, grapeseed oil—everything that is liquid has a lot of polyunsaturated fat. Olive oil, which will harden at refrigerator temperatures, still has about 10% polyunsaturated fats. I don't think a person should eat more than an average of a teaspoonful or two of olive oil per day. Butter and coconut oil are really the only very safe fats. Beef fat, lamb fat, butter, and coconut oil have only maybe 2% polyunsaturated fat. Macadamia is another one that has a moderate amount, but they still have several times as much unsaturated fat as coconut and butter.

**Kim Greenhouse:** You've been talking about the benefits of coconut oil way before Bruce Fife produced his books on the coconut oil miracle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1970s, I saw a study where groups of rats were put on lifetime diets of low fat, high fat, and medium fat. In the low-fat diet group, the fat was corn oil or some highly unsaturated oil. The high-fat animals were given either pure unsaturated fat, pure saturated fat, or blends. At the end of their life, their tissues were analyzed. The obese animals were the ones that had the high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fat. It wasn't at all the quantity of fat they ate. The low-fat eaters who got the corn oil were overweight with high body fat content. The high-fat eaters who had only the saturated fat were lean.

**Kim Greenhouse:** That is so interesting because so many people are learning about the benefit of saturated fats now, but it's taken years for this to come forward.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 90s, a millionaire in Nebraska started buying full-page newspaper ads saying that Oreo cookies and other traditional products were killing people because they had coconut oil in them. We had been using some very nice products, like tortilla chips fried in coconut oil. We ate huge amounts of those, and the more we ate, the leaner we got. After his national campaign against tropical saturated fats, all of these products disappeared. That really annoyed me, so I wrote an article in 1996 on coconut oil. I think that started a lot of the people selling it and talking about its benefits.

Most recently, coconut oil is being used to treat Alzheimer's patients. A woman is using MCT (medium-chain triglycerides), which are extracted from coconut oil, combined with coconut oil to make it less irritating to the intestine. A lot of people are getting good results. Previously, high saturated fat diets had been used to treat epilepsy, brain cancer, and degenerative liver diseases like hepatitis and cirrhosis.

**Kim Greenhouse:** My mom died in 2008 of Alzheimer's, and I wish I had put it together about the coconut oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My website has articles on Alzheimer's giving attention to the role of polyunsaturated fats in causing brain degeneration. There is another article that covers the role of polyunsaturated fats in scrapie or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease). I think polyunsaturated fats have a major role in all of the degenerative brain diseases, including Huntington's and Lou Gehrig's disease.

## The Myth of Essential Fatty Acids (Fish Oil & Flaxseed)

**Kim Greenhouse:** I know you have a very different view about taking flaxseed oil and DHA. In the anti-aging industry, it is heavily touted as brain food. Please share your perspective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way people reason is to identify fish oils (DHA and EPA) or the Omega-3 oils as "essential fatty acids," and then say since they are essential nutrients, they can't be toxic. Some of the articles on my website deal with that issue of essentiality.

The basic studies still being cited were done in 1929 by George Burr and his wife. At the time, they neglected to mention several well-known articles published in the same journal showing that those very fats the Burrs claimed were essential were actually life-shortening—that animals lived longer on a fat-free diet. One study showed a fat-free diet eliminated almost all cancers and slowed the aging process.

The Burrs ignored the contrary evidence and pronounced that linoleic and linolenic acid were essential to prevent a certain disease in rats—scaly tail disease. About 17 years later, Roger Williams' lab recognized the Burrs' rat disease as a Vitamin B6 deficiency. Vitamin B6 wasn't known at the time the Burrs were doing their study. Williams' lab gave the rats the exact same diet the Burrs used, created the deficiency symptoms, and then cured it with Vitamin B6 without adding any fats at all.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Did you know the FDA took B6 off the market so most people can't sell it individually anymore?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I didn't know that. But no one talks about the disproof of the Burr evidence. To bring the issue up to date, they cite babies and old people on intravenous feeding. At the time those studies were done, IV nutrition didn't include zinc, which has been known for 70 years to be essential. It wasn't added until the late 1970s. So again, they are confirming that deficiencies are created when you give a limited diet.

George Burr himself demonstrated that his fatty acid-deficient rats were burning fuel and consuming oxygen at a rate 50% higher than the rats on his "adequate" diet. He didn't understand that the fats were lowering the metabolic rate, drastically suppressing thyroid function so the rats could get along on fewer calories and vitamins.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What does that mean to us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you poison your thyroid gland, you don't need very many calories. They put women in closed wards and found that many overweight women were burning only 700 calories a day—about 35% as much fuel as they should. This means if you do anything to poison your thyroid function, you won't need as many calories or vitamins.

Polyunsaturated fats happen to be very general and effective blockers of thyroid function. A series of papers in French Annals of Endocrinology showed that thyroid secretion is inhibited by polyunsaturated fats. The transport proteins in the blood are blocked by these fats, and the more unsaturated, the more perfect the blocking. If the cell manages to receive thyroid hormone, the polyunsaturated fats block the cell's ability to respond to it. This leads to increased estrogen, decreased progesterone, and fat accumulation.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Why do they call flaxseed and fish oils "brain food"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you grind up someone's brain, you find it is full of chicken fat and fish oil-like stuff; it reflects exactly what we've been eating. Animals like pigs, chickens, and fish—who don't have a rumen to detoxify fats—will have tissues that reflect the composition of the fats they eat. The brain, being composed more of fat than any other substance, will have a high concentration of these unsaturated fats.

A group in France decided to measure fetal response to sounds. They found that the brain learning response was retarded in proportion to the mother's consumption of fish fat and highly unsaturated fats. After birth, the babies were underdeveloped, including the brain. This matched animal experiments from the 1970s: babies exposed to high prenatal unsaturated fats had smaller brains and didn't learn as well as those exposed to saturated fats.

Studies in the 1960s and 70s showed that sugar and progesterone are factors that increase brain growth. Zamenhof found that a chicken embryo's brain grew rapidly as long as glucose was present in the egg. When he injected extra glucose, the brains kept growing, and the chickens were born with uniquely large brains and were smarter than ordinary chickens.

**Kim Greenhouse:** So your final take is that essential fatty acids are not necessary and not useful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been asking people for about 40 years for the evidence of the essentiality of any of these fats. The only things ever mentioned are those odd few studies. You can grow cells in a culture dish in a completely fat-free mixture, and they divide and act like normal cells. It can't be essential for making membranes.

## Calcium, Gelatin, and Diet

**Kim Greenhouse:** I take it you have your coconut oil every day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not every day, but when I think of it. I try to keep my calcium intake high. Calcium and thyroid are closely connected. A hypothyroid person tends to have hyperactive parathyroid function, which dissolves the bones and puts calcium where it doesn't belong. Chronic low intake of calcium or low thyroid function will eventually make your bones weaker.

**Kim Greenhouse:** How do you get your calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk and cheese mostly. I average maybe a little over two quarts of milk a day with some cheese.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about gelatin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I advocate having a lot of gelatin if you are a meat eater. In the US, chickens are processed with a chlorine-based antiseptic foot bath, so chicken feet are often contaminated. If you buy tough, bony cuts—like lamb shoulder chops or oxtail—those are rich in gelatin. Gelatin only comes from animals. If you don't eat meat, milk, eggs, and cheese combined with fruits and vegetables can provide a balance of nutrients.

## Pregnenolone

**Kim Greenhouse:** Let's talk about pregnenolone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I accidentally discovered its value in 1984. I had been experimenting with progesterone and DHEA in vitamin E. I got very sick on a trip where I didn't have my vitamin E mixture. I took a pinch of plain pregnenolone powder, and in 30 or 40 minutes, all my symptoms disappeared.

I bought a kilogram to experiment with. I would take 3,000 or 4,000 milligrams at a time. It didn't feel different than 30 milligrams, but the main side effects were that it tightened up loose skin, made me look younger, and prevented migraine-like symptoms.

I gave it to a friend who was 82 and suffering from emphysema and oxygen starvation. I gave him an average of 500mg a day. Two weeks later, his skin color was normal, and he was walking around the city showing me projects, whereas before he could hardly stand up.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What does it do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It seems to cause waterlogged, swollen tissues to release the water causing the malfunction. Connective tissues tend to become inert and waterlogged when deprived of energy and under the influence of estrogen. Pregnenolone helps them contract and return to normal confirmation.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Can women on progesterone also take pregnenolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A large dose of progesterone is an anesthetic—it can sedate you. Pregnenolone doesn't have those anesthetic actions, so you can take it without that side effect.

**Kim Greenhouse:** It is also known for being good for the brain.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies during WWII showed that factory workers given pregnenolone produced more and coped better with boring work. I've seen depressed men become happy and productive within 15 minutes of taking it.

## Thyroid, Memory, and Dementia

**Kim Greenhouse:** Do you want to speak about memory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone and pregnenolone improve all mental functions, including memory. Estrogen excites the brain much like cocaine; overdosing causes seizures. Progesterone produces calmness.

Thyroid and progesterone work together to stabilize body temperature. Raising body temperature and available energy improves mental functioning. I've seen demented people become normal in days with thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone. One woman who had been epileptic and considered demented for 18 years became completely normal in five days with progesterone. She went back to graduate school and got straight A's.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Let's talk about T3, T4, and thyroid testing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The "Free T3" test corresponds fairly well to functions, but you have to look at the function itself. To interpret Free T3, you need to know the Reverse T3. I think the TSH is useful; a population with the lowest thyroid cancer had a TSH of 0.4 and below. Health improves when you lower TSH to that range.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about thyroid medication? Armour vs. synthetics like Cytomel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a woman in a coma who had been given increasing doses of T4 (thyroxine). She woke up when given intravenous T3. The brain keeps a 1-to-1 ratio of T4 to T3. If T4 gets too high, it can displace T3 and cause hypothyroid symptoms because T3 is the active hormone.

Cytomel (T3) is very fast-acting. If I can't remember a name, I chew a 5-microgram chip of Cytomel, and in minutes I remember. However, if you take a whole day's dose at once, it peaks and drops, potentially causing arrhythmia. Small doses throughout the day work better.

Armour Thyroid used to be the standard, but ownership changes led to processing changes, like removing calcitonin and adding binders that didn't dissolve well.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What do you suggest people take now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A mix of Cytomel and a thyroxine product works. A ratio of 4:1 or 2:1 (T4 to T3) is practical. For example, 40 micrograms of T4 and 10 micrograms of T3. Taking the T4 at bedtime helps hold down TSH.

## Coffee and Carbon Dioxide

**Kim Greenhouse:** Can we finish with a talk about coffee? We used to be told it was bad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A monograph around 1970 defined the safety and protective qualities of caffeine, including anti-cancer effects. Coffee provides about 20% of the vitamin and mineral intake in some diets. It is a concentrated source of niacin and magnesium. Studies find that people who drink the most coffee—more than five cups a day—have the least Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and thyroid cancer.

**Kim Greenhouse:** You also spend time in Mexico for the high altitude.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High altitude cures everything if you can get high enough. It relates to carbon dioxide (CO2). As oxygen gets thinner, CO2 is retained in your tissues. We are all being slightly oxygen-poisoned at sea level. Hospitals often harm patients by giving pure oxygen; it should have 5-7% carbon dioxide added.

Carbon dioxide therapy can cure mountain sickness. On Everest expeditions, breathing inside a bag provided CO2 therapy.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Is there anything else about the eyes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ultraviolet and blue light are damaging, especially if tissues are saturated with unsaturated fats. The blue light contributes to retinal damage.
