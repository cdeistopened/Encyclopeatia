## Introduction

**Kim Greenhouse:** Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to It's Rainmaking Time. This is Kim Greenhouse, and it is an extraordinary honor to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat, who is an expert in the area of naturopathic medicine, nutrition, and physiology. He has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon and specializes in physiology. He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana, the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, and Blake College.

He has written about anti-aging, the effects of hormones—including estrogen, progesterone, and DHEA—radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen. Recently, I found out he has written about water and some of the misunderstandings surrounding it. He has articles and papers on cancer, hot flashes, multiple sclerosis, and meat fats. He feels there needs to be a new perspective on living matter. If we actually had a different kind of perspective, we would understand that energy and structure are interdependent at every level. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the honorable and incredible Dr. Raymond Peat. Good afternoon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. If people want to get a perspective on what that means—a new attitude towards what life is—the works of Albert Szent-Györgyi and Gilbert Ling are the best places to start.

## A New Perspective on Living Matter

**Kim Greenhouse:** Let's create a context for the listeners about a new perspective on living matter. Flesh that out for us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It probably got its best start with a biochemist named Bungenberg de Jong. He demonstrated that compositions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate made things much more complex than colloids; he called them "complex coacervates." They had many of the functions of living cells.

A generation later, Sidney Fox demonstrated that he could create things like cells so simply that his students could create replicating cells that had many of the functions of bacteria in just an afternoon lab. He would throw amino acids on hot lava, imitating a prehistoric situation, and then splash a little water on them. He was creating them from a dry environment in which water was under the control of amino acids, rather than in a wet, ocean-like environment.

He showed that in this relatively dry condition, the water and the amino acids catalyzed themselves to form protein-like molecules which spontaneously formed little spheres about a micron in diameter. These were very uniform and would assimilate other proteins from the environment, grow, and bud like yeasts. They simply lacked nucleic acid to resemble living bacteria. When he added the precursors to DNA, these things would catalyze polymers of DNA-like material spontaneously. He showed that simply by not overwhelming the molecules with too much water, the water was an essential part of organizing proteins and DNA-like material.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What does that mean to us in the context of a new perspective on living matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at the substance of a cell, rather than having to be assembled through a billion years of evolution, it means that the principles governing the way we function also govern the way the organism holds itself together. Rather than a cell being isolated from the environment by a lipid membrane—the famous bilayer lipid membrane—the functional principle is what Bungenberg de Jong demonstrated: these complex mixtures of protein, fats, and carbohydrates spontaneously separate things from the environment.

For example, if you take a piece of hair made up of completely dead cells, wash it free of ions, and dip it into serum, it will pull out the potassium and bind it to itself against a gradient, excluding sodium. It will bind magnesium, excluding calcium. This demonstrates that you don't need membrane pumps. It's simply an ion exchange phenomenon that dead cells can do. Gilbert Ling and Bungenberg de Jong represent the real mainline of science, while the membrane school is the peripheral, irrelevant part, except they are more numerous.

**Kim Greenhouse:** So that's the big paradigm change in the way we understand the cell? There is so much said about hydration and needing to get through the membrane of the cell. Do you agree with that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I agree that is the paradigm, but it has been disproven many times. The idea of the membrane is that the arrangement of chemistry inside is unstable relative to the outside. This view is that we are a stable form of matter as long as energy runs through us. It is a chemically favored arrangement of matter that doesn't need pumps in the membrane to maintain it; it is simply the composition which maintains itself.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Is what you're saying that the cell is a self-maintaining organism versus needing things from the outside?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The whole idea of the membrane and the pumps is based on the idea that it's an improbable, accidentally arranged thing. The fact that Sidney Fox could make cell-like things in a couple of hours shows what a different perspective it is on the nature of substance.

## Hydration, Salt, and Edema

**Kim Greenhouse:** What is your view on cell hydration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gilbert Ling has demonstrated that the amount of energy the cell is producing regulates hydration. Energy prevents the cell from taking up too much water, but binds water and prevents its loss below a certain level. If you lose the adequate amount of energy, the cell loses control of the water. The water starts to take over and control the cell.

This explains many medical problems involving edema and swelling. The membrane theory is totally confused about this. Doctors will tell you to stop eating so much salt to reduce your edema, but in many situations, restricting sodium is exactly the wrong thing. It will make the edema worse, especially in premenstrual women and very old people. I've seen people solve their swelling problems, high blood pressure, and appetite control just by salting their food according to taste rather than what the doctor advises.

**Kim Greenhouse:** I have friends with high blood pressure, and I tell them to take real salt, but their doctors tell them not to have salt at all.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of doctors still tell people to drink two quarts of water, disregarding whether they might be drinking milk, coffee, or orange juice. Experiments show that if you put a little too much water in the intestine, it will promote inflammation. A little beyond that, and it can start causing a shock reaction.

Sodium stimulates energy production of the cell and respiration. If something interrupts that balance of salt, magnesium, and calcium, and the cell loses energy, the cell takes up too much water. The excess water stimulates cell growth, but not energy production. That tends to create an anabolic condition with possibilities including diabetes, obesity, cancer, and inflammation.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What do you think about the aquaporin channel discovery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gilbert Ling has written quite a bit about the channel idea. Since Ling explains the balance between proteins and water adequately to take care of everything, the channel idea is unnecessary. The channel idea goes with the concept of a membrane acting as a barrier to salt and water. But Ling demonstrated that there is no such barrier. As soon as isotopes became available in the 1940s, it was discovered that sodium freely leaves and enters the cell. There is no semi-permeable membrane keeping sodium out.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about keeping water out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same thing. One of the early critics of the lipid membrane idea commented that lecithin—which the membrane is supposedly made of—has a great affinity for water and will swell in its presence. It is a very bad choice for postulating as the limiting membrane barrier.

## Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Health

**Kim Greenhouse:** Would you talk a little bit about CO2? Since the EPA declared war on carbon dioxide, people are scared to death of it. However, I just realized that oxygen isn't everything. Explain what carbon dioxide is and what it has to do with aging and health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 60 years ago, researchers found that although some bacteria and protozoa can survive without oxygen, even those organisms cannot live without carbon dioxide. It really should be considered the basic material of life, not oxygen. The purpose of oxygen, from that point of view, is to make carbon dioxide.

If you consider Gilbert Ling's cell structure, the protein itself is a weak acid with a negative charge, which attracts positive ions like potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium. Carbon dioxide is one of the factors that cause our proteins to prefer potassium over sodium.

By having the right amount of carbon dioxide, the cell produces a steady stream of it flowing into the blood. As it leaves the mitochondrion, it reacts with water, forming carbonic acid. This carbonic acid has a negative charge, so as it flows out of the cell, it drags positive ions (calcium and sodium) with it. As we exhale, that carbonic acid in the blood changes back into carbon dioxide and leaves the lungs, leaving those calcium and sodium ions stranded in the blood. That accounts for the blood having a more alkaline pH than the inside of the cell.

One of the functions of carbon dioxide is to regulate the acidity of tissues, prevent the uptake of too much water, and keep energy intake going. Shock is a typical extreme situation in which cells become unable to make energy and take up too much water.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Can you elaborate on the relationship between CO2 and shock?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yandel Henderson, a Yale professor in the early 20th century, was one of the first to see that carbon dioxide relaxes the arterioles and allows blood to flow freely. If you turn off energy production and stop producing carbon dioxide, you have less relaxed blood vessels, and the heart has a harder job pumping. He showed that you could cause quicker recovery of oxygenation by adding 8% or 10% carbon dioxide to oxygen.

However, largely as a result of war research, the elimination of carbon dioxide metabolism became institutionalized. Hospitals simplified things by supplying pure oxygen in an emergency.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Do you agree that if we got more carbon dioxide in our systems, we would be healthier?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Up to a certain point. The insurance industry recognized more than 100 years ago that all degenerative diseases—cancer, brain diseases, heart disease—caused fewer deaths at altitudes of 8,000 to 10,000 feet.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Why do you think that is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yandel Henderson showed that oxidation of the tissues depends on carbon dioxide. If you have too much oxygen in your environment, as we do at sea level, it pushes too much carbon dioxide out of our blood. This shifts the balance so that red blood cells don't give up enough oxygen to the tissues. You will starve your peripheral tissues.

If you hyperventilate for a couple of minutes, you might notice your fingers and toes cramp. That same process happens under any circumstance that deprives you of carbon dioxide. Giving 100% oxygen will create the same situation. In the brain, too much oxygen and the deprivation of carbon dioxide shrinks the blood vessels. Imaging has shown that breathing too much oxygen lowers the availability of oxygen in the brain by constricting the blood vessels.

## Improving CO2 Levels

**Kim Greenhouse:** What would you suggest for listeners to get their carbon dioxide levels up? I noticed you mentioned the Buteyko breathing method.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Buteyko was a Russian doctor who noticed that sick and dying people tended to hyperventilate. He found that if he could calm them down and get them to breathe more slowly, they often recovered.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What else do you suggest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Diet is very important. Some foods interfere with metabolism and cause you to produce lactic acid, which displaces carbon dioxide. Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) block respiration and thyroid function.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about pH balance? It's very confusing for people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The function of oxygen is to make carbonic acid (CO2), which gives the healthy cell a mild acidic condition. As the CO2 drags minerals out of the cell and drops them in the blood, the blood becomes alkaline. To maintain that alkaline bloodstream, the kidneys should ideally be producing acidic urine. People with alkaline urine tend to deposit minerals.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What do you think about hyperbaric oxygen chambers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If circulation is destroyed, like in gangrene, high-pressure oxygen can keep tissue alive by diffusion. But in the brain, too much oxygen shuts down blood vessels. I knew someone treating cancer patients with high-pressure oxygen who tried adding carbon dioxide. One patient, who couldn't speak due to throat cancer, lost consciousness because of too much CO2. When he woke up, he was soaked in perspiration and the windows were steamed up. The carbon dioxide helped his cells excrete the water they had been holding. When he woke up, he could talk normally.

**Kim Greenhouse:** So, living at high altitude helps. What else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything that supports thyroid function, avoiding polyunsaturated fats, and avoiding electromagnetic fields. Estrogenic materials and estrogen pills stimulate hyperventilation.

## Hormones: Estrogen vs. Progesterone

**Kim Greenhouse:** Could you talk about the distinction between progesterone, pregnenolone, and estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen is essentially anti-thyroid. Thyroid is our basic oxygen-using hormone. Estrogen changes the way oxygen is used, diverting it from making carbon dioxide to fat metabolism, and stimulating the uptake of water. Estrogen causes the breasts and uterus to swell by taking water into the cell, which stimulates cell division.

**Kim Greenhouse:** I take it you are not into anti-aging bioidentical estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely not. The older and more stressed a tissue is, the more estrogen it tends to produce. A young, healthy person produces estrogen primarily in the ovaries. With stress and aging, every cell in the body develops the ability to make estrogen and loses the ability to excrete it. Simply by becoming deficient in progesterone, your blood test won't show that you are deficient in estrogen, because progesterone is needed to get the estrogen from the cell into the bloodstream.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What do you think of the fat cell relationship to estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** P.K. Siiteri was the first to demonstrate that fat becomes a major source of estrogen production after menopause. With stress, diabetes, and inflammation, the aromatase enzyme increases, producing more estrogen.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Doctors are giving women bioidentical estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone creams vaginally. What do you think about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Early studies showed that vaginal estrogen produces very immediate high levels all through the body because the membranes absorb it so easily. It increases the exposure of all cancer-sensitive organs. It has been known since the 1940s that all tissues will develop a risk of cancer with continuous exposure to estrogen. If you interrupt it regularly with progesterone, that reduces the carcinogenic effect.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about libido?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lowering the stress hormones, including estrogen, will very typically normalize libido.

**Kim Greenhouse:** So it's a whole system. You have to include the thyroid and nutrition.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the liver isn't supplied with adequate protein and B vitamins, your estrogen level will stay elevated. If you don't eat enough fiber, estrogen excreted into the intestine is reabsorbed. Eating a carrot every day can normalize hormones in a lot of people by preventing that reabsorption.

## Coffee and Coconut Oil

**Kim Greenhouse:** Let's talk about coffee. Weren't you one of the first to say coffee is good for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1970s, a monograph showed the cancer-protective effects of caffeine. Researchers found that adding caffeine to carcinogenic smoke reduced cancer rates in mice from 95% to 5%. It protected against radiation, viruses, and chemical carcinogens.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1970s, I read an article where they fed rats different diets. The leanest rats were the ones that ate the saturated coconut oil diet, regardless of whether it was high or low fat. The fat animals were the ones that had the pure polyunsaturated fat. The "saturation index"—the proportion of saturated fats to polyunsaturated in your tissues—is important. Cancer patients are very low on the saturation index.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Do you use refined or unrefined coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I use the refined, deodorized kind because a lot of people are allergic to the extraneous material in the unrefined oil.

## Thyroid Medications and Testing

**Kim Greenhouse:** Do you recommend Armour thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The original Armour product was stable for 90 years, but after the company was sold multiple times, the price went up and the formulation changed. I stopped using it in the early 90s because some people found the pills were going through undigested. I started using synthetic products like Cynoplus or Cytomel (Cynomel).

**Kim Greenhouse:** Why recommend a synthetic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Armour company invested a lot in research to ensure consistency. Smaller companies don't have those resources. Synthetics like Cynomel have been very consistent.

**Kim Greenhouse:** How should we test for thyroid? Blood or urine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The blood isn't a great test because hormones travel with proteins and fats. Broda Barnes advocated morning temperature as a very important indicator. Other indicators include cholesterol (high cholesterol often means low thyroid), carotene levels, and the speed of muscle relaxation (Achilles tendon reflex). Quick relaxation corresponds to good thyroid function.

## Serotonin

**Kim Greenhouse:** Is serotonin the "happy hormone"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The name means "serum tonic," or pressure increaser. It was identified in the 1950s as a cause of emotional disturbances and circulatory problems. 95% of the body's serotonin is made in the intestine. If the intestine is irritated, it produces excess serotonin. If the lungs and platelets don't destroy it, it gets to the brain and causes anxiety, aggression, and depression. It stimulates the adrenal stress reaction.

## Radiation

**Kim Greenhouse:** What is your take on mammograms and dental X-rays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** John Gofman, a former government spokesman, later showed that medical radiation was a major cause of breast cancer and heart disease. The incidence of these diseases corresponds to the availability of medical services. Radiation and estrogen synergize to increase cancer risk.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about airport scanners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low-energy radiation is more easily absorbed by tissues and is much more carcinogenic than high-energy radiation. The industry claims flying exposes you to radiation, but cosmic rays at high altitude are high-energy and pass through the body mostly harmlessly. At sea level, those rays collide with the atmosphere and release radioactive particles, so you actually get more harmful radiation at sea level.

## Pregnenolone, Sugar, and Orange Juice

**Kim Greenhouse:** Tell us about pregnenolone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pregnenolone is produced from cholesterol under the influence of thyroid and Vitamin A. It is the precursor to progesterone and DHEA. If you are deficient in thyroid, Vitamin A, or cholesterol, you will be deficient in pregnenolone. Pregnenolone inhibits the stress process and blocks the production of cortisol. It stabilizes cells.

**Kim Greenhouse:** How do you get enough pregnenolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By eating foods that keep my cholesterol production high. Orange juice is my main one. I've seen people raise their cholesterol to healthy levels just by drinking an extra quart of orange juice a day.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Won't the sugar cause a problem with glucose metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, you need sugar to make thyroid hormone and to regulate cholesterol. When sugar comes in the form of fruit like orange juice, the potassium takes on the function of insulin, so it is not fattening the way starch is. Starch is a powerful insulin stimulant, and insulin tends to turn carbohydrate to fat.

## Osteoporosis

**Kim Greenhouse:** How should we prevent osteoporosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** X-rays poison bone metabolism, so bone scans can contribute to osteoporosis. Ultrasound is many times more valid for checking bone density and actually stimulates bone strengthening.

**Kim Greenhouse:** What about thyroid and bones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies show that T3 (active thyroid hormone) stimulates bone cell metabolism, causing the production of carbon dioxide, which crystallizes with calcium to form new bone. Hypothyroid women often have more osteoporosis.

## Conclusion

**Kim Greenhouse:** What do you think of the Affordable Care Act?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'd rather pay the fine than be forced to buy insurance. I avoid doctors as much as possible.

**Kim Greenhouse:** Is there anything else you'd like to say to the audience?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Looking at the big context is the important thing. You are constantly subjected to misinformation. It is necessary to look at concrete experiments and see whether someone has done counter-experiments that would invalidate those.
