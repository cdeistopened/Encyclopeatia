## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Politics and Science is live today for a change. I'm very honored to have Dr. Raymond Peat back on the line. I'm going to use the same bio I had for you years ago, which is that you have a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. I also consider you a science historian and ombudsman. I've wanted to get you on again because you're interesting to hear on any subject, and we particularly have this weird emergency going on that has everybody spinning: the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to get your take on that, talk about the science behind pandemics and viruses, and maybe cover vaccines. What do you think is going on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First of all, I'm not sure anything special is going on in the virus and infection world. It's definitely happening in the media and politics. Mexico isn't getting excited; they've had, I think, 16 mild cases.

The CDC for years has been reporting the annual respiratory or flu-like death rate as being in the tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States—average deaths from respiratory disease being say 30,000 or 40,000. If you look at the historic percentage of those respiratory diseases, roughly 5% to 15% are historically coronavirus infections. The others are things as simple as rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus—things that range from mild sniffles up to serious pneumonia.

If 30,000 or 40,000 people are expected to die from flu-like respiratory disease, we would expect to have 3,000 or 4,000 deaths per year from a coronavirus respiratory infection. I don't see any evidence at all that anything is happening on the real biological level.

**John Barkhausen:** The official line is that the crisis actually hasn't happened yet. But you're saying in a given year we should still see 3,000 to 4,000 deaths from coronavirus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an average year that could still happen. We could get up to the average mortality associated with coronaviruses, but we're not approaching that by a long way so far. Just looking at the actual numbers, it looks like we're slightly deficient in cases and deaths of respiratory problems associated with that virus.

## Testing and Mortality Rates

**John Barkhausen:** Have you checked out the Chinese or the Asian data at this point? Are the corona deaths up from their average?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They haven't talked about the average for corona; they weren't gathering that data. But they say this is just slightly more deadly than a typical influenza virus.

The problem is Italy always has had about twice as many respiratory or flu-like deaths per year per capita as the United States, so it isn't unusual for them to be especially hard hit. What makes the number go up is that they have been primarily testing sick people in hospitals.

It's the same with cancer diagnosis. If you go all out to look for cancer in a population of middle age and old age, you'll find 100% cancers if you're really thorough. The more you diagnose, the more you can find people. People die at the same rate unless you treat them. If you increase your treatment for cancer as you increase the diagnosis, the treatment is going to kill more and more. But you can make your treatments look better by diagnosing more and more cases which are harmless.

Same with the flu or the coronavirus. If you test everyone in the population, you'll get all of these people with very mild reactions. In South Korea, for example, the mortality rate was 0.6% because they tested more people. The dying people become a smaller percentage when you test a more representative cross-section of the population.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's selection bias—because they're looking for the diseases in the most vulnerable, they test the sickest people first.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If restricted to the people in the hospital on respirators, you'll find that most of them have serious viruses, probably multiple respiratory viruses. When you're very sick, various viruses that have been carried harmlessly will pop to the surface and get measured because your immune system is compromised.

## Virus Mechanics and Physiology

**John Barkhausen:** Can we back up a little bit? What exactly is the difference between a virus and a bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost all bacteria are free-living in a sense. They can generally live outside of cells if you feed them the right stuff and give them the right temperature. They have the apparatus to reproduce their own genetic material.

The virus depends on entering a cell—either a bacterium or a higher organism's cell—and taking advantage of their machinery, like ribosomes that can produce proteins from nucleic acids. These viruses put in their nucleic acid once they get into the cell. That is processed on our ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum; proteins are added to the replicated nucleic acid, and then it's excreted as a finished particle by our ordinary cell secretory system.

**John Barkhausen:** In a healthy person, if you encounter a new virus, do you think we're able to conquer that or isolate it so it doesn't do any harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For example, the air sacs in our lungs are lined with epithelial cells. There are cells around the air sac that secrete mucus to cover the epithelial cells. To reduce the surface tension so that the air sac will stay open, there is a protein called surfactant protein. It has an oily, lipophilic fraction, so it acts like a soap. The water-loving part of the protein dissolves in this mucous layer, and the oily surface reduces the surface tension so the air sac can stay open without extreme tension.

That surfactant protein contains groups that will collect the sugar-like surfaces of viral proteins. Any pathogen that hits that surfactant protein will get glued down by these binding particles. It's our first layer of defense.

## The Role of ACE2 and Inflammation

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In and around the epithelial layer, we have reactive parts of the immune system. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of the early parts of our immune system. If a pathogen gets through, you activate this proteolytic protein that creates angiotensin, which is like a transmitter of a panic reaction to the organism.

It happens that this coronavirus is able to bind to one of these angiotensin-converting enzymes. There is one which is only pro-inflammatory (ACE1), and another one that backs that up and inhibits the inflammatory damage done by the first one. This is called ACE2.

ACE2 happens to be attacked by this particular virus. Binding to ACE2 means that it leaves ACE1—which produces angiotensin—free to act. ACE2 is capable of inactivating angiotensin, breaking it down to the first seven amino acids (angiotensin 1-7), which is a defensive, anti-inflammatory peptide. So if your ACE2 is knocked out, angiotensin has a free range to cause damage.

The virus increases the inflammatory reaction by sticking to this defensive enzyme. That enzyme combined with the virus then acts to enter the cell by way of the angiotensin receptor, which is called the AT1. That turns on a whole range of destructive processes—nitric oxide and serotonin, for example.

**John Barkhausen:** So nitric oxide and serotonin are inflammatory mediators?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. So anti-inflammatory things are the known treatment for this kind of virus. The Chinese for years have been using Cinanserin, which is a serotonin blocker. They find that it's helpful for people with the established respiratory corona infection. Losartan, which is a high blood pressure drug, is the most well-known blocker of the angiotensin 1 receptor.

**John Barkhausen:** How do you spell those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cinanserin is C-I-N-A-N-S-E-R-I-N. Losartan is L-O-S-A-R-T-A-N.

**John Barkhausen:** Basically, the virus just activates an inflammatory process that many other things activate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. Things that primarily activate nitric oxide production, serotonin, histamine, or prostaglandin production tend to end up in the same condition. Without knowing more about the nature of the infection, I think people who are taking aspirin, for example, are protected. Aspirin has a wide range of antiviral properties. It's already known to reduce infection from the standard influenza virus, hepatitis C, and rhinovirus.

Much maligned Vitamin D happens to have effects like progesterone and aspirin: all of our known protective, pro-immune but anti-inflammatory substances lower the expression of angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1), so they predispose us to be less inflammable.

## Transmission and Hygiene

**John Barkhausen:** When it enters your lungs, your cells put out a lipid of some kind?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once we're born and start breathing, we depend on the production of this surfactant protein. It's everywhere normally. Our intestines have similar layers of defenses. Coronaviruses don't just specialize on the lungs; they can infect the mucous membranes in the nose and the intestine.

Some people have said that runny noses aren't connected as a precursor of the lung infection, but a Russian virologist looking at tens of thousands of patients saw that a runny nose was a typical precursor to the lung infection symptoms. The intestine is just as prone to infection as the lungs.

**John Barkhausen:** So eating something could make you sick? Even though your stomach acid would take care of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you get it in your mouth and swallow it, it could infect those tissues. The stomach acid doesn't necessarily break down the nucleic acid.

**John Barkhausen:** They're telling us to wash our hands all the time. How does soap kill a virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It dissolves the proteins, making relatively insoluble things soluble. The soap has a hydrophobic fraction that sticks to hydrophobic insoluble parts of an organism and disassembles it from the inside out.

**John Barkhausen:** Is COVID-19 better at breaking into our system than a normal cold? I've heard a cold is also a coronavirus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A cold can be caused by any of these if your immune system is weak. One study found that for almost half of all respiratory infections, they couldn't identify a particular cause. Rhinovirus was the biggest at about 30%. The coronavirus is in the range of 5% to 15% of those respiratory infections.

## Politics, Vaccines, and Lab Theories

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think the reaction of the government at this point is over the top?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Unless it was their purpose to create international chaos—for example, to try to finish off Iran by cutting off their medical supplies while they're having a crisis. If it's not really a threat otherwise, it becomes a threat when you do all of these insane things.

The media, including big science media like *Nature* and *Science Magazine*, are getting excited in denying that it was an intentionally created virus leaked from a lab. They just published a paper explaining technically why it would be impossible, but the fact that they're rushing so fast to deny it is suspicious.

Normally they say it takes over a year to produce a vaccine to a new respiratory infection, but they're already saying they have a vaccine ready to test. The purpose of the CDC patenting the coronavirus 17 years ago was deliberately to create pathogens experimentally to enable them to anticipate pathogens so they could have a vaccine ready.

**John Barkhausen:** Why would the CDC patent that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So they can license a vaccine, I suppose.

**John Barkhausen:** Dr. Fauci was saying it would be at least a year and a half minimum to put out a vaccine. Do you think he's out of the loop?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that's what virologists in general say. It takes time to develop it and do actual testing. I think that's a very optimistic idea because if they really had to test it for safety, it would take a generation.

**John Barkhausen:** Because they test on animals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way they have tested the safety is fraudulent. In the control group, they use the same adjuvant—aluminum adjuvant, for example—which is the most dangerous component. You can't have a test without a proper control group.

**John Barkhausen:** Explain what an adjuvant is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It creates derangement. In this case, the muscle is where they inject it. They found that just pathogen particles weren't enough to really tear up the tissue to produce a violent immune reaction. So they found that aluminum oxide particles created a terrific immunological storm. That extreme inflammation at the point of injection activates a systemic immune reaction. It turns your whole body into an inflammatory system. That's why people often have a fever for a couple of days after getting a shot.

## Historical Context: Spanish Flu and EMF

**John Barkhausen:** They keep harking back to the Spanish Flu of 1918. I read recently that the flu might have been caused by a vaccine the Rockefeller Center was testing on soldiers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't heard that specifically, but do you know about the movie *Vaxxed*? There's information in that about the Gulf War Syndrome and the anthrax vaccine. People were getting Gulf War Syndrome without leaving the US following their anthrax vaccination.

**John Barkhausen:** I found an article looking at research on the Spanish Flu. The scientist who looked back at the autopsies found they all tested positive for bacterial pneumonia.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. The CDC counts pretty much anything that falls into the unknown category of severe respiratory syndromes as flu to get their annual 40,000 or 50,000 deaths so they can scare people into getting flu shots. It obviously isn't the flu; it's pneumonia from partly unknown causes and partly a variety of viruses.

Also, stress itself is the cause of epidemics. Shortage of food will increase the incidence of infectious diseases. If anything unusual is happening in the disease world now, I think you can blame sanctions as one of the big causes. It's dislocating the world economy. If you cause unemployment, you're going to increase infectious diseases.

**John Barkhausen:** Some people are speculating that the hot points for this viral infection coincide with sites of 5G deployment. Do you think that could contribute to a declining immune system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a good lecture by Devra Davis. She did a good analysis of the electromagnetic damage. They claim it's safe on the basis of absolutely no research, but the animal research that exists shows there is a real danger. Some studies found that people who had worked on an electric sewing machine for 20 years had a very high rate of dementia. Anything that affects your nervous system is affecting your immune system.

## Listener Questions

**John Barkhausen:** Caleb from Ontario asks: How much of a role does endotoxin play in regards to a viral infection, and are the effects of endotoxin increased in the presence of a virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Endotoxin is a fatty acid with carbohydrate attached to it—lipopolysaccharide. It's part of the coating of a bacterium. Normally our intestine filters out most of it, and the liver detoxifies it. But when you're under stress, your liver gets overwhelmed, letting it produce inflammation and interfere with mitochondrial energy production.

It activates the angiotensin system. So, a viral infection and anything stressing your intestine enough to make it permeable to bacterial materials will end up in the same place: causing inflammatory symptoms.

**John Barkhausen:** It's always amazed me how connected the intestine is to other organs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's partly chemical leaking through and partly inflammatory substances like serotonin and histamine produced by the intestine itself. A tremendous flood of serotonin circulates in the platelets, and the nerves can transmit signals—such as secretion of mucus—right up to your nose and throat.

That's why I recommend raw carrot. Because carrot is indigestible, it helps wash out some of the bacteria producing the endotoxin. If you take anti-inflammatory things with it, such as olive oil, coconut oil, aspirin, or an antibiotic, the carrot will deliver that through your intestine.

An early 20th-century gastro doctor demonstrated that in canine distemper—thought of as a respiratory disease—there was already a well-established infection in the intestine before any virus occurred in the respiratory membranes. They would start drooling and sniffling because of a signal from an inflamed intestine.

**John Barkhausen:** Another question: What about the theory that viruses are simply phages or somatids from bacteria, and viral infections are really caused by occult intracellular bacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those things do exist, but I don't think that explains it all. We are loaded with potential viruses. Several percent of our genome is identified as potential viruses or retroviruses. This is DNA that has been built into our system by exposure to the environment.

Barbara McClintock showed that stress causes genes to come out of the chromosomes and move around. Since we have these retroviruses, it's almost certain that under stress we will express retroviruses that have been in us for generations. If you look for them, it looks like you have caught a viral infection from the outside.

**John Barkhausen:** One last question: "I heard that immunity after an infection with a coronavirus is quite short-lived."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't have an opinion on acquired immunity, but one thing that is known is that after this kind of severe respiratory infection, there is a great increase in the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Inflammation leads to fibrosis and reduced lung function. I think the real thing to worry about is stopping the progression of that angiotensin-related inflammatory production of tissue fibrosis.

**John Barkhausen:** And anti-inflammatories will do that. What's the best way of delivering an anti-inflammatory to the lung?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Through the mouth. Just eating it. Losartan, Cinanserin, or Cyproheptadine are good, safe, broad anti-inflammatories.

A lot of people are recommending the old approach to viruses: killing the virus using nucleoside analogs to mutate the DNA of the virus. But studies show these definitely injure the gonads and mutate human DNA. Widespread use of that is going to create genetic damage to the reproducing population.

## Summary and Recommendations

**John Barkhausen:** We're running out of time. What's the best course of action for people to protect themselves?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My first recommendation is to eat well and make sure your Vitamin D level is up to around 50-60 ng/mL on a blood test, which often takes 5,000 units a day. Use a very safe antiviral such as aspirin.

If there's a sign of an infection, then I think Losartan and the anti-serotonin things (Cinanserin or Cyproheptadine) would be appropriate to limit the degree of inflammation. Don't worry about killing the virus or becoming immune to some future variant.

**John Barkhausen:** And you can get Vitamin D from sunlight if it's sunny enough.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the best thing.

**John Barkhausen:** Thanks for being on the air tonight, Ray. I really appreciate it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, anytime.
