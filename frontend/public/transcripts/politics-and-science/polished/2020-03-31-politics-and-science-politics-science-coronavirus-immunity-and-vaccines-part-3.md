## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Welcome to Politics and Science. This week we're having Ray Peat, physiologist and science historian from Eugene, Oregon, back on the show. We're going to be talking about the unfolding coronavirus crisis here in the United States and around the world. This was recorded on March 31, 2020. Ray has a PhD from the University of Oregon and specialized in physiology and hormones. Is that correct, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. Interrelated reproductive hormones.

**John Barkhausen:** We've been having a conversation the past few weeks about the ongoing coronavirus so-called pandemic that has swept the globe and is scaring everybody, especially in the United States where the news reporting is particularly sensational. Do you watch mainstream news, Ray? I don't usually, but I've been checking it out lately. It's just plain scary, talking about bodies piling up in the backs of trucks in New York City. But today we're going to talk about the actual data. They've been predicting huge numbers of mortalities. Do you see that yet, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't seen any numbers that convince me that anything unusual is happening regarding virus mortality.

**John Barkhausen:** Can I ask you, where do you go for data?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Google mostly, and somewhat on PubMed. When something on Google isn't available, I often find backup material on PubMed.

## Flu Statistics and CDC Reporting

**John Barkhausen:** Give us what a normal flu year would bring and where we are now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A little over a year ago, the CDC announced that the 2017-18 flu year had killed at least 80,000 people. But then several months later, they revised it down to a little over 60,000. It's interesting because it shows how wildly approximate their estimates of the deaths are. They say that the average has been a little over 40,000 for the last 10 years or so.

I just saw an article on HuffPost from 2014 by Lawrence Solomon, quoting CDC people in 2004 saying that they had contact from the vaccine industry worrying about their weak sales. They decided to rouse the public by convincing them that something dangerous was happening and that they should get vaccinated. That follows long after the 1976 swine flu fiasco, where they supposedly had a pandemic but only one person died in the U.S.

In this program they started in 2004, the goal was to get media excitement going on the number of flu deaths. The verified, actual immunological evidence from people dying of respiratory diseases showed very few documented cases of flu, just because they weren't doing many tests. Despite that, the national statistics based on death certificates showed several hundred people recorded as dying of influenza. With those very small numbers, they didn't have a good case for mass vaccinations. So, they started including pneumonia deaths with influenza. They called it "influenza-like diseases." That's how they managed to get up in the tens of thousands of deaths every flu season.

**John Barkhausen:** So they started including a broader category of illnesses and put it under the heading of flu.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that way they could get approximately 10% of everyone dying. 6% on the average year was closer to everyone dying during the four months of the flu season. The old people, that's probably just about the normal proportion of very old people dying. They'll get respiratory problems. Their breathing and circulation are failing, so the lungs fail to work and accumulate water. They can put down pneumonia as the cause of death, or respiratory problems.

When the lungs are slowing down from old age and circulatory diseases, the flow of mucus—which normally runs up the tubes to the mouth to be swallowed—slows down. The bacteria that are always falling into the bronchial tubes from the air stay in place longer just because the cilia aren't sweeping them out quickly. As you're dying from heart failure, liver failure, and lung failure, the mucus allows bacteria to accumulate. You'll very likely have a superimposed bacterial infection on top of whatever is happening. A viral infection also slows the cilia movement and lets the mucus and aerial bacteria accumulate. So a typical viral infection also ends up with a bacterial infection. The bacteria can cause all kinds of damage and are pretty sure to kill a person off if they aren't getting antibiotics. But that doesn't mean that the bacteria was the cause of the infection.

**John Barkhausen:** So basically their body was shutting down to begin with, and that's why they got infected. With the new, improved statistics, where they went from several hundred people actually dying of the flu to 40,000 to 60,000 per year, how many have actually died officially of coronavirus? Where do we stand today on the 31st of March?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was probably yesterday that I looked at it, and it was about 2,400 at that time. In just a day, it had just about doubled. So it was going up fast. But since about 10% of the people dying of flu are expected to have the coronavirus, you have to look at the samples. When they were doing samples of people with respiratory diseases, they would see about half the people had no identifiable cause. Then the rhinovirus would be maybe 30%, the flu virus maybe 15%, and the coronavirus maybe another 15%.

Just on the basis of samples from previous years, you would expect maybe 10% of the dead people to have an identifiable coronavirus in them. If 45,000 people are expected to die, then 10% of those would be 4,500 expected dead people containing the coronavirus—not that it killed them, but that it was identifiably present as they were sick with respiratory disease.

## Testing Bias and Pandemic Preparedness

**John Barkhausen:** They actually got tested of all the people who die of the flu, and they say 50% of those are of unknown flu causes. Does that mean they haven't tested them or they just can't identify the strain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Couldn't identify. It could have been bacteria or just simple heart disease.

**John Barkhausen:** So what you're saying is that people are dying, they're testing them for coronavirus, which they come up positive, but it's not necessarily what killed them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** True. If you have a limited number of tests and you use them mostly in hospitals on sick people coming in, you're going to have a very high percentage of the tests showing positive just because of that known figure from previous years that 10% of respiratory infections averaged coronavirus. Therefore, of the people who die, there is also going to be a very high percentage because you're testing primarily the sick people.

As you go out into a broader part of the population and start testing healthy people, the mortality rate per infection shrinks. That happened in China; it went from something like 3.5% or 4% down to around 1%. South Korea had a very big testing program, and they had only a 0.6% to 1% mortality. I don't know if that's the situation in New York, Spain, and Italy, where they're having a high percentage of mortality, but you can't know at all what the numbers mean unless you know who they're picking out to test.

**John Barkhausen:** It seems we're operating on the assumption that it is fatal right out of the box.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It looks very much as if they were inclined towards that presumption by the fact that the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation, and Johns Hopkins University organized this pretend pandemic in October of last year. They looked at what to do and how to prepare the government and hospitals to respond if a deadly coronavirus were imported and threatened to kill tens of millions of people. They had this in everyone's consciousness. They invited people who were in influential positions politically and economically around the world and had them run through this program in October. So everyone had this implanted fear. At the first meaningless numbers, I think people jumped to the fear that this was that imaginary virus they had proposed.

**John Barkhausen:** So basically, they had a dry run for this back in October. What is the Gates Foundation's relationship to the World Health Organization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The foundation is pouring a lot of money into reorganizing the world. For example, African agricultural programs. I read that compared to the United Kingdom's donations to that United Nations Fund, the Gates Foundation was giving 14 times as much money as the whole United Kingdom. They're pouring money into changing the economy, focusing on Africa, privatizing the economy, farming, and the health care system.

**John Barkhausen:** I did read something about the WHO never used to take money from private persons or organizations before, but now they are. Does that mean that basically they're open to funding from the pharmaceuticals as well as NGOs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think the pharmaceuticals are probably the biggest source of money.

## Vaccines and Innate Immunity

**John Barkhausen:** Do you have any specific worries about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drug companies would be happy if everyone took a flu vaccine. But the trouble is, the flu vaccines contain multiple antigens besides influenza. Or if they get a coronavirus antigen, they contain adjuvants and junk antigens, such as the cells they were using in their culture process. So it's a very complex and highly inflammatory material that they use just to promote the immune reaction.

The trouble is that the viruses mutate so quickly. After one, two, or three years, they are very likely to have disappeared and might never come back. But it takes a year and a half or two, typically, to make a vaccine. In 1975 and 1976, the CDC's man in charge of overseeing flu vaccines kept telling his bosses that it was futile to try to get a vaccine in time to catch these rapidly mutating viruses. They ignored him and went on with the program. Finally, he went on television and got fired for it. But he exposed the basically fraudulent idea that you could have an effective and harmless flu vaccine.

**John Barkhausen:** Is there any way to judge the efficacy of a flu shot?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They aim to get an antibody produced in first the animals and then the people. The trouble is that the antibodies have some generality and overlap, but they are fairly specific for a particular strain. So they're not much good for the next strain that comes in around the time that the flu vaccine becomes available.

The real part of the immune system—which is really prior to the vaccines and is, I think, a more important part—is the so-called innate immune system. It has been known for at least 20 or 30 years to be trainable or educable, the same way the adaptive antibody system is. The fundamental whole-body processes that catch viruses in many ways and reduce the harm they do just aren't attended to. The vaccine companies can demonstrate that they're producing antibodies, but they can't clearly show what's happening in the innate system because it involves changes in the whole body. This starts with, for example, the surfactant protein in the air sacs of the lungs, the nature of the composition of the mucus, and the surface of the cells.

**John Barkhausen:** And those are all surfaces where a surfactant is supposed to be present to protect you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Healthy mucus is a very powerful protector, especially if the mucus is being swept constantly out of your lungs. Once in the cell, there are many layers of other innate protectors. Since the coronavirus in particular is known to activate all of the inflammatory processes—including tending to stop the flow of mucus out of your tubes and changing the circulatory pattern, releasing histamine, serotonin, angiotensin—everything that is harmful is activated by these infectious things.

## Medical Risks and Hospital Protocols

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe we could talk about how, as a country, we can move forward and approach this problem rationally.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's the important thing, because they're deliberately getting people scared so that they will be ready to get vaccinated next season. Our whole generation, going back at least 50 years, has been heavily indoctrinated to go to the doctor. People are trained to think of the medical profession as protective, but there's really no objective evidence that that protects against anything.

In fact, when you look at the studies that try to be objective, there are two publications I know that looked at hospital deaths alone. One group said at least 220,000 deaths are caused by accidents caused by the medical staff. Another group said 440,000 deaths per year are caused by medical mistakes. Those numbers already put deaths caused by medical mistakes in third place behind heart disease and cancer deaths. And that wasn't including hospital-acquired infections, which amount to around 100,000 deaths per year.

Since there's nothing safe and effective against the virus, people are going into the hospitals with very little examination and they are putting them on ventilators. One of the common practices when people come in with respiratory infections, even before they go on a ventilator, is to give them aerosolized antivirals such as ribavirin, even though there's no published evidence showing that reduces mortality. Since they know it works in vitro—it'll reduce the virus in cells in a culture dish—but there's no proven evidence that it protects the person against the virus in the living state.

**John Barkhausen:** Is this antivirals you mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Hydroxychloroquine is classified as an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory for rheumatoid arthritis. But these nucleoside analogs or the hydroxychloroquine categories are all recognized as hazardous, mutagenic, possibly carcinogenic drugs. They damage the RNA or DNA of the virus, but they also damage the human DNA and RNA.

The ventilation itself, if they have to stick a tube down your windpipe, tends to activate inflammation just by the mechanical damage it does. They are typically using 40% to 60% oxygen supplement. Sometimes it's just air, but if you speed the respiration with just ordinary air, and especially if you double or triple the amount of oxygen, you're necessarily going to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in their lungs and bloodstream. Carbon dioxide is a major anti-inflammatory defense against the damage that the viruses are doing. Scientifically, there's a lot of evidence to show that what they're doing very quickly when someone gets to the hospital panicked over the coronavirus is very, very dangerous.

**John Barkhausen:** If you do have some respiratory problem and you're having trouble getting enough oxygen, it seems like that would naturally increase your CO2 as a response to that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they would more generally use Carbogen, which is 5% carbon dioxide added to oxygen, that will give you more oxygen actually than just hyperventilating a person. The carbon dioxide is anti-inflammatory and has many pro-respiratory effects. It helps to deliver the oxygen, moving it from the blood into the energy-producing cells. And it opens up capillaries that have been constricted by such things as angiotensin produced by infection.

**John Barkhausen:** So if you wanted to instruct somebody how to do it, you'd say if you had to do the ventilator, you'd do 35% oxygen and 5% CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think even 1% CO2 would be a big help.

## Masks and Anti-Inflammatories

**John Barkhausen:** I was wondering, do masks increase your CO2 levels? I feel like it's like breathing into a bag.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not very much. The carbon dioxide doesn't stay in place.

**John Barkhausen:** That brings me to the subject of anti-inflammatories. I heard a show with an English doctor named John Campbell. He concluded that there's a reason we get a fever and it's important, especially with coronavirus. He quoted some French medical ministers saying that with the fever of coronavirus, it can cause a lot of negative complications if you use anti-inflammatories of any kind. What is your opinion about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw that, but I also saw his video on vitamin D. The vitamin D talk is very good, and what vitamin D is doing is profoundly anti-inflammatory. But he recommends vitamin D, aspirin, vitamin B1, and progesterone. Their benefit is in this situation largely by lowering the angiotensin receptor, a very central basic thing in anti-inflammatory protection. So vitamin D is one of our central anti-inflammatory things and very protective against all kinds of viral infections.

**John Barkhausen:** Going back to John Campbell talking about fever being important and not getting in the way of the fever's work to kill off the coronavirus, do you feel like aspirin would interfere with the fever?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin can often increase your thyroid function and cell respiration so much that it doesn't affect your fever, but it can lower the *need* for a fever. Since angiotensin overproduction is a basic harm factor of any infection, you're stopping the mechanism of the harm. That is what is lowering the fever. It isn't just mechanically turning off heat production. It actually increases oxidative metabolism and, at least temporarily, will increase thyroid function. So when it reduces a fever, I think it's most often because it's remedying the thing that is causing the fever.

**John Barkhausen:** Does the fever actually kill the virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It activates various parts of your immune reaction. The ability to produce antibodies, for example, is increased with fever. And white blood cells can eat faster at a higher temperature. So in general, your resistance is increased with the fever.

**John Barkhausen:** Is there anything we didn't cover that you wanted to?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of places are warning about anti-inflammatory drugs. They're extending it to aspirin. They're generally getting confused, thinking that the ACE2 enzyme—which is the target of the coronavirus—shouldn't be increased because it would increase the chance of catching the coronavirus. There was an article in *The Lancet* that said basically the same thing: stop taking anti-inflammatories because they'll increase your ACE2 enzyme and make a bigger target. But there had already been half a dozen very clear papers saying that the virus *decreases* your ACE2 enzyme, increasing the pro-inflammatory angiotensin production. So what you need to do is get your ACE2 back in production to destroy the inflammatory mediator.

## Lockdown Policy and Health Tips

**John Barkhausen:** I was reading an opinion piece by Scott Atlas working off the epidemiological analysis by Dr. John Ioannidis. He was saying it doesn't make much sense to lock everybody up forever. He thought it would make much more sense to only try to isolate those who are most vulnerable and let the rest of the population build up immunity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's very reasonable. Sweden has basically done nothing resembling the United States program. The government there so far has told old people and sick people to stay home, and everyone to wash their hands and basically just behave sensibly, not shutting down businesses.

**John Barkhausen:** Just to sum up, Ray, if you wouldn't mind going over again all the things one can do to keep themselves healthy and keep an innate immune system working. Sleep would be one of those, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And a good diet is necessary for sleep. Vitamin D and the associated calcium work together. Vitamin D is anti-inflammatory, but it works by lowering parathyroid hormone. It can't do that if your phosphate intake is very high relative to calcium. So cutting down on your beans, nuts, meat, and fish, and increasing cooked green leaves, cheese, and milk will improve the function of the anti-inflammatory, anti-infective vitamin D, lowering the parathyroid hormone and all of the associated pro-inflammatory things that it does.

**John Barkhausen:** Well, that sounds good. Let's see if we can work on that. Dr. Raymond Peat, thanks so much for being on the show today and I really appreciate getting your analysis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Thanks.
