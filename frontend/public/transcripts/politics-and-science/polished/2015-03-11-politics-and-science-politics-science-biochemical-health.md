## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Today we're going to be talking about human health and the physiological implications of some of the chemical processes that happen in the body, namely reduction and oxidation. My guest today is Dr. Raymond Peat. He has a PhD in biology and a specialty in physiology. Ray, do you want to add anything to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was studying for my degree at the University of Oregon, I got interested in oxidative processes as they relate to aging. I've been thinking about what oxidation means and all the ramifications for 40 or 50 years, and I am still curious about how it really works.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's an ongoing scientific endeavor, understanding it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Electrons moving around in matter is one of my longest standing interests. I think it started when I was a little kid, but I'm still not satisfied that anyone knows what an electron is or how it works. Without knowing that, you really don't understand what's going on in oxidation, reduction, physical free radicals, and so on.

## The History of Biochemistry and Science

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe you could give us a sense of the history of people trying to understand biochemistry. How did it all start?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The famous first demonstration that life processes are material chemistry was when a guy synthesized urea. People had believed that was done by something special in the life process that couldn't be imitated in the inert world. It was demonstrated that you can make urea simply mechanically. People started thinking about the chemical processes that make up life and gradually got away from the idea that there is something unique about the life process that is distinct from chemistry.

**John Barkhausen:** I was reading that was a Swedish person who figured out urea around the Revolutionary War. But people must have experimented with bodily fluids before then. Was there much research done?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 18th century, people were figuring out a lot about how organisms work. But the official science that got published and approved by the government was a very slow process, usually 100 years behind the people on the ground who were really thinking about how things work.

**John Barkhausen:** Science, for a large part, was actually a private affair done by wealthy people—rich cranks.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So they often put their particular philosophical or religious bent into the physical ideas. Because of that personal quality, science was really more literary, interesting, and artistic before the universities took it over. Gradually, in physics, the universities took control away from the cranks and rich guys in the mid-19th century. That was the physics that Einstein, for example, was dealing with in Germany. Einstein resented the authoritarian dogma of the professors, so he invented something that outwitted the authoritarian physics establishment.

**John Barkhausen:** It seems like it takes the interest out of most fields once it gets franchised like that. Religion used to be more of a personal experience before the church took over, and it sounds like it's the same with science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think Einstein himself succumbed somewhat to authoritarian attitudes in the case of saying what an electron is. Thirty years later, I think he regretted having set things in motion in that particular direction. He never accepted the quantum mechanics view that reality is based on randomness, but he was largely responsible for setting that in motion with his theory of the photoelectric effect.

The idea of the electron as a discrete particle interacting with a photon as a discrete particle was the key idea in that photoelectric effect. A photon of a given energy would dislodge an electron from the solid state, giving it a certain voltage. So you can talk about the electronic energy or voltage of a given frequency of light, and that particularized or atomized the idea of both light and electrons. That allowed theory to take over and cover up or reject a lot of empirical, factual observation relating to light, color, electrons, molecules, and I think life.

## Electrons: Particles vs. Waves

**John Barkhausen:** Once you become an icon, you have to be very careful what you say because people might take you seriously. Can you explain further how seeing the electron as an essential part of atomic structure set us on the wrong track?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around the time of the First World War, Michael Polanyi had demonstrated a continuous potential description of how gases are bound or adsorbed on solid surfaces. That was a smooth process—a straight relationship between the pressure on the gas and the thickness of the adsorbed layer. When he went to Berlin to present his experimental work and theory, Einstein and others said, "In the advanced science world here in Germany, we know that just isn't possible because matter is particulate."

They argued you aren't going to get forces smoothly extending away from the surface. If the surface has an electrical property and the gas has an electrical property, the first layer of gas atoms hitting that surface is going to perfectly neutralize that, so there is no potential extending through space. But Polanyi's results clearly showed that a continuously thickening layer was forming. Polanyi was defeated. People like Irving Langmuir, 15 years later, got the Nobel Prize for the idea that gases can only condense in a monolayer. Polanyi knew it was wrong, but he was a physics professor and had to teach the Langmuir isotherm.

In his own experimental work, Polanyi kept seeing continuity extending. For example, working with crystals, he found that events on the surface of a crystal affected its elasticity and resistance all the way through. Physically, the surface doesn't have the meaning that it seems to in geometry. Weakening involves energy flowing over long distances. It was analogous to the idea of conduction bands in metals where electrons are delocalized. Polanyi's work suggested that maybe particulate electrons aren't the only or necessary way to think of electrons.

**John Barkhausen:** You mentioned another experiment regarding this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was in graduate school, I was reading surface physics to help understand oxidation biologically. In one of the physics journals, a man named Helmut Schwartz published a description of a funny experiment. Laser light is shined horizontally through a crystal while a beam of electrons goes through the other dimension of the crystal. The electrons passing through the crystal are deflected into a certain pattern by the electronic property of the crystal atoms.

Ordinarily, this is done by exposing a piece of photographic film to the electrons to get an image. But he found that when taking the fluorescent screen away and putting a non-reflective aluminum oxide coated layer at the bottom, the electron spots were still there, but they had the blue tint of the laser light going sideways through the crystal. The spots had to be the supposedly discrete particulate electrons to be deflected to exactly the right spots, but at that spot, there shouldn't have been any light. Yet, it was the color of the laser light modulating the beam of electrons. When I tried to talk to physics professors about it, they simply said it can't happen. You can't modulate one electron.

**John Barkhausen:** When you say modulate, you mean change color?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The color of an electron is supposed to be its relationship to the atom. What it's doing is absorbing or interacting with a particular wavelength of light. An electron flying through space having a color just wasn't acceptable. They preferred to say the person was hallucinating. But it was done at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and they had the best equipment of that sort in the world at the time. A lot of people immediately trying to replicate it didn't have the same degree of vacuum, laser power, or crystal quality. It's very easy to debunk something just by doing a slightly different setup and getting different results.

## Redshift and the Nature of Matter

**John Barkhausen:** Today's crackpot is possibly tomorrow's genius.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very recently, Helmut Schwartz, who became the head of Germany's research granting institution, said that outsiders are important everywhere, not just in science. You don't get advanced unless you have people somewhat on the fringe.

**John Barkhausen:** I was a little confused about the particulate electrons versus the wave theory. What is the alternative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since you can't explain many events in terms of particles, it becomes mathematical magic to try to make up theories to explain results like Polanyi's or Schwartz's. Albert Szent-Györgyi used conventional quantum thinking about electrons and went a long way towards explaining biological phenomena, but that doesn't necessarily validate the particulate electron.

It might be that there is an electrical ether-like material which breaks up in different ways into apparently discrete electrons. Rather than being an eternally discrete particle, the electron might be an ad hoc diffusion. The wave interpretation approaches that idea. Some subatomic thinkers are saying that the great variety of subatomic particles being seen might just be an ad hoc response of matter to a particular context or environment.

**John Barkhausen:** So it might just be an aspect you're seeing depending on the medium you're using to see it with.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. That would say that in a different solar system or galaxy, the atoms are not necessarily going to have the same functionality. That is an implication of Halton Arp's comments on his galaxy photographs. He showed what appear to be continuously connected groups of stars where one part has an extreme redshift difference from the other, meaning they should be very remote in space. But his pictures show connections, like one is being shot out of the other. He suggests the one being shot out is newly created and that new matter has a different way of vibrating which shows up as a redshift. In other words, the atoms are different when they're fresh.

**John Barkhausen:** You said that a redshift usually means something's moving away from you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the standard mechanical physics connection, like the Doppler effect.

**John Barkhausen:** But you're saying it could have other implications.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For example, light passing close to a star has a frequency shift. An Israeli physicist named Dror Sadeh was studying the light of a star passing close to the sun and a beeping pulsar passing close to the sun. He kept seeing what seemed to be a time change or frequency change depending on how close the beam came to the sun.

He got an atomic clock at the U.S. Bureau of Standards and mounted another on a truck, connected them by radio to synchronize them, and drove up the coast towards Maine. He recorded the relationship between these two clocks and saw that every morning at sunrise, Washington, D.C. seemed to be redshifted away from his truck. His argument was that something about the field of the sun coming on the scene was shifting the radio waves connecting the two clocks. Otherwise, it would have looked like you had an expanding universe to a ridiculous extent.

## Cellular Physiology and Coherence

**John Barkhausen:** Obviously, it makes a difference how you think about electrons if you're trying to figure out how these molecular processes are happening.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea of the particulate nature of matter diffused into the thinking process. Just as Einstein couldn't tolerate multilayer adsorption, biochemists can't tolerate long-range processes in biochemistry.

One of the things in chemistry that resembles what Polanyi was seeing is the inductive effect. This is the basis of fundamental biological thinking about coacervates. Bungenberg de Jong founded a line of thinking that led to Gilbert Ling's way of seeing the cell as a special state of matter. One of the basic principles is electronic induction. When you have atoms that are electron-withdrawing, the charge or intensity of the electron's effect shifts down the molecular chain towards that electron-withdrawing group.

When you take that seriously, you see this effect exists everywhere in the cell. It goes to another level: the coordinated or coherent effects of the electron-inducing groups. You have a collective reaction where you pass a threshold, sort of the way liquid water passes to solid water. You can have solid water above the melting temperature or liquid water below the freezing temperature if you don't have this cooperativity. When you combine ideas of cooperativity and induction, you get group effects where you have a change of state which passes through the bulk of the material.

**John Barkhausen:** How does this apply to proteins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can look at the effects of pH on a protein. A protein with its various charged groups responds to the pH so that the internal fields are intensified or decreased. You can have a protein expanding or collapsing according to the pH. But when you add other molecules binding to that protein, and those have electron-withdrawing or donating properties, then the way that protein responds to a certain pH is different.

These electron-withdrawing molecules are, in a sense, a partial oxidation. The degree of oxidation in a molecule defines how electron-withdrawing it is. The totality of molecules with that quality in the system affects the global degree of oxidation of the system. When it reaches a certain point, instead of just one protein collapsing, you get a freeze-melt transition where one protein triggers another, and you get coherent, cooperative changes throughout the system.

## Oxidation, Carbon Dioxide, and the Cell

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like the pH surrounding the substance and the materials attached to the substance affect how quickly a chemical change happens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You have to think of it as a flow from the environment in and out. Life is always maintaining a delicate balance between oxidation and reduction. Antioxidants are a dynamic process in which they are also oxidants. If you push towards a dominance of reduction, you kill the cell in a different way.

**John Barkhausen:** Can you explain the origin of the word "oxidant"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 18th century, they thought of phlogiston. Then Priestley and Lavoisier saw that something was being consumed from the air during burning. They saw that it generally made an acid form. Priestley named the substance that makes burning possible "oxygen"—"oxy" being the root for acid or sour.

Thinking of oxygen in relation to its ability to form acids is important to integrate with your thinking of what a cell is doing. People tend to think of carbon dioxide as simply a waste product. But if you think of the electronic balance holding the proteins of the cell in a certain state, changing the pH is crucial. Carbon dioxide turns out to be a universal balancing factor or adjuster of the acidic properties of the protein.

Carbon dioxide is an acid as defined by Gilbert Lewis. It doesn't have protons, so you needn't talk about pH really, but the arrangement—an oxygen doubly bonded to a carbon—creates that electron-withdrawing property. When it attaches to a protein, it increases the acidity of the protein, making it partially more oxidized. This changes its affinity for other things.

This is the kind of thinking that led to Gilbert Ling's orientation, accounting for cells and their metabolism without the hypothetical membrane and its pumps. You don't need a magic pump moving things in and out that would consume more energy than the cell has. The energy of the cell is produced to form carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide prevents excess electron accumulation. Since it's a continuing streaming process, you have oxygen streaming in and carbon dioxide streaming out. The carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which ionizes. You now have a negative charge on the carbon dioxide streaming out of the cell. It takes positive charges out with it—sodium and calcium.

**John Barkhausen:** Most people have heard of the membrane theory—that cells are bags holding the cytoplasm in. This is an alternative theory that it's being regulated by the products of the mitochondria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The mitochondria produces CO2. The CO2 starts as an electron acceptor, becomes negatively charged, and in leaving, drags out the positive metal ions like sodium.

**John Barkhausen:** Why is the CO2 leaving?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just because it's being constantly formed inside and diffuses out down the gradient. When it gets into the blood, it circulates to the lungs and changes back to carbon dioxide, which goes down its gradient into the fresh air. The carbon dioxide leaves the blood, leaving behind the molecules or ions that it took out of the cells. The absence of the acidic carbon dioxide in the blood leaves the blood with a higher pH.

The normal situation is for a healthy cell to be faintly under neutrality (pH 6.9) and for the blood to be definitely over neutrality (pH 7.4).

## Cancer Metabolism and Lactic Acid

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of people have seen disease as caused by low pH or too much acidity. In stress and cancer, a tumor will become very acidic. Inflammation produces high concentrations of lactic acid and a very low pH in that area. But when lactic acid is formed, the conversion from pyruvic acid to lactic acid draws an extra proton out of the NADH catalyst. In taking away this extra proton, it raises the pH *inside* the cell.

So even though a tumor is locally acidic, inside the cell it's the reverse process—an increase in pH. If the cell gets stuck producing lactic acid because it can't produce CO2, it gets stuck at a higher pH. That's where you tend to get a self-replicating tumor because the normal acidic conditions maintained by the CO2 are lost.

**John Barkhausen:** Could you give us a cliff notes version of cellular respiration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We are sandwiched between the sugar energy we get from plants and the carbon dioxide we make as the final product. Each oxidation of the sugar molecule adds chemical energy to the cell. When you are unable to oxidize the sugar all the way down to carbon dioxide and produce lactic acid instead, you lose the greatest part of the energy stored in the glucose molecule.

Without oxygen, you need some kind of oxidant to continue producing that low energy from sugar to lactic acid. To do that, cells can produce fat and get rid of their electrons by building them into fat. Building fat is a bad alternative to using up oxygen and making CO2. Cancers get stuck converting glucose to lactic acid, and they also get stuck making fat. Fat becomes their oxygen, in effect. Then, when they still have mitochondrial function, the cell burns fat as its energy source. It's a deranged metabolism to produce an irritant, lactic acid, and to do that, it has to make fat, which is then used as fuel.

**John Barkhausen:** And that's called glycolysis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's aerobic glycolysis when you make lactic acid in the presence of oxygen. Ordinary anaerobic glycolysis happens when you exercise too hard. But when you start producing lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen, as in cancer or shock, something turns the trigger so that you waste your sugar. The nervous system is involved in making that aerobic glycolysis in shock, and many suggest the nervous system is involved in the cancer transition.

**John Barkhausen:** How does the mitochondria make do with burning fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It produces less carbon dioxide. If you develop fat stores, you get particles of fat accumulating in the cytoplasm that probably have a disruptive effect. When a person is very sick with cancer, they get a gaunt look as their superficial fat stores are used up. At the same time, they convert amino acids to energy.

Our stores, the older a person gets, generally have a higher amount of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA). When you are oxidizing polyunsaturated fats, that produces more oxidative damage to the mitochondria. It tends to lower the oxidative part of metabolism and slow things down.

**John Barkhausen:** Then people end up feeling less energy and get run down.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens in midlife to lots of people; it resembles the cancer metabolism but shows up as fatigue. Some people can maintain their weight on 700 calories a day by turning off thyroid function. You're being wasteful even though you aren't using much energy. What you are using tends to be destructive, reducing connective tissue and muscle rather than living on stored fat. Basically, you're hibernating.

## Diet, Diabetes, and Stress

**John Barkhausen:** Are fats always part of the process of respiration, or is that only when you're ill?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's generally only under stress, starvation, diabetes, or high levels of stress.

**John Barkhausen:** A lot of people are on ketosis diets where they don't eat carbohydrates. Does that cause you to burn fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And protein. Your brain and some other tissues have an absolute requirement for glucose. They'll get it by breaking down amino acids from your tissues if you aren't eating enough. If you are eating amino acids and fats as your energy source, you turn on the machinery for turning amino acids into glucose and fat. That involves turning on stress hormones, which I think have chronic harmful effects.

**John Barkhausen:** Most people do it in a controlled setting.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most of the proteins being eaten under those systems are too high in phosphate and usually too high in methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan. Cysteine is an excitotoxic amino acid, and methionine is involved in stress and aging. One of the most effective life-extending diets is simply to reduce the amount of methionine. The sulfur amino acids and tryptophan are stress and aging promoters.

Also, the high phosphate in popular proteins has excitatory harmful effects. The Klotho gene, deficient in animals that age quickly, is largely a phosphate-handling protein. Meat has one of the highest ratios of phosphate to other minerals. Milk and cheese are about half and half, which is safer. Fruits and leafy green vegetables have a very safe, low phosphate content relative to calcium.

**John Barkhausen:** I have a question from a listener, Paul. He is a 34-year-old male, Type 1 diabetic for 8 months. He takes insulin and supplements but wants to prolong his "honeymoon phase" or get off insulin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I was born, my father had extreme diabetes. He went down to 90 pounds, couldn't assimilate food, and had high urine glucose. Looking at old naturopathic remedies, he started eating brewer's yeast as his only food—about two cups a day. He immediately stopped producing so much glucose in his urine and in a few months was completely well.

I think part of that effect is the hormones in the yeast which stimulate regeneration, the high potassium content which has an insulin-like action, and the high B vitamins. Having enough glucose so that you don't draw polyunsaturated fats out of storage is important; those fats are very toxic to the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Normally, beta cells are being renewed constantly. In a diabetic, they die quickly. Sugar is a factor that will prolong their lifespan.

Nitric oxide is specifically what kills the beta cells. You definitely don't want to do anything that would increase nitric oxide production, like supplementing arginine. I think aspirin, B vitamins, vitamin E, pregnenolone, and DHEA help. Someone gave rabbits diabetes with a chemical toxin and then gave them a supplement of DHEA; the ones that got DHEA regenerated a healthy pancreas.

**John Barkhausen:** You're actually advocating taking sugar or glucose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the late 19th century, doctors described cases of advanced terminal diabetes where they added about 12 ounces per day of sugar to an otherwise good diet. In just a few weeks, people came back from near death. Their reasoning was that the patients were dying so fast they were putting out the equivalent of a pound of tissue converted to sugar every day. They figured, why not let them eat what they crave to slow down the starvation? Instead, they stopped wasting away.

## Multiple Chemical Sensitivity

**John Barkhausen:** What about multiple chemical sensitivity? A listener asked about this and mentioned Luca Turin's research on odors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it relates to Luca Turin's work. He was talking about smell and psychoactive chemicals like antidepressants. What's in common is the resonance state, or the tuning of the molecule to the oxidation state. The whole system has to be tuned to a certain level of reduction and oxidation.

The addition of a chemical, whether it's an antidepressant or a perfume, passes along the conductive pathways of the nervous system. The autonomic nervous system regulates the state of inflammation. Cells like mast cells can regulate inflammation all through the body. A slight shift in your autonomic nervous system can globally change the degree of inflammation, increasing histamine and serotonin.

When you increase your intensity of mitochondrial respiration and your level of carbon dioxide, that stabilizes the system. But when you're right on the edge, a perfume molecule or food molecule can send impulses shifting you away from the oxidative processes towards the side of the nervous system that becomes dominant in shock. I think chronic fatigue and chemical sensitivity are, in effect, a variation on the physiology of shock.

**John Barkhausen:** What can someone do if they are suffering from this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Supplementing thyroid is the usual thing, but sometimes they are very low in cholesterol. Since thyroid works partly through converting cholesterol to hormones like progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone, if your cholesterol is too low, thyroid alone doesn't necessarily do it. Supplementing one or more of those will often relieve the exaggerated sensitivity.

## Oils and Hydrogenation

**John Barkhausen:** You mentioned polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) causing deterioration.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same biochemical patterns of interference with mitochondrial respiration were produced by a great variety of stresses—radiation, estrogen, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Vitamin E was found to stop the characteristic damage from feeding animals too much unsaturated fat.

Olive oil has only 8-10% of the unstable polyunsaturated fat. Butter and coconut oil have 2-3%. The safest of them all is hydrogenated coconut oil. It eliminates the unstable quality that makes things susceptible to oxidation.

**John Barkhausen:** Can you explain hydrogenation vs. dehydrogenation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the movement of electrons. When we turn saturated fat into unsaturated fat in our own bodies, we dehydrogenate it. When a cow turns unsaturated fat from their food into saturated fat for butter, bacteria in their rumen are hydrogenating it.

When you take away hydrogen atoms from adjoining carbon atoms, the electrons combine to form a double bond. The absence of the space-filling hydrogen leaves that range of electrons open and more reactive. That makes access of oxygen atoms to the fat molecule easier.

**John Barkhausen:** So that's why Crisco is a liquid oil that has had hydrogen added to make it stable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they would complete the process the way they do in changing coconut oil to 0% PUFA, you wouldn't get the trans fats. You would have totally saturated stearic acid, which would be safe. One group of researchers found that aged, defective mitochondria were restored when given fully saturated hydrogenated peanut oil.

## Salt and Physiology

**John Barkhausen:** I have questions from Martin about salt. Can salt ingestion trigger migraines? Was salt restriction useful in Gerson's tuberculosis trials?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I read Gerson's book. He was very thorough. Salts are extremely important. A contemporary researcher, William Frederick Koch, found that if he removed parathyroid glands in animals, giving them extra potassium, sodium, or magnesium had the same curative effect as calcium. One can make up for a deficiency of the other.

The Gerson diet was extremely high in potassium and magnesium. It had the amount of sodium found in juice and vegetables—a physiological amount—but a large amount of potassium. I think these were the essence of Gerson's success rather than just reducing sodium. Sodium acts as a stimulant to cell respiration and causes it to un-swell. If you lower the other minerals and give too much sodium, you can force it to swell. But when balanced, sodium increases energy production.

**John Barkhausen:** What about salt triggering migraines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you take a sudden dose of salt, it makes you swell up and retain water until your aldosterone has adjusted downward. Anything susceptible will swell up—fingers, toes, lips. But people who would get swollen feet on an airplane trip found that if they adjusted two or three days in advance by eating extra salt, they didn't get the swollen feet anymore.

When you cut back on sodium, aldosterone is increased. Aldosterone lets you retain sodium but at the expense of losing potassium and magnesium. Chronically, high aldosterone has a pro-inflammatory effect. Getting more alkaline minerals than you need suppresses aldosterone and protects your heart from inflammation and fibrosis.

Sodium works with albumin to hold water in the bloodstream. If you are low in albumin or sodium, the blood loses osmotic quality, and water stays in the tissues (edema). The remedy for edema is often adding sodium, but the basic reason for it is often a thyroid deficiency. The absence of high carbon dioxide production means you aren't able to retain sodium in your kidneys.

## Conclusion

**John Barkhausen:** Any final words on staying healthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just keeping stress down and fun up. Judging food largely by how it tastes rather than by what the experts say.
