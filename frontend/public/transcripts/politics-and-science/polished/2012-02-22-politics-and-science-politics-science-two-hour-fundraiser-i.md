## Progesterone vs. Progestins and Cancer Treatment

**John Barkhausen:** I don't think they've ever used progesterone itself. In a study in humans going back to the 40s, when progesterone was just barely becoming available, people were using it to treat cancer in humans, but it was just on an individual basis. There have been quite a few publications using medroxyprogesterone, which is not progesterone, to treat kidney cancer and breast cancer. It works somewhat, but it isn't progesterone; it doesn't have all of the good properties of progesterone and has some of the bad properties. So the best information is still from animal studies. Even those pretty much faded out after Lipschütz left the field in the 50s.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I thought I remembered one with women who had cervical cancer where they were injecting progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Oh, yeah, that was.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Was that medroxyprogesterone?

**John Barkhausen:** It was just a few women that got real progesterone. They had diagnosed them as being incurable, so they were willing to see what happened. They photographed and felt the condition of the cervix at the start, and then they injected what they thought were big doses. However, they never mentioned that any of the women were anesthetized, which happens when you give a big dose. So we don't really know how much the women were getting because they were injecting it in vegetable oil, which is an unpredictable solvent. If they weren't getting anesthetized to any extent that anyone noticed, they were hardly getting anything more than a physiological dose.

But still, during the course of the study, they saw a great improvement in the appearance, feeling, and symptoms. The bleeding decreased, the lumpiness decreased, and so on. It looked less like cancer after a few weeks of treatment. But since they didn't do the experiment intending to cure cancer, they went ahead and cut out the uteruses after a certain number of weeks had elapsed and concluded that progesterone had no promise as a treatment. The article is mostly interesting for the weird conclusion.

The article published right next to that in the same book was about treating breast cancer with estrogen. As many of the patients got worse as got better with the estrogen, yet they concluded that this stuff has great promise. Those two articles, published right against each other, are most interesting for the degree of psychosis that goes unnoticed in medical science.

## Estrogen Dominance and Brain Injury

**John Barkhausen:** And maybe in our society in general. You were pointing out the dominance of the estrogen industry over the last couple of shows. I was thinking that's kind of analogous to the dominance of estrogen in the sick person without the progesterone to oppose it. It seems like the same thing is happening in our society, which indicates to me that there's something wrong.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. This one study, I think, is still going on. D.G. Stein was the leader of the study giving progesterone within the first 24 hours after a catastrophic head injury. He found that the people survive when they get progesterone and recover remarkably well instead of just progressing to death.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's very effective, as you said, for any kind of injury. Stopping excitation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it stops edema, excitation, and deterioration of any tissue, but it is especially noticeable in the brain because edema is deadly in the brain.

**John Barkhausen:** And as Ray pointed out in the last few shows, it's not a money maker. To put it simply, progesterone is not patentable. You said they've tried to alter the molecule so they could patent it, but those artificial progestins actually have estrogenic effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, either estrogenic, androgenic, or in some cases, glucocorticoid effects. Just recently I saw an article emphasizing the difference between the real progesterone and the medroxyprogesterone that was used in the Women's Health Initiative study. This person was sounding annoyed that people were making the confusion, but I don't know how influential that publication will be.

**John Barkhausen:** And the medroxyprogesterone is actually what's called a progestin. If you're taking hormone replacement therapy, you think you're getting progesterone, but you're probably just getting progestin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It's similar enough to progesterone that it turns off your own production of progesterone. The odd thing about real progesterone is that if you aren't producing enough of it and you take some, you produce more. It reinforces the system for its own production—exactly the opposite of what the synthetic progestins do.

## Fat, Carbohydrates, and Cancer

**John Barkhausen:** On the same subject of cancer, somebody brought up the point that Craig B. Thompson, president and CEO of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, has something on YouTube where he discusses new ways to think about cancer. He concludes that if you overfeed someone with fat, you do not increase their risk of cancer at all. If you overfeed someone with carbohydrates, you dramatically increase the cancer rate, and protein is halfway in between. This person would like to hear your response to that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't read it, but I've seen a couple of other things that I think are equally crazy. Gary Taubes has an article in *Science* about a year ago saying basically the same thing, which I think he got from Dr. Lustig's video.

I have read lots of studies on the subject going back almost 90 years, and I think the evidence is very clear that fat—unsaturated fat—is, if not the only, at least by far the largest promoter of cancer. Not just in humans, but everywhere they look.

The interesting thing about carbohydrate is that the fats that we make out of carbohydrate when we eat an excess of it are anti-growth for cancer. They lower the amount of unsaturated fats circulating in our blood and they have a shift effect on the metabolism of cancer cells. They tend to restore oxidative metabolism and suppress aerobic glycolysis, which is the characteristic cancer metabolism. So this guy might have some bit of evidence in mind, but if he doesn't mention the 99% of the overwhelmingly opposing evidence, there's something wrong with his presentation.

**John Barkhausen:** Yeah, he doesn't distinguish between fats, he just says fat or carbohydrate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the ways they trick the experiment so it looks like they can improve their sales of fish fat or whatever is to give the most toxic fat to the control animals and their test substance, such as beef fat, to the other animals. The fish fat happens to oxidize so quickly that it doesn't reach the cells in quantity as great as the seed oil does.

If they're feeding a comparison between fat and sugar, for example, they'll make sure to add the carcinogenic required amount of linoleic acid to the diet. So then the sugar all goes into storage, but the animal is still being exposed to the crucial carcinogenic amount of linoleic acid. I've looked at probably 150 articles that claim to have results of that sort. It's hard to imagine that they weren't designing it just to get the results they want.

## Caller: Dairy Intolerance and Sinus Issues

**Gene:** I haven't eaten much dairy food for many years. I've been trying your diet and I started drinking whole raw milk, and my sinuses got stuffed up again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wouldn't necessarily recommend whole milk or raw milk unless you're familiar with the particular cows. If you get a bad result from one dairy or one cow, try another one that feeds the cow something different. I've felt the difference myself just between local dairies and a supermarket. There was one brand of milk that was always cheaper and tasted a little funny, and I always got sick when I drank it.

There are so many things that can go wrong. The government requires the addition of vitamin A and D to all of the commercial milk supplies. Those dairies don't like to tell how they add those vitamins, but generally, there is some diluent that the vitamins are carried in, probably an emulsifier so that they don't stick to the sides of the vessels or float to the top.

**Gene:** This milk was from a local organic raw dairy with the cream mixed in. I've had the same problem drinking or eating dairy from many different sources throughout many years. I seem to have the same response whether it's from store-bought or right from the cow.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you get that from cottage cheese or cheese?

**Gene:** Yes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Or from goat milk?

**Gene:** I don't like goat milk. I don't like the taste of that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's undoubtedly some kind of digestive problem. It's a matter of experimenting with different kinds of cheese. Have you noticed an effect on your sinus symptoms?

**Gene:** Usually once in a while it doesn't bother me, but most of the time it does. I don't have any digestive problems, just sinus, and I get mucus in my lungs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How the mucus gets there is that your intestine is being irritated. The irritation is either that you have bacteria growing on the food or the food itself contains allergens. Very often just by changing the dairy or the type of cheese, or cooking it rather than eating it raw, you can find which things cause the mucus reaction. It isn't that the milk gets into your blood and causes mucus production in your head or lungs; it's a reaction from your intestine.

**Gene:** I've been working with Lita Lee, and she suggests that I drink cream instead of milk to solve the problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never heard of anyone trying that, but I would say try some homemade skimmed milk cottage cheese first.

**John Barkhausen:** Is there any use in sneaking up on the milk consumption? Just doing a little bit at a time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person thinks they might have a problem digesting the lactose or any food that's chemically different, then if you drink two or three ounces at a meal, that exposes the intestine to the new chemical. In a week or two, or at most a month or two, the enzymes usually will express themselves, even though they might have been gone for years. You can usually induce them in a few weeks by these small samples, just a half a glass at a time. There's not enough to feed the bacteria significantly, but enough to sort of tickle the enzyme system into getting active.

## Digestive Issues and Enzymes

**Gene:** My second question is, I have a relative who's been diagnosed with chronic superficial gastritis and also an inflamed duodenum. What would you suggest there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have they been checked with an endoscopy for bacteria?

**Gene:** Yes, through a colonoscopy and also through the throat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And did they find that they had any bacterial problem growing up in the duodenum or stomach?

**Gene:** I believe so, but I'm not positive. He's had severe stomach pain for two or three years. It's been getting worse and lots of diarrhea.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's good to check things like the thyroid, but also to consider an elimination diet. There are so many foods, even natural, fresh foods; you can rank them according to their likelihood to support bacterial growth. And then there are lots of food additives. Anything with carrageenan, for example, is causing a lot of cases of inflammation of the stomach, bowel, diarrhea, and constipation. Carrageenan is showing up in an incredible number of foods, everything from organic whipping cream to squid patties.

**Gene:** Lita Lee has recommended I take a number of enzyme supplements. Are you familiar with those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but I'm very cautious with any kind of a pill-shaped supplement. In the process, there are so many allergens that can enter. So anything that especially involves microorganisms, you want to be very cautious. A couple of people have told me that when they took pure free amino acids they got incredibly sick. You have to be really cautious and maybe take a half a tablet as a trial and wait three days or so just to make sure you handle it. The same with any supplement. Vitamin C supplements can cause terrible problems for people. I've seen people who had terrible sinus symptoms for years, and when I suggested they lay off their vitamin supplements for a week, they didn't ever have a runny nose again.

**John Barkhausen:** Not too much of a testimonial for vitamins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For a while, I was counseling at an alternative health place in Eugene where allergies were a big problem because of the grass fields. For a couple of years, I had a reputation for curing everyone's allergies by getting them to stop their vitamins.

## Lyme Disease and Hypothyroidism

**Gene:** Are you familiar with Lyme disease and any connection with that and thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hypothyroidism is often misdiagnosed as Lyme disease. Candida is the other thing. If you can't find the cause, then Lyme disease and Candida are the first suspects. But usually, it's just hypothyroidism.

**Gene:** What if you test positive for Lyme?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of people do. We all tend to be exposed to spirochetes and there's overlap with other spirochetes. A course of antibiotics for a week or two is a way to eliminate it. The Lyme disease can be eradicated, just as syphilis would be, for example. But by avoiding looking for other causes, such as hypothyroidism, some doctors make a good business out of the Lyme treatments forever.

**Gene:** I've been working with a naturopathic doctor who recommends antibiotics for the initial onset of Lyme, but then mostly herbs. He says the antibiotics force the spirochete to create a hard shell around themselves, which is why the symptoms desist after antibiotics. But then over time, the spirochetes break out of the shell and migrate around your body, especially in joints, which is why people experience joint pain years after the initial onset.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they haven't eliminated an endocrine problem, what I see is that the hypothyroid people with low immune function also get the whole range of symptoms that are blamed on that, such as arthritis. If you can cure the disease by correcting the thyroid, it's a lot easier.

About 40 or 45 years ago, a friend of mine had an accident working on his house, and the stress of it apparently brought on severe arthritis. He went to his doctor, who examined him and didn't prescribe cortisone for his arthritis; he prescribed Armour Thyroid because he saw he was hypothyroid. My friend was really annoyed and went home grumbling that the doctor had fixed something that he thought wasn't broken. After a week or two of taking the thyroid, his arthritis disappeared and never came back. Not many doctors are aware of connections such as injury, stress, arthritis, and hypothyroidism. Most doctors would prescribe cortisone to treat the symptoms. I think a lot of the Lyme doctors are doing a similar thing—making a simple problem complex.

**John Barkhausen:** Is it possible that the bite from the tick triggers some anti-thyroid response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably low thyroid people have a bigger inflammatory response and are more likely to fail to throw off the infection. So if you have the diagnosis, it's good to take a course of antibiotics. A good combination of antibiotics is well established as a cure.

**John Barkhausen:** So you really think Lyme disease is just a thyroid problem that's triggered by the immune system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not the disease, but the diagnosis. I would say 80 or 90% of the people that I've talked to have been to doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating it chronically.

**John Barkhausen:** And have you had luck treating people for Lyme?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but they get well and forget about the Lyme diagnosis.

## Endotoxins and Digestion

**John Barkhausen:** So you give them nutritional advice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think the power of undigested food is very underestimated. Overcooking food, like people used to do 100 years ago, is much better for the digestion because we aren't designed to eat undercooked or raw vegetable matter. Bacteria can eat it. If someone happens to have just the right mix of bacteria, their bacteria can eat their vegetables secondarily and release some of the nutrients. But if you get the wrong bacteria, then they produce toxins rather than nutrients.

**John Barkhausen:** And that's the endotoxin problem that you've referred to.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, endotoxin and many other things. Allergens released from the specific plant material, as well as bacterial toxins.

**John Barkhausen:** It's always amazed me that you talk about endotoxin all the time. If you look it up on the Internet, there's a lot of information about it. It's a real thing. It actually causes severe problems. And that seems to be well recognized. But I've talked to several doctors, internists about it. Smart people. They've never ever heard of it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I guess they forgot that section in medical school during a generation or two. In the 19th century, the intestine was a big focus of Anglo-American medicine. They were very interested in what the intestine does to the whole system—the brain-intestine symptom interactions and the other organs as they're influenced by the intestine. That was still pretty big up until 1920, and then there was a campaign against it.

Walter C. Alvarez, a newspaper gastroenterologist, helped to suppress the intestine culture. In popular medicine, for example, there was a belief that migraines or headaches in general were produced by toxins absorbed from the intestine. He was of the new school that didn't want to think about the intestine so much. So he stuffed wads of cotton into his medical students' rectums and reported that the next morning a certain proportion of them had headaches caused just by the pressure in the rectum. He said, "So you see, headaches are caused by pressure, not by toxins." But he didn't put any toxins in his students' intestines, so he didn't disprove the idea; it was just a little propaganda bit.

But other people, Russians for example, studied in more detail that toxins, nutrition, and pressure interact very meaningfully. In an experimental animal, for example, they would put a balloon in the intestine and blow it up and nothing would happen. But if they gave the animal hypoglycemia and then blew up the intestine, unpredictable things would happen all through the rabbit. It would have hormonal and neurological reactions triggered just by that pressure. Blowing up a balloon in the intestine could cause seizures or wheezing or all kinds of widespread reactions.

**John Barkhausen:** And that's when you have low blood sugar. That's when it's particularly dangerous to have blockages.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. French and Canadian researchers, instead of using pressure, combined allergens. They would feed a bit of walnut to an animal and it would maybe sneeze from the allergens in it. Then they would give it moderate hypoglycemia and feed it the same thing and it would die in shock. And then if they would give another bunch of animals slight hyperglycemia by infusing some glucose and feed them the same walnut, they wouldn't even sniffle.

**John Barkhausen:** Wow. So that goes along with what you said, that sugar or glucose is protective. It's very important to keep your blood sugar up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think the particular researcher who did that was named Adamkiewicz and it was published in a book by Gaëtan Jasmin.

## Bowel Movements and Fiber

**John Barkhausen:** As long as we're on the subject of digestion, how important is it that people have regular bowel movements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The person who popularized fiber 40 or 50 years ago in the US was studying the African relative freedom from bowel problems and cancer. He saw that they typically would have three bowel movements a day and that they ate lots of potatoes. He thought it was the fiber in the potato stimulating the intestine that seemed to protect their bowel. So he published things about the benefits of fiber. The cereal industry in the US started selling oat bran as the preventive of colon cancer, which caught on in the 70s. But then in the 80s, some Australians tested oat bran diets on animals and found that it promoted and increased the incidence of bowel cancer, apparently by the nature of the breakdown product.

**John Barkhausen:** I don't think that knowledge has ever gotten around.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not very well. But in general, fiber does clean the intestine. Keeping it moving lowers the estrogen level. The bile puts out and tries to get rid of toxic materials, including estrogen. If you don't have a regular movement through the intestine, a lot of that gets recycled, reabsorbed, and raises your general exposure to toxins, including estrogen.

## Medicinal Marijuana

**John Barkhausen:** What do you think of medicinal marijuana in its relationship to cancer and AIDS? Is it efficacious?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It helps with the nausea. If a person is having symptoms and can control the symptoms with it, it's very effective for many people. When I was 10, a doctor gave me a bag, didn't say what it was, but prescribed a cup of tea every day. Years later I recognized the taste of it as marijuana. It was supposed to prevent my headaches, but it didn't do anything noticeable for me.

It used to be prescribed a lot as a tea and I think it's a lot safer that way than smoking it because the smoke itself is carcinogenic and estrogenic. The various chemicals in the leaf are themselves slightly estrogenic or anti-androgenic. So I think that's probably the main concern for someone who's using it regularly. But I think there are other probably healthier solutions for nausea. The anti-serotonin drugs and simply increasing the blood sugar, salt, and sugar very often help with nausea.

## Caller: Fish Oil and Omega-3 Supplements

**Roger:** My question centers around omega-3 fatty acids. A couple of years ago I came across a supplement of whole salmon fish oil that contained omega-3s and it was touted as being a great supplement to help arthritis and lower triglyceride levels. Then I read your research, which sort of contradicted all of these things. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you think the dangers are of taking supplements of fish oil. I've been seeing that these fatty acids are showing up in all kinds of organic products like organic milk and baby formula.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Someone two or three years ago analyzed the baby formulas and found that the great bulk of the omega-3 fat that had been added to it had broken down and was probably in a toxic form. So their worst feature is that they break down and oxidize very fast. A couple of researchers have looked for them in the blood at the time that they are having their anti-inflammatory actions and found that they had already broken down. Just between the mouth and the bloodstream they broke down into completely new chemicals which were what accounted for their anti-inflammatory effect.

But those same breakdown products are what in the long run suppress the whole immune system and have a lot of other toxic effects. So the short-range anti-inflammatory effect I see as analogous to the anti-inflammatory treatments I used to give with X-ray or other radiation.

**Roger:** What would some of the other negative effects be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The whole immune system gets turned down so that it doesn't produce the inflammation that's bothering you. But in the long run, that makes you susceptible to all kinds of infections. And I think in the long run it increases the risk of cancer and all of the age-related degenerative processes.

**Roger:** Do you think it would be important to continue to monitor people who are using these omega supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few people are doing that and warning about their increased use. It seems like a very bad idea to put it in powdered baby food because the time and oxygen exposure before it's eaten does a terrific job of degrading those fats because they're so unstable.

**Roger:** What should we look for as a symptom that this is a problem? More infections, more colds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, more infections would be the first thing. I've seen that in experimental animals and there have been some studies in people in which their immune systems were relatively inert against various organisms. With the anti-inflammatory X-ray treatments that they used in the 40s so enthusiastically, it took from 10 to 15 years before they saw the harmful effects of them.

**Roger:** What can we do as consumers to alert others or get doctors to conduct additional research? I have called various manufacturers and milk companies who are using the product and they assured me that everything was completely fine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same with the additives. They're putting in so many products like the fumed silica (silicon dioxide) that you see in vitamin pills and drugs and even foods, and titanium dioxide. These things are proven risky at best. But you talk to the companies that use them and they don't want to think about it. They won't respond to sending them an article indicating that they somehow selectively misread the research incriminating material. It's hard to counter someone's occupational commitment to something that isn't helpful.

## Scientific Bias and Censorship

**John Barkhausen:** Ray, maybe you can explain why it's come about that most of society in scientific culture is invested in these products that actually, although they might help inflammation in the short run, cause cancer in the long run. How did we get here?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The whole idea of science has been shaped by commerce and the military. The people who have something very powerful to gain from using science in a certain way support it being used that way. The people who are trying to be objective don't have any ulterior motives and that means they don't have a source of funding.

**John Barkhausen:** Like there are minority views in science about issues like this, and my understanding is they just can't get published.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. Have you looked at some of the controversies in other fields of science, such as Halton Arp and his quasar astronomy?

**John Barkhausen:** No.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He was successful in his career as long as he published his pictures in his *Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies*. As long as he just said, "Here's odd stuff I've been finding." But when he pointed out some very orderly things that related the redshift of quasars to the redshift of galaxies that they were clearly part of, they said, "You can't use our telescopes anymore." Even though he was funded by taxpayers' money, they wouldn't let him use the public telescopes.

**John Barkhausen:** I guess what I've become aware of during the show is that there are scientific dynasties. People get to the top of their career and obviously, I think it's just human nature, they don't want to be... They feel like their own reputation and status is on the line if their theory ends up being proven not to be true.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There's a little one or two-minute video of Halton Arp talking about his experiences and he actually quotes some of the things that happened to him on his way out of the profession. Very ridiculous things that the top people in the field said and did.

## Caller: The Immune System

**Justin:** I was wondering if Ray could elaborate on any misconceptions he thought science might have in its view of the immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the best answer to that is to look at the articles by Polly Matzinger and Jamie Cunliffe. I think they are inspired by the thinking of Élie Metchnikoff who was contemporary with Ehrlich, the "magic bullet" drug person.

The German view of the immune system is the one that was profitable to the chemical drug industry—looking for a magic bullet that would kill each kind of germ, and then by extension applying it to cancer, looking for chemicals that would kill cancer cells and not human non-cancer cells.

But Metchnikoff took a totally different approach to the immune system: the developmental, nutritional, morphogenic approach. That didn't find any commercial sponsors. It was the French-Russian orientation that actually was the biological orientation rather than the industrial.
