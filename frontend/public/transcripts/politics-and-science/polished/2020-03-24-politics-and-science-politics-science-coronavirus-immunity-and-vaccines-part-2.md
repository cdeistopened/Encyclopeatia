## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Hey and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhausen. This week we return to part two of our conversation with Dr. Raymond Peat. This was recorded on March 24, 2020, and we are discussing the Coronavirus COVID-19, which has caused a lockdown in the United States in many areas due to its expected high contagion rate and potentially serious mortality rate.

Dr. Raymond Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology and hormones. His newsletter is available at RayPeat.com.

Ray, thanks for coming back on Politics and Science today. We're in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic declared by the World Health Organization and the CDC. Everyone is having a hard time and is very scared. I just listened to a podcast with a New York Times reporter talking to an epidemiologist saying that it's going to be very bad and we're not taking enough across-the-board measures. They argued that state responses are too piecemeal and there needs to be strong federal action to make sure everybody stays home. I wonder what your take is on that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I am still not convinced that anything special is happening. Did we talk about the German virologist Wolfgang Wodarg?

**John Barkhausen:** No, we didn't yet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He is a well-known expert in pulmonology and viruses. As of the last time I checked his website, he still wasn't convinced that anything different from previous years is happening. He showed that in previous years, 5% to 15% of infectious lung disease was caused by some type of coronavirus. So far, this one hasn't really been proven to be much more virulent or infectious, though that is yet to be determined. They've jumped to the conclusion that it is both more harmful and spreads faster, but you can't find that in the evidence.

According to Wodarg and another German pulmonologist and virologist named Sucharit Bhakdi, the country is causing considerable economic damage and harming older people by the measures they're introducing without real evidence that anything special is happening. Another well-known epidemiologist, John Ioannidis at Stanford, says this might be one of history's greatest evidence fiascos because they're talking about fragments of evidence, drawing huge conclusions, and taking unprecedented political and economic actions against no clear scientific evidence.

**John Barkhausen:** Could you spell the names of the German epidemiologists so people can look up their evidence?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first one was Wolfgang Wodarg (W-O-D-A-R-G). The second is Bhakdi (B-H-A-K-D-I).

**John Barkhausen:** And the guy at Stanford is John Ioannidis. They're saying that the Trump administration isn't doing enough.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've always been considered crazy for pointing out that Trump, in many ways, has been less harmful than the so-called progressives like Obama. He tends to be withdrawing from wars, for example. I'm inclined to see his reluctance to go ahead with the "war on the virus" as another virtue, even though everyone considers that crazy. The Pentagon wanted to go back into Iraq heavily in retaliation against a couple of soldiers getting killed, and he used the virus as an argument against renewing the war in Iraq. So even though he's being criticized for going against the grain, so far I think he's justified by the evidence.

## Ventilators, Oxygen, and Inflammation

**John Barkhausen:** What do you make of the reports from Italy where people over 65 aren't being allowed to have a ventilator? People are doing triage and some are basically told they'll have to die.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a video from a hospital in Bergamo. It looked like they were stuffing people in oxygen tents and putting oxygen masks on them. If people come in with a minor respiratory ailment and they're elderly, putting them into a pure oxygen atmosphere is exactly the wrong thing to do. However, almost all hospitals in the world do this, thinking that because they are having trouble breathing, they need pure oxygen.

Carbon dioxide is anti-inflammatory. When you give them pure oxygen—five times more than normal—you are displacing the natural balance of carbon dioxide. Several good research projects have found that if you hypoventilate people who are having problems in the hospital, letting the CO2 build up reduces inflammation and produces much better outcomes.

Inflammation is a pathogen in any kind of sickness, especially in this virus infection. The symptoms are basically inflammatory. The angiotensin system and the interferon system turn on other inflammatory agents like histamine. All of the defensive reactions triggered by these respiratory infections amplify inflammation, causing congestion, constriction, swelling, and exudation of serum into the lungs. Instead of a balanced moisture economy in the lungs, the serum and proteins in the blood ooze out into the lung space and interfere with breathing.

Anything you do to increase inflammation is going to increase that pneumonia tendency. Oxygen and many of the virucidal chemicals they are given greatly intensify inflammation. That's one of the reasons old people are so susceptible. Different studies say about 85% of proven infected people have almost no symptoms. The ones who react badly are mostly the very old who already have some kind of degenerative, circulatory, or inflammatory disease.

I see the changes of aging that cause circulatory problems as essentially overactivity of the immune system—a general tissue degenerative process that exaggerates inflammatory processes. In one study where they gave a known coronavirus intended to produce common cold symptoms, they found that people with pre-existing inflammatory problems were the ones that reacted more seriously. In mice studies, they find that the virus does very little damage to young animals. The older the animal is, with a more mature immune system, the more harmful the virus is. In this situation, the so-called immune defenses are really the instrument by which the virus is damaging the organism.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's the reaction of the organism to the virus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A successful virus succeeds by causing something like chronic diarrhea and a chronic cough. If the person stays well enough to go around living normally but coughing, that's good for the virus to spread. A successful virus doesn't kill many of its infected hosts.

## Economic Consequences

**John Barkhausen:** If you're already inflamed and the virus attacks your cells, you're much more likely to have an over-immune reaction. That reminds me of what we're doing socially or politically right now. If what you're saying is correct, we're having an overreaction to the threat of this virus which could potentially cause a lot of damage to our society.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It already is causing unemployment. It's being taken as an opportunity. Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen proposed that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department join up so that the taxpayers will be made responsible for everything the Fed does, allowing them to bail out big corporations at their choice. This leads to super-corporations guaranteed by the government and taxpayers, but no guarantees for employees of middle-sized and small companies. It's pushing towards total monopoly.

**John Barkhausen:** Naomi Klein has written about this in her book *The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism*. This seems like a combination of disaster capitalism and fascism, if the definition of fascism is the combination of corporate and federal power.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. Except as it's going, it bypasses some of the nastiness of Hitlerism and Mussolini's fascism and goes directly to giving orders around the world to stop protests and interfere with elections. For example, the Yellow Vests in France aren't able to go into the streets as they've been doing for a year. It has established total quiescence and political control.

## Vaccines: History and Efficacy

**John Barkhausen:** I see a lot of talk on social media saying, "If only we had a vaccine that would save us." Could you speak about the efficacy of vaccines in terms of flus and this virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** During the great swine flu pandemic that didn't exist [in 1976], the man in charge of influenza vaccines at the CDC pointed out to his superiors that the time it takes to develop a flu vaccine is usually a year to a year and a half. By that time, the flu germ has spread, reached its peak, and disappeared. People are naturally immune to that particular strain by the time the vaccine comes on the market. He lost his job for saying this on television—I think it was Phil Donahue.

Later, *60 Minutes* did a detailed analysis of the failure of the epidemic. Only one soldier was confirmed to have died of the flu virus—no one else in the world, by the admission of the head of the CDC—but hundreds died from the vaccine. Now, when someone says that vaccines are confirmed to be useless and dangerous, and can't conceivably be produced in time to prevent the disease, those people are called quacks.

**John Barkhausen:** In the history of vaccines, have there been useful ones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When it's an organism that doesn't change faster than the vaccine can be produced. Smallpox was probably the best example of a vaccine being able to totally abolish a disease when used intelligently. They would identify outbreaks and form a ring of vaccinated people around those outbreaks, letting the disease run its course inside that ring. By repeatedly doing that, they eradicated the virus from nature.

**John Barkhausen:** Because smallpox didn't mutate quickly, they could get a handle on it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I think other diseases are probably slow enough to change that they could be treated similarly if the effort were made. The cost for eliminating smallpox on a world scale was microscopic compared to the annual expense on measles and the standard array of vaccines kids get in the US. The cost alone is enough to lead to a more intelligent policy.

**John Barkhausen:** I think you said the cost now is $4.5 to $50 billion a year just for vaccines for children.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And they are stupidly used, trying to vaccinate the whole world rather than closing in on the virus. If you have an outbreak at Disney World, you can track those people and vaccinate everyone around them. Vaccines have a consistent and predictable rate of damage—mortality, paralysis, brain damage. Autism is one of the outcomes. The government pays at least a proportion of the people they harm, acknowledging the damage, but they prefer to pay for a stupid use of vaccines.

**John Barkhausen:** The testing is also of questionable merit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The safety testing is absolutely crooked. Some vaccines contain harmful adjuvants like aluminum hydroxide, added because it causes a systemic inflammatory reaction. That is often more harmful than the germ itself. When testing the safety of a vaccine, you would expect them to test the vaccine against a placebo. But in some studies, they gave the adjuvant to the control group as well. So they're creating a certain level of damage in their control group and comparing that to the damage in the complete vaccine. I can't think of any way a person could design that experiment without intending to defraud.

**John Barkhausen:** In your recent newsletter, you mentioned a fellow named John Williamson, called "Johnny Notions." How did his vaccines work if they didn't have this adjuvant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The smallpox vaccine all by itself is irritating enough; it doesn't need an adjuvant. He reasoned that if he could weaken this nasty material, it would be safer. He would take pus or scab from a person with smallpox, smoke it, pack it under leaves and a layer of camphor, and bury it for years. This was in the 1700s, so almost nothing was known about chemistry, but he intuited that he was weakening the agent.

He would then introduce it into the skin—not into the muscle or blood. He had a very fine tool to split the skin so it went into the living material but didn't reach the blood. He vaccinated thousands, and none of them died from the vaccine, whereas many would have from a modern vaccine.

**John Barkhausen:** What's the difference between a dermal application and having something injected into your bloodstream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments in the last 10 years show that when you take a particular antigen and either inhale it, eat it, rub it into the skin, or inject it carefully intradermally, the systemic results are absolutely different from injecting it into the blood or muscle. The immune system is designed to react in a maximally appropriate way when things are encountered via natural routes. We don't have an evolved immune system for proper reactions to needle injections into the muscles.

The use of needles seems to have been a matter of professionalism in the 1800s. Doctors were the only ones with access to needles and syringes. They claimed a monopoly on the "most effective" way to give medication, rather than the "crude" way of eating or inhaling it. There never was any valid scientific basis for giving medications by injection.

## Immune System Theories: Antibodies vs. Damage Repair

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reaction from injection is largely a reaction to tissue damage, leading to autoimmune-type reactions—more reactions against your tissues than against the antigen. The antibody theory of immunity is essentially a superstructure built on ignorance of how the immune system works.

The antibody theory came about more than 100 years ago with Paul Ehrlich's "lock and key" idea, which was a way to sell chemical drugs. The antibody became the model for a specific drug cure. However, there is an alternative view gaining recognition: the Danger Theory (Polly Matzinger) or Damage Theory (Jamie Cunliffe).

In this view, the immune system isn't on the outlook for "pathogens." The organism has a picture of itself that it wants to preserve. When it experiences damage, it recognizes that part of itself is out of place. In the process of correcting the damage, the pathogenic cause tends to be eliminated. But the emphasis is on maintaining or restoring the image of the body rather than learning images of potential invaders.

**John Barkhausen:** Since flus and viruses adapt too quickly for vaccines, it sounds like we should depend on the innate immune system. How do we get that to work for us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Making people healthy and exposing them to fewer vaccines as they grow up is important. Allergic people are known to be the ones who react the worst to coronaviruses. The degenerative or autoimmune changes that happen with aging make a person more susceptible. A person with an abundant energetic metabolism, without a lot of inflammatory experiences, can produce the most organized and almost unnoticed rejection of the infection. The 80% of people who don't know they're infected are the ones with a good immune system.

## Physiology: Interferon, Angiotensin, and ACE2

**John Barkhausen:** You mentioned that a lung infection triggers angiotensin, interferon, and histamine reactions. How do interferon and histamine react with the coronavirus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the main things the interferon system does is activate the production of nitric oxide. In vitro, nitric oxide is a very good virus killer—it's a free radical that will destroy just about anything. However, in experimental infections with nerve-targeted coronaviruses, they found that blocking interferon's production of nitric oxide prevents the death of the animal. It is specifically the interferon production of nitric oxide that kills the host.

Similarly, serotonin is produced by inflammation. The Chinese are using Cinanserin, a serotonin blocker, as one of their tools against the coronavirus.

**John Barkhausen:** Serotonin causes veins to tighten up. What is the purpose of that in a healthy creature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tightening the circulatory system helps raise pressure and get more blood to a problem area. It's an emergency function. It's appropriate to think of these inflammatory things as wound-healing agents. If you have a hole punched in you, these are appropriate for directing healing efforts to that spot. But when they spread from your lungs into the whole organism, the organism suffers because that repair system is damaging when generalized.

**John Barkhausen:** Can you describe the angiotensin cycle again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress and estrogen make the liver produce more angiotensinogen. This is a protein cleaved by renin (an enzyme from the kidney) to produce Angiotensin I. Then, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) produces Angiotensin II. Angiotensin II leads to all these inflammatory things.

There is another enzyme called ACE2. Its main function is to destroy Angiotensin II. The coronavirus attaches to and inactivates ACE2. This leaves the body with unchecked Angiotensin II and its inflammation.

**John Barkhausen:** You said ACE2 is a sign of a youthful person. If you have a lot of that, it means you're keeping that stress hormone down. But that begs the question: why are young people not affected by the coronavirus since they have more ACE2 for the virus to attack?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have enough of it, it outweighs whatever the virus does. A healthy young person can sacrifice some of their ACE2 to the virus without succumbing to the symptoms. They still have anti-inflammatory ACE2 in reserve. Components of good health—Vitamin B1, progesterone, aspirin—help keep your ACE2 levels up.

## Listener Questions

**John Barkhausen:** A listener asks about Dr. Christian Drosten, who noted that some recovered patients did not have neutralizing antibodies. What do you think of the role of neutralizing antibodies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the healthy young person without too many vaccinations has an immune system that reacts correctly and doesn't bother getting to the antibody stage. As I mentioned regarding the Damage Theory, the immune system is there to repair damage. If you have autoimmunity, it's because something is prolonging the repair process. You want to give it more energy to complete the repair rather than trying to poison the system that makes the antibodies.

**John Barkhausen:** Another listener asks about a paper in *Nature* regarding T-cells. It suggests COVID-19 damages CD4 T-cells and promotes exhaustion of CD8 T-cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would have to read the article, but apparently something has killed part of the T-cell repertoire.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think the reaction to the coronavirus is a response to the anti-vax movement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It will be a good excuse for suppressing them more actively. The internet is already being biased against them communicating.

**John Barkhausen:** A listener asks about 5G and RF radiation risks being similar to coronavirus risks.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The damage done by chronic exposure to that kind of radiation weakens the basic quiet immune system, predisposing you to the inflammatory reaction.

**John Barkhausen:** Regarding ACE2, some suggest decreasing things that increase ACE2 expression, yet research suggests things like Losartan (which increases ACE2) are helpful. Can you suggest things that increase ACE2 expression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That argument against increasing ACE2 was published in *The Lancet*, but I think those people hadn't read the relevant literature. Increasing ACE2 goes beyond what the virus infects and has a protective effect. Progesterone, aspirin, Vitamin B1, and likely anti-serotonin agents help maintain ACE2.

**John Barkhausen:** What are your thoughts on social isolation as a remedy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It limits the spread of viruses, which would be helpful in any flu season. But I think the harm done by the pressure to enforce isolation is greater than the benefit of keeping respiratory infections lower, especially since the contagion doesn't seem that serious so far.

**John Barkhausen:** A listener mentions a British nurse warning against NSAIDs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wanted to mention that the approach to killing the virus is almost always worse than the effect of the virus. Three of the most often mentioned antiviral remedies—Chloroquine, Acyclovir, and nucleoside analogs—are aimed at killing the virus by damaging its DNA or RNA replication. These also happen to damage human DNA at the expense of mutating millions of people. These protections are really very serious harms; they damage the gonads and the retina.

## Vitamin C and General Health

**John Barkhausen:** A listener asks about claims that Vitamin C can increase interferon and cause a cytokine storm.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has been my personal experience. In 1956, when Vitamin C became cheap, I took a 500mg tablet and immediately got cold symptoms. I found that I could consume 4,000mg a day of natural Vitamin C by eating simply and eliminating grains, with no problem at all. But 2mg of the commercial stuff produced reactions.

A chemist dissolved 500mg of reagent-grade ascorbic acid in distilled water and measured the free radicals. He said that amount contained enough heavy metal contaminants to oxidize the Vitamin C into its free radical state, equivalent to a killing dose of X-rays. Just the iron contaminant alone would replicate that reaction.

**John Barkhausen:** So you should get Vitamin C from fruit and meats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meats, fruit, and even milk. All animals except people, guinea pigs, and primates make their own. So all animal foods are generously supplied with Vitamin C.

**John Barkhausen:** You mentioned eliminating grains. Do grains chelate the Vitamin C?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, they are just free of Vitamin C. They are the only food that is free of it.

**John Barkhausen:** So, Aspirin, B1, vitamins, and not grains. Any other suggestions for keeping the immune system up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D is one of the most important. It works with thyroid, progesterone, and ACE2 to quiet reactions. Also, keeping a high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your diet works with Vitamin D to hold down inflammatory reactions. Vitamin A is also important for the membranes—eyes, nose, lungs—to keep protein turnover at an ideal level.

**John Barkhausen:** Is there anything else you'd like to add?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Looking at the videos I mentioned by Wodarg or Bhakdi will help reduce the panic. Also, do you know David Icke? There is a recent video of his on the coronavirus. I never thought of him as saying anything sensible—normally I would consider him a borderline maniac—but the only thing I disagreed with in this interview was his saying that sugar is immunosuppressive. Everything else he says seems okay.

**John Barkhausen:** I'd like to talk to you sometime about the importance of keeping blood sugar at an optimal level, because a lot of people are talking about fasting to boost their immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just 24 hours of fasting is enough to damage all of your functions, especially energy production. Energy is a basic thing for maintaining your non-inflammatory immune system.

**John Barkhausen:** Ray, thanks so much for being on Politics and Science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks. Bye.
