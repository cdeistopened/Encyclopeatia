## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** This is *Politics and Science* and I'm your host, John Barkhausen. This is a special extended interview with Ray Peat, done on the 4th of March, 2015, from the studios of WMRW. The subject was evolution and Lamarck, although that hardly gets mentioned. Ray Peat has a PhD in biology and a specialty in physiology. Ray, if you wouldn't mind, maybe you could introduce yourself a little more.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My dissertation was on reproductive physiology—specifically, the influence of female aging on the oxidative processes in the uterus. I went to graduate school in biology after having studied literature and linguistics previously. I had the intention of studying the brain and how the brain can create language, because the brain biology people were the most dogmatic, next to the genetics people. I looked around and found that the reproductive physiology professor was actually a scientist, so I did my work in that area.

**John Barkhausen:** You've been interested in science your whole life. It's fairly impressive that as a child you were reading many scientific texts. When did you first run into the subject of the origin of life and evolution?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We had a little old Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedia from my parents—they got it around 1930, I think. That was where I first ran into some of the really interesting science things when I was seven, eight, or nine years old. Then in 1950, we got the new Britannica, which had bigger articles. Both of them were very objective on the issue of Lamarckism versus Darwinism. So, I had heard about the inheritance of acquired traits when I was probably eight years old.

One of the stories that stuck in my mind was done by Michael Guyer at the University of Wisconsin. I think he ground up the eyes of rabbits and injected them to produce antibodies. By treating pregnant rabbits so that they became immune to the eyeball tissue, the babies were born with defective eyes. He then cross-mated these offspring and found that the defective eyes were inherited as if they were genetic traits in subsequent generations. No one really repeated that as far as I know, and it was pretty widely accepted. He was a very standard, mostly Darwinian biologist.

He was doing that research around the same time that Paul Kammerer in Vienna was experimenting with marine invertebrates, toads, and salamanders to show that when they acquired an adaptation, the offspring would show traits that had been acquired by the parents. Paul Kammerer was viciously attacked. He committed suicide in 1926 in the midst of a very intense attack against his midwife toad experiments. Someone had apparently injected ink into the spot that was supposed to be an inherited mating pad on the toad's feet. The person who mostly condemned him as a fraud was William Bateson, a hardline English geneticist. When Kammerer sent samples of his specimens to England, he invited biologists to examine them. Several well-known biologists did examine them and reported that they were convincing, but William Bateson refused to go to the meeting to examine the specimens. He immediately resumed his attacks. Bateson really didn't want to look at the evidence because he knew it was not there.

## The Politics of Evolutionary Theory

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe you could tell us why this debate over the theories of evolution is important. Why are people getting so upset about this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is essentially a religious or political argument. The whole mystique of science wants to say that there is a simple, objective science: you follow a certain method, you get an absolute result. If you don't get what you "should" get, then it has to be pseudoscience or fraud. But the context is very closely related to your social, economic, political, and religious background.

If you look at Darwin, for example, he was a pretty progressive thinker in a lot of ways—he was against slavery—but he was essentially from the upper class and had the habits and way of life of the ruling class. Despite his progressive traits, he was really in the mainline of 19th-century British imperialist thinking. That quality stuck with the idea of Darwinian evolution. The social Darwinists really developed what was an essential part of Darwin's thinking, and that was later taken up by the fascists. Eugenics had a Darwinian genetic basis—racial improvement and so on.

People who want to claim Darwin as their intellectual ancestor don't like to recognize that he was a pretty crazy imperialist racist. He believed that even English plants were better than plants in other countries and would displace them if given the opportunity. Just like he believed the English people and Europeans would finally exterminate and eliminate by competition what he called the "intermediate races" between the higher apes and the civilized Europeans. He believed that even the higher apes, along with Australians and Africans, would go out of existence because of the superiority of Europeans.

**John Barkhausen:** So the idea of where we all came from is a powerful one in manipulating people to be on the side of your ideology.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way science is taught, it really doesn't free itself from ideology. Whatever the ideological system existed around your physics professors and their professors gets built into a belief of how science works, how the brain works, and is a philosophy of the nature of being and the creation of the universe. My professors in all of the sciences just didn't want to think about their philosophical commitments. It was "scientific," and that was that.

**John Barkhausen:** They wouldn't look at any of their preconceptions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The extent of philosophy might have been to have read Percy Bridgman's operationalism approach, saying that if you can't measure it, it isn't real. Some professors with philosophical minds saw that as their foundation.

## Essentialism vs. Empiricism

**John Barkhausen:** I think you are the reason this show is called *Politics and Science*. Before I read your writings, I thought science was an objective art practiced by dedicated people with integrity. I didn't think business interests, corruption, or vanity played a role, but it turns out it's just as subject to human vices as any other field.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Early in the 20th century, you could trace the personality of the academic culture to the 19th-century conflicts regarding religion—whether the old pre-Enlightenment religion should still be in power, or whether a newer 18th/19th-century loosening of religious ideas should be the rule. But the missing thing was to see that there is a conflict between *essentialism*—which was the old absolutist religious approach, the Platonic idea that species never change because they are timeless identities—and the *empirical* or *existentialist* approach, which looks at the actual historical situation in front of you.

That is where the real difference in interpreting science comes in. You can see it in every field. The anti-essentialists tend to be on the fringe. For example, in cosmology, you have the Electric Universe people providing coherent descriptions of observed facts against the Big Bang mechanistic universe. Halton Arp, the astronomer, made pictures of galaxies that were visibly connected to each other but moving at tremendously different velocities. According to the redshift Big Bang theory, you can't have things tied together that are moving at extremely different speeds (implying different distances). The reason he was able to see and think about that was that he wasn't committed to an essentialist idea that every atom is the same at every moment of time and every place in the universe.

**John Barkhausen:** It's interesting that it all boils down to your school of thought: whether you start with the essentialist form or the empirical form. You’ve said before that Aristotle was the founder of the empirical movement.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think he was just about as fully developed as anyone as a thinker. People like Leibniz were still thinking in some of Aristotle's ideas—for example, analyzing cause into different types of causality, including *final cause*. The condemnation of teleological explanations has been a big part of essentialist, mechanistic science. But Leibniz was able to explain the physics of optics using Aristotelian final causes in his mathematical descriptions and showed that it worked just as well as the mechanical "billiard ball" kind of causality. Leibniz wanted to see causality as a global, holistic way of existence.

**John Barkhausen:** You've pointed out that the Eastern Orthodox branch of knowledge—the Russians—basically went off with the Aristotelian viewpoint, and the West somehow adopted the Platonic viewpoint. That accounts for our love of modeling instead of gathering empirical evidence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The teleological approach is fully compatible with the evidence-based, historical, fact-centered approach. It just looks at generality and laws in a different way that doesn't insist they are outside of time. It is open to complexity in a way that the essentialist, Platonist approach is not.

## The Evolution of Evolutionary Thought

**John Barkhausen:** How has evolutionary thought developed over the years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Darwin's time, the racist approach tried to explain everything in terms of your existing present biology, which was explained in terms of your genetic nature. It said that how you came to be was a purely random affair, and the only way to change the situation is to select out the inferior—not to improve them, because things essentially aren't open to change. So, what you measure is what was destined from the start.

This leads to either intentional or incidental genocide, in which inferior plants, people, and animals go out of existence simply because improvement isn't possible. It rejects the idea of improving the world.

**John Barkhausen:** Was that ideology expressed before Malthus came along?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it developed as they realized that the moneyed class had better health and everything else. The ideology was intended to keep down the demands of the working classes. Malthus really just codified an ideology, and Darwin, being a member of the upper class, found that compatible.

In contrast, I see Vladimir Vernadsky's use of the Le Chatelier principle. If a system is in equilibrium and you disturb the system, it adjusts itself to come to a new equilibrium. Vernadsky saw the cosmos as an energy system and life as a part of the system that is adjusting the equilibrium as the system is energized from the outside. He saw evolution as having a direction—in a way, it was teleological—because he showed that it would maximize the movement of atoms, the intensity of metabolism in organisms, and the maximization of size, especially of the nervous system and the brain. The flow of energy was giving shape to his system.

**John Barkhausen:** That's what you mean by teleological—purposefulness.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but you think about the equilibrium and the end condition as well as the starting condition. You have to think in terms of a whole system and the interactions through time. There is no place for one of these essential Platonic forms, which Mendel, for example, wanted to identify as "trait genes" so that you could have fixed species. It’s really a very pure religious imposition on pea traits in Mendel's case.

**John Barkhausen:** It seems like the pot calling the kettle black. He insists on these ideal forms, which sounds religious, but he calls the people who believe in purposeful adaptation "vitalists" or superstitious.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people who own the schools, universities, and publishing houses are in a better position to denounce others as frauds. But actually, there is a tremendous amount of fake science hiding among the genetics culture. Eugenics was part of the biological gene culture in the United States. The *Journal of Eugenics*, after Hitler lost the war and was discredited, changed its name to the *Journal of Human Genetics*, but the people didn't change their ideas. They still worshipped the doctrines of Konrad Lorenz, who devised Hitler's genocide rationale.

**John Barkhausen:** He was lauded in this country as a great friendly scientist.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After he got the Nobel Prize, my professors—including the Jewish immigrants who had escaped Europe around 1939—were praising Konrad Lorenz and the very ideas that were published to justify the extermination. In his book published around 1970, he used exactly the same sentences, except he used a slight euphemism instead of "exterminated."

## The Origin of Life: Sidney Fox

**John Barkhausen:** Could you walk us through your conception of the history of evolution from the origin of life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm inclined to see Sidney Fox's approach as being at least a good image or analog of how the process works. He worked in Linus Pauling's lab and was a professor in regular biology departments. His results were very clear, but they didn't resonate with the genetics biological schools.

He did variations on the Urey-Miller experiment (bubbling primitive atmosphere). He cooked ammonia and carbon dioxide in various ways in the presence of hot rocks. He found that protein-like things spontaneously polymerized, and the arrangement was non-random. If he had 8 or 10 amino acids cooking together, the proteins that spontaneously formed on the surface of the hot rocks had a non-random arrangement, as if the amino acids were interacting in such a way that they chose their position according to stability.

With a very small amount of water letting them dry out, and then adding a small amount of water to this hot, spontaneously formed protein, they spontaneously formed little bacteria-like spheres—very uniform in size. These shapes could divide like cells or bud off parts that would then grow up to the bacteria-sized particle. They could "eat" and reproduce.

To a mixture of these amino acids, proteins, and spheres, he found that adding the bases of the nucleic acids caused them to polymerize inside the little bacteria-like particles, forming nucleic acid chain polymers. Again, these were non-randomly arranged, apparently by the nature of the bases themselves and the context of the protein structures around them.

So, the ordering process doesn't require any kind of input up to this stage—neither a divine watchmaker specifying the sequence nor the infinitely long spans of time that the crude Darwinian viewpoint suggested.

**John Barkhausen:** That's amazing. So he just did that by adding amino acids to hot volcanic rock?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He simplified the procedure so that high school students could create life in an hour lab session. It seems like a very plausible way to see the first bacteria coming into existence. If you look at the underwater vents in the ocean—volcanoes spewing material into deep ocean water full of weird organisms—as an analogy to Sidney Fox's experiments, it suggests that you might get something much closer to presently existing organisms just in a matter of minutes or hours when you have extreme pressure and high temperature.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that theory of life developing gaining more acceptance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I mentioned it to my professors in my qualifying exam. None of them had heard about it, even though it was in Lehninger's biochemistry textbook. I looked at the edition that came out in Lehninger's name after he died, and Fox's work had been removed. So I think there was a move away from it after Fox died.

**John Barkhausen:** You wrote in *Generative Energy* that the thought that life forms might just gush up out of the earth in volcanic regions makes it all seem too easy. What do you think they are afraid of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm sure it's the Malthusian and Darwinian hatred of the lower classes—the feeling that if they were given a chance, they would displace the ruling class. It really comes down to politics.

## From Molecules to Organisms

**John Barkhausen:** How do you see life developing from those molecules into actual organisms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Sidney Fox particles could interact with each other. If you have a whole planet full of such things, every time you get something that is a little more stable, this will spread horizontally. It isn't necessarily a matter of descendants, but it will spread its influence by contact with its contemporaries. Things can spread much faster than the idea of inheritance and selection of the fittest.

Bacteria are now known to be able to spread their resistance to antibiotics horizontally. If you have a planet full of these simple things, the tendency is for them to accumulate more and more of the stabilizing, activating structures. I see it as an example of Vernadsky's principle: apply the right pressure and temperature conditions, and the system spontaneously moves in that direction.

I think it was James Shapiro who talked about the bacterial self-engineering of their genetic material. He proposed that the movement from a protozoan-type organism to a multicellular organism could also be almost spontaneous, in which this over-endowed single cell finds a situation where colonizing with its neighbors leads to a new level of metabolism and stability.

## Class Warfare and Metaphysics

**John Barkhausen:** We have a question from a listener named Duncan: "Is it possible to fix the class warfare problem? If so, how? Will the class warfare problem always exist considering inherent human nature?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's essentially a metaphysical problem. Around 1870, William Morris asked, "Where will this culture end?" He answered, "With a counting house on top of a cinder pile." That was very close to the way climate change seems to be leading us—ashes and money.

If you see the mechanical commitment to the past leading its way into the future, you end up with that cinder pile. To avoid that, you have to change your metaphysics to the Leibnizian or Aristotelian view in which the *final cause* has to be taken into account. Leibniz and Teilhard de Chardin saw this endpoint as a God consciousness. Vernadsky described it as a universe of consciousness—the Noosphere—in which knowledge and awareness became the governing principle.

However you see the end condition, I think you have to start thinking in terms of final causes. Once you take into account that maybe it isn't so good to reduce the planet to ashes and money, then maybe you can work on solutions. Part of the solution is to stop thinking about class superiority and racial superiority.

**John Barkhausen:** When you say the end conditions, does that mean you have to imagine how you'd like the world to be and then intend to make it that way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. By denouncing teleological thinking, they said that the bottom line is that you want to make your money and you don't care what it costs the other person or the environment. According to that metaphysics, the outcome is always competitive degradation.

## Anthropology and Environment

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anthropology is an area very closely connected to evolutionary thinking. Despite the fact that academic anthropology in the US has been strongly guided by the CIA, there are evolutionary lines of thinking that are promising.

Margaret Mead's approach was that cultures don't have to be static; people make the culture, so they can change the culture. Her professor, Franz Boas at Columbia, thought of himself as a Darwinist, but when he actually studied the facts, he showed that the environment rather than the genes governed even the person's biology. He measured the heads of Europeans who had moved to New York or Puerto Rico and found that the first-generation offspring had heads shaped more like New Yorkers or Puerto Ricans than like the European parents. It showed the powerful importance of the material and social culture shaping the organism.

## Empathy and Resonance

**John Barkhausen:** Another question from Duncan: "Is empathy evolutionarily advantageous?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see empathy as the universal principle of substance—the absolute opposite of the essentialist view. If you break the world up into Leibnizian monads, the essentialist says that the monads are closed. The existence of empathy implies that each unit of existence is open and interacting with its environment.

I see empathy as expressible in physical terms, such as *resonance*. In the case of empathizing with a person or animal, you tune your nervous system so that it is resonating with the conditions of the other's nervous system. I see it as something that explains why the amino acids take on a non-random arrangement in Fox's molecules. Resonance is a stabilizer on the atomic level, the chemical cellular level, and the organismic level.

**John Barkhausen:** And culturally too, in the form of music and ideas.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Luca Turin is a perfume expert whose theory of psychoactive drugs, hormones, and odor molecules is based on the idea that it's an electronic resonance between the molecule and the cell that accounts for the specificity. He gives examples where molecules that resonate the same have the same smell or biological effect despite having a different shape.

**John Barkhausen:** So, are we basically just an evolution of the actual material we're made out of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the resonant properties are the properties that matter to us. We can substitute molecules that aren't exactly the same in form but have the same electronic way of interacting with us. For example, I would say methylene blue has this remarkable range of biologically valuable functions, even though it's something that we never evolved with. It has an electronic property that fits in and stabilizes or enriches our system.

## Consciousness and Evolution

**John Barkhausen:** There was a book called *Food of the Gods* postulating that our consciousness did a radical shift when we discovered psilocybin mushrooms. What do you think about the evolution of consciousness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think things such as the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, the amount of particular nutrients in the diet, and the balance of amino acids are the main powers of increasing consciousness. But consciousness I see as simply one side of the metabolic interactive process. Anything that increases our quality of metabolism is increasing our ability to resonate with more complex systems. Things like mushrooms act as a lubricant. The organism might have a certain amount of energy available, and with just a little lubricant, it might find that it can slide up to a new metabolic level.

**John Barkhausen:** You've written about Pavlov and Anokhin, the Russian behavioral scientists. Pavlov wrote that life has a biological urge for freedom. Do you believe that is a powerful evolutionary force?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think it fits into the idea of the Noosphere. Pavlov's "reflex of freedom" was also the exploratory reflex—always wanting to find out more. When the culture or planet evolves beyond the urge to accumulate power to the conscious Noosphere level, that reflex will be fully activated. Everything will become a question and an opportunity for discovery.

**John Barkhausen:** You also wrote that health can be seen as the coordination of the levels of evolution.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is analogous to Maslow's steps of development: security, food, social interactions, and finally self-actualization. It might be analogous to the freedom reflex—the opportunity to live for creative action. Carl Rogers was a sophisticated thinker with a phenomenological approach. His understanding of therapy was that it's the interactive attempt of the therapist to listen to and understand the client—it's the resonance in itself which is therapeutic.

## Methylene Blue

**John Barkhausen:** A follow-up on methylene blue from Duncan: "Have you tried methylene blue? How does it feel versus progesterone or caffeine?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've only been using it transdermally. My approach to understanding new chemicals is to find what the smallest amount does and then work up. So far, I see it as a good anti-inflammatory. Quite a few people are having very powerful antidepressant effects from it with just one milligram a day. But I think it's probably going to be effective at doses analogous to thyroid hormone—20, 30, or 40 micrograms per day might be the optimal dose. It's known that it can bypass mitochondrial defects, and I think that's a big part of why it can cure serious depression at such a small dose.

## Russian Science and Lysenko

**John Barkhausen:** I wanted to talk about Russian science. You went there one summer. Did you meet any scientists?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I went to the place where Trofim Lysenko was working. One of his assistants took me around. We also dropped in on Yuri Holodov, who was studying magnetobiology—the influence of magnetic fields on the nervous system. He took the time to talk to us. His first question was, "What are you studying and where?" I said I planned to enroll at the University of Oregon in nerve biology. He immediately asked, "Oh, are you going to work with..." and named a professor who had just left the university that quarter. He was up to the present year in knowing who was doing nerve research in US universities.

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe you could outline what the Lysenko controversy was about.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lysenko never was the "Czar of Genetics." Even at the height of his power under Stalin, he was always criticizing the university genetics people. He ran the state crop improvement stations. It was Lewontin, an American Marxist biologist, who examined the grain production records under Lysenko's influence and found they were actually increasing grain production steadily. The university genetics departments weren't producing anything of value.

We've been given a false history. Lysenko emphasized the predominance of the cytoplasm. The adaptation of the organism involved changes in the organization of the cytoplasm. People in the West were working on similar things with cloning experiments. For example, with a paramecium, if you take a bit of the surface and turn it around so the cilia beat in reverse, the descendants all have the reversed cilia. This shows clear inheritance of things that happen to the cytoplasm.

Barbara McClintock was finding similar things in her work with corn—that stress increased the variability and adaptability of the organism, changing the chromosomes. She came so close to Lysenko and Lamarck in showing that stress changes heredity, and she was hostilely ignored by the profession for 40 years. Then, with genetic engineering, when people wanted to patent new genes, they realized it would be good to have scientific precedent. They resurrected Barbara McClintock's work and gave her the Nobel Prize, but 40 years later.

**John Barkhausen:** Darwin did not rule out many of the mechanisms that Lamarck talked about, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Darwin proposed "gemmules" or "pangenesis"—the idea that something the organism acquired through experience was shed from the organs and reached the gonads to be taken up in the germline. That idea was too Lamarckian for anyone up until Lysenko's time.

But in the last 10 or 20 years, it has been revisited. It can be traced back to a North Korean, Bonghan Kim, who in the 60s showed there were particles carrying nucleic acids through a lymphatic-like system. Only recently have people looked at particles in the plasma called exosomes or microvesicles. These are now known to carry RNA, proteins, and even DNA, and it has been demonstrated that the DNA carried in these particles can be incorporated into the germ cells and transmitted. Basically, Darwin's gemmules are now called exosomes.

## Future Evolution

**John Barkhausen:** We have a question from Prana Rupa: "Would you be willing to speculate about future evolutionary expressions, both at the level of the biosphere and in relation to optimizing our own potentialities?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the increasing carbon dioxide is going in the right direction. I think it increases adaptability, so I don't think we have to worry about carbon dioxide contributing to the extinction of species. The tendency of this increasing carbon dioxide is to support the process of cephalization. So, I think the direction will be bigger brains and further development of the imaginative types of mental processes.

**John Barkhausen:** A question from Todd Mudd: "Are evolutionary steps really spontaneous? Do they happen in a single generation, or are the changes gradual?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it happens intermittently. One woman will have a remarkably advantageous pregnancy and will be the forerunner of a trend. It can happen immediately in one lucky group of organisms and become more widespread when the whole situation is more fortunate.

**John Barkhausen:** Would another evolutionary step have something to do with thinking in images rather than words?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The essentialist metaphysics is literally holding back physiological functioning and evolution. The organism is impaired when it gets stuck in verbal formulas. When the brain is properly energized—Pyotr Anokhin has terms for this—there is a conductive quality to the fluids of the brain which allows a holistic kind of functioning. Any concrete thought or image brings with it an interpretive context. You see the meaning in all of its expanded qualities rather than a symbolic formulation. It is like a simultaneous picture in three dimensions and moving.

**John Barkhausen:** That's fascinating. Is that possibly where we're evolving to—telepathy? You mentioned a talk by Michael Persinger called "No More Secrets."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, he makes some good arguments. He experimented with stimulating the brain to get what he called the "God consciousness." I think that sense of overwhelming meaning is just a natural brain process when it's properly energized. When you think of an atom, you can't think of an abstract atom out of time; every atom has its own history.

**John Barkhausen:** Ray, we are out of time. Thank you so much for offering us your time and knowledge today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
