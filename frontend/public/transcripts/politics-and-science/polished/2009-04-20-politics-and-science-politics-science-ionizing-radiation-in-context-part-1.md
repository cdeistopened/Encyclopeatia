## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to another edition of Politics and Science. Today kicks off a new series about radiation. We'll be discussing nuclear ionizing radiation, focusing on its use in our culture and weighing its potential usefulness in relation to its costs to our health and environment. I'm very happy to have on the show again Dr. Raymond Peat, an endocrinologist, physiologist, and science historian from Eugene, Oregon. You can find more information about Ray Peat on his website, raypeat.com. Ray, welcome back.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, excellent.

**John Barkhausen:** I know you have quite a bit to say about radiation. It’s a confusing subject because often when people talk about radiation—say at the dentist or the doctor's office—they try to make you feel safe about using it. They compare it to other kinds of radiation, like sunlight. They say a bone scan is no more than two days in the sun, or they compare it to a flight from Denver to New York regarding cosmic radiation. Could you address the different kinds of radiation that exist and how they compare?

## The Myth of Safe Radiation

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The medical profession, the government, and the nuclear industry made up a lot of stories to convince people that radiation doesn't hurt them. Sunlight is probably the basic, oldest story: if it doesn't kill you to absorb so much energy of sunlight, why should it kill you to absorb the equivalent of an hour in the form of radiation?

They have known for close to 200 years that there are very different kinds of radiation. In 1800, they knew that the invisible light beyond the blue end of the spectrum was chemically active. They called them "chemical rays" because they could produce changes in silver nitrate and photographic emulsions. They knew the warm rays and colored visible rays were harmless compared to these chemical burning rays which can sunburn you.

At the end of the 19th century, when the Curies and Becquerel were exploring radium, Becquerel carried a vial of it in his pocket and got a horrible burn on his chest. The medical profession immediately saw that as something even more fun than surgery and cautery. When they saw it caused a horrible burn, they decided it was good for medical purposes, like burning off warts.

However, by 1904, Thomas Edison’s main assistant died of X-ray poisoning after years of amputations and burns. So by 1904, Thomas Edison was already an opponent of the use of ionizing radiation in any form. But the medical profession was just starting to see that it was a profitable tool. To sell it, they had a hundred years to invent stories to convince people that they wouldn't get lethal burns. They invented the story that there was a threshold below which no damage at all was done.

**John Barkhausen:** And the government expanded on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, when they wanted to show that they could explode atomic bombs in Nevada and no one would be harmed. Forty years later, Congress investigated and concluded that about 15,000 people minimum in the United States alone were killed as a result of those atmospheric tests. But the government had its agents out convincing people that below the threshold there was no harm at all.

## Cosmic Rays, Altitude, and Linear Energy Transfer

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even Linus Pauling, who opposed exposing the population to radiation, was convinced that it was worse to live in Denver than at sea level because cosmic rays and sunlight were supposedly more intense. However, the facts showed that cancer of all kinds is less common the higher you go in altitude.

Someone as sophisticated as Linus Pauling neglected the property of radiation called **Linear Energy Transfer (LET)**. It happens that cosmic rays at high altitude don't deliver much energy or damage to your tissues. But at lower altitudes, where they are less intense, they are more able to react with your tissues and cause damage. So the cosmic rays are harmful, but when you are in a skyscraper, for example, it's even worse than being at a low altitude because the cosmic rays are slowed down and produce secondary and tertiary particles. You get much more intense radiation at low altitude, sheltered by massive structure.

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe we should back up just a little bit. Why is that the case? It seems like at lower altitudes, if they are going slower, that implies less energy to me. Why does that cause more damage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ordinary photon radiation—infrared, visible light, ultraviolet—is an electromagnetic vibration. Nuclear particles are actual protons, nuclei, or whole atoms minus the electrons. Cosmic rays are typically iron atoms without their electrons. They are very massive particles going at a very high speed. They pass through the body without doing anything except leaving a trail of ionization.

If you use a cloud chamber—humid air adjusted so it is just about to condense into rain—the particles going through it ionize the air and cause nucleation. A streamer of fog appears. Cosmic rays are constantly going through, so you can visualize them. At lower energies, they will even stop in your tissue rather than passing through.

Linear accelerators put this to use; they can adjust the voltage of protons and shoot them into your body at a given energy, designing it so they slow down and stop near a tumor. Where they slow down and stop, they cause the most damage. When they go through quickly, like a cosmic ray at high altitude, they just leave a slight trail of ionization rather than a very intense cloud of secondary reactions.

**John Barkhausen:** So the cosmic rays are worse in a skyscraper because they're being slowed down by hitting the walls?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They cause nuclei to disintegrate into secondary particles, and those particles cause other disintegrations into tertiary particles. It's like a more intense shower of lower energy, but still lethal, particles.

The Chinese did experiments with rabbits, putting them in cages with lead roofs of different thicknesses. Around half an inch to an inch of lead caused the rabbits to fairly quickly become sterile and miscarry. If they were pregnant when put under the roof, they would miscarry just like you were giving them a birth control pill. If you kept them under it, they didn't conceive at all.

**John Barkhausen:** Why was that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Radiation poisoning from tertiary or secondary cosmic rays.

**John Barkhausen:** So the cosmic rays are getting through the lead, which I assumed would block them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At a certain thickness, you maximize the tertiary and secondary particles. There's a certain probability as the lead gets thicker that one of the rays will have a direct hit on the nucleus and cause it to split into more particles.

## Systemic Effects of Radiation

**John Barkhausen:** And it's making them sterile because it's adding stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With a shorter dose, the litter would simply be reduced in weight, some animals would be dead, and others would survive. Even though that was particles, when the lead nuclei split, you get some gamma rays and X-rays produced as well.

A study of dentistry in Seattle looked at a large population of people getting different types of dental work. They used lead shields to cover the body so only the face was getting the X-ray. But when they looked at the results, a pregnant woman who got a full set of oral X-rays could expect to have a lighter birth weight baby as a result of the systemic poisoning produced by X-raying just her head.

**John Barkhausen:** That makes cosmic rays and X-rays sound somewhat equivalent biologically.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In biological effect, yes. They are equivalent to poisoning and stress. In my dissertation work, I looked through the biological effects of different kinds of radiation and found that I couldn't distinguish the biological damage caused by overdosing estrogen from the radiation poisoning effects. It's a very general type of biological damage.

Many biologists thought radiation caused the pituitary gland to make the ovaries overproduce estrogen because the radiation was so identical to estrogen poisoning. But people did control experiments; they irradiated just the head, and the whole animal would show an estrogen effect. Others X-rayed only a foot or an arm, and still the whole body went into an estrogenic state, showing that it's a toxin produced by any tissue interacting with the radiation.

**John Barkhausen:** So you don't have to target an area; it affects the whole animal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it spreads through the bloodstream and probably in other ways.

## Medical X-Rays and Brain Damage

**John Barkhausen:** X-rays are widely used medically—dental X-rays, CAT scans, bone scans. Doctors say they're invaluable. Besides the estrogenic effect, what else do they do to your tissues?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The estrogenic effect is just part of a general type of tissue excitation that involves chronic inflammation. Depending on the dose and time, that leads to tissue atrophy and fibrosis. The atrophy and fibrosis are what predispose you eventually to cancerization.

At first, the U.S. government sponsored interpretations of the atomic bomb radiation in Japan. They drew circles around the bomb and looked at people at one mile, ten miles, and so on. But the radiation went with the wind. When they took the people who really got the radiation in one part of the radius and averaged it out with the people at the same distance but in totally different directions, they made the radiation damage disappear.

When people more honestly looked at the data, they found that 20 years later, people who had been exposed as babies or fetuses had brains much smaller than normal. This is the same effect seen in the Chinese rabbit studies.

**John Barkhausen:** And with the women in the dental study?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they actually measured their heads, and the whole head was smaller if they were exposed *in utero*. That amount of radiation was being used medically for a long time in the U.S. Alice Stewart showed that it was causing more leukemia and other childhood cancers, but no one has traced brain damage to medical X-rays yet, even though it has been established in other countries.

## Internal Emitters and the Bystander Effect

**John Barkhausen:** You spoke of nuclear atmospheric tests. X-rays are waves, but I imagine anything carried by the wind is a radioactive particle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and those particles get ingested. It isn't that they radiate at you from the dust outside, but they get in your food, water, and air. They enter your body as a food atom. Then they follow the course of nuclear decay inside your tissues.

If a particle emits an alpha particle (a helium nucleus) right inside the cell, it causes total damage and is absorbed within just a few cell diameters. The nuclear industry used to say, "Why worry about alpha particles?" They would show that a sheet of paper stops the beam between an emitter and a detector. But the difference is, when you have ingested the particle, there is no paper between the particle and the cell that gets poisoned.

**John Barkhausen:** So every time a nuclear facility has a leak, particles are being emitted?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And people breathe them in. Just two or three years ago, someone compared the blood serum of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. They demonstrated lingering photochemical emission differences in their blood serum 60 years after the exposure.

**John Barkhausen:** It lingers that long? Are there still radioactive particles in them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it's unstable biochemical material. It spreads the influence and persists unless something intervenes to correct the process.

This is something that has come up in the last 10 years: the **bystander effect**. If you irradiate cells in a dish to produce mutations and then put those cells with unexposed cells in another dish, those unexposed cells keep mutating long after, due to something emitted by the irradiated cells. If you irradiate fish, they will emit toxic materials into the water that cause biochemical disturbances in other fish.

The genetic instability is the most horrifying part. It is transmitted as a signal from the injured cell, which then injures the receiving cells. That transmitted effect destabilizes the chromosomes generations later. In the lab, it can be passed through many generations of cells as a tendency to mutate.

## Children and Developmental Susceptibility

**John Barkhausen:** There was a study in Germany showing a higher leukemia rate among children around nuclear power plants. Why are young living things more susceptible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The "genetics dogma" was used by physics dogma to say that if it didn't mutate your DNA, it didn't cause damage. But the bystander effect is produced by doses in the micro-gray region—a millionth of a gray—whereas they used to call 50 gray the toxic dose.

The developing organism is never simply a genetic blueprint being read out. Doctors used to say that as long as a mother ate enough to live, the baby wouldn't be affected by her poverty. That was based on the doctrine that genes determine everything. But in fact, even the formation of the ovum is environmentally determined by the mother's physiology. Once the fertilized egg starts developing, it is modified at every stage by its environment.

If estrogen is introduced during pregnancy—even a small dose—it changes the environment. For example, the cortex of the brain is thinner in proportion to estrogen exposure. The radiation exposure caused the whole brain to be smaller, but a seemingly insignificant imbalance towards estrogen causes the cortex to be thinner than normal. Because the young organism is in a developmental state, if you introduce inflammation and stress, there will be more deviation from its ideal possibilities.

**John Barkhausen:** So it sounds like it's a good idea to avoid any kind of radiation exposure, including dental X-rays.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. But even the time of day can influence your ability to tolerate stresses. If you go for a jog before breakfast, your chromosomes are going to be more susceptible to breakage than if you had some juice first. Low blood sugar makes your chromosomes break more easily. Having your radiation injury in the late afternoon, you're going to have much less risk of damage.

## Diagnostic Efficacy and Alternatives

**John Barkhausen:** What about the efficacy of using medical radiation for diagnosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One article published in JAMA about 10 years ago criticized the use of bone scans. They showed they were thrown off by any consistent change in the ratio of fat and water. Fat doesn't absorb X-rays as much as water does. If you reduce the fat in your bone marrow—which is normally fat-rich—and exchange it for water (which estrogen can do), you seem to have more dense bones. So, especially for measuring the effects of estrogen, X-ray bone scans are simply not scientific.

There are ultrasound bone measuring devices that determine the strength of the bone from the elastic sound transmission. It measures bone quality, not just density. Incidentally, each ultrasound treatment is likely to make your bones stronger because it stimulates healing, whereas each X-ray exposure increases stress and makes bones weaker.

**John Barkhausen:** What about CAT scans? *Newsweek* was cautionary about people having too many.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One is too many. It's a lot of radiation—the equivalent of many, many chest X-rays.

**John Barkhausen:** Is there any time when you think an X-ray would be a useful tool?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, because the other technologies are better. Magnetic resonance (MRI) and ultrasound. The technology is there, and it would be improved if people would start using it more. But they are invested in their present machines.

## John Gofman and Medical Responsibility

**John Barkhausen:** Can you say a few words about John Gofman?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was aware of him from the 1940s on as one of the main government "devils." For 30 years, he said how wonderful X-rays were and that they weren't known to be harmful. He claimed you couldn't prove bomb tests would kill people. He called people like Linus Pauling irresponsible fear mongers.

Around 1968, in the middle of a speech where he was saying it hadn't been proved that bomb tests would result in death and disease, he suddenly realized what he was saying. He said he realized he was stupid or crazy to be saying such stuff. Once he did, he became the government's greatest enemy. His last big book demonstrated that breast cancer and heart disease in the United States are caused mainly by medical X-rays.

**John Barkhausen:** That's very similar to what Samuel Epstein says about mammography.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There was a study in Scandinavia a few years ago that showed total mortality was higher in women who got breast scans.

**John Barkhausen:** I recently heard of a metal pellet being planted during a biopsy without the patient's knowledge to mark the spot. How does that strike you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's not an abnormal medical technique. Did you hear the NPR program broadcasting Columbia Medical School's "blessing of the white coat" ceremony? They bless the white coats and have students put them on like they're getting a diploma. It's an attitude that physicians are sanctified by their profession, so they feel they can't do any harm if they are sincerely being physicians. What I hear are mostly horror stories—women told they are having exploratory surgery and then their ovaries are removed.

## Food Irradiation

**John Barkhausen:** One thing they are using ionizing radiation for now is irradiated food. They irradiate meat and fruit. What is your opinion on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It almost instantly spoils it to some extent, but it stops other enzyme and bacterial changes. It kills enough microorganisms to stop some rotting, but it also stops the natural defense processes. Apples will instantly turn color and get soft and sour.

It activates aging processes in meat; proteins are degraded into toxic compounds, and fats are made rancid. Every component is affected in proportion to its oxidizability. When they feed these processed foods to experimental animals, the animals show effects of poisoning and malnutrition. Vitamin B2, folic acid, and Vitamin A are almost totally destroyed.

At the same time, the destruction converts them into toxic reactive compounds. You can test food to show if it has been irradiated using the same tests that show lingering radiation damage in people: photochemical luminescence. The breakdown of fats causes photoluminescence. If it was an animal—oysters, chickens, fish—the bones capture the excited electrons. If you dissolve the bone in a light-detecting device, irradiated foods will luminesce.

**John Barkhausen:** Is oxidation just a side effect, or is that what's really going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To the extent that there is something present to receive the excited electrons, they will react, and you will have oxidation happening. Even ultraviolet light can cause processes like that. If you get too much UV from the sun, the Vitamin B2 in your skin can get into an excited state. If you have eaten a lot of polyunsaturated fats, the excited Vitamin B2 can extract electrons from the exposed double bonds on the fats, create breakage, and spread an oxidizing process that attacks DNA.

**John Barkhausen:** So that's how you get skin cancer from ultraviolet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The wrinkles and cancerization process from sunlight highly correspond to the amount of polyunsaturated fat in your diet.

## Protection and Mitigation

**John Barkhausen:** We have a few minutes left. What can people do if they have to go to the dentist and get an X-ray? How can they protect themselves?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing is to really reconsider why you need it. Dentists often think their insurance requires the X-ray record. Endodontists say you can't do a root canal without one, but I have talked to some who were proud they didn't need X-rays. It's a matter of skill and judgment.

If you are determined to get an X-ray:
1.  **Timing:** Try to schedule it in the late afternoon in the summer.
2.  **Blood Sugar:** Have your blood sugar steady and high enough. Have some gelatinous soup, orange juice, and milk ahead of time.
3.  **Hormones:** Make sure your hormonal situation is adequate; you don't want estrogen effects interacting with radiation effects. Progesterone treatment has been found to protect against X-ray damage to some tissues. Thyroid is probably the most protective single thing.
4.  **Magnesium:** You need steady blood sugar to keep magnesium in your cells. Have magnesium-rich food before and after.
5.  **Coffee:** Coffee is protective against all kinds of radiation. The caffeine is the main factor, but coffee is also a good source of magnesium and niacin.
6.  **Supplements:** Niacinamide is a general tissue protector against stress. The antioxidants Vitamin E, Vitamin K, and ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) are also protective.

**John Barkhausen:** Thank you very much, Dr. Peat, for coming on again and for your work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, very good. Bye.
