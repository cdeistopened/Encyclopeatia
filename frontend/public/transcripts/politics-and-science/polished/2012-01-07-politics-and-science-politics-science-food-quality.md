## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** This week I'm once again very pleased to have on my show Dr. Raymond Peat, who has a PhD in biology and has studied extensively in the fields of physiology and endocrinology. In my opinion, he is a very learned science historian.

This show is inspired by two articles Ray Peat wrote: "Milk in Context: Allergies, Ecology, and Some Myths" and "Vegetables, etc.—Who Defines Food?" Both take on the issue of the quality of our food and how it has evolved—or devolved—over the years. Today I'd like to discuss how our culture, food production processes, and environment have influenced these changes. Ray, you wrote that good nutrition involves much more than essential nutrients. How do we decide what is nutritious, and how are these decisions made now compared to traditionally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Traditionally, people would eat something that tasted good. If they survived and stayed healthy, their families and descendants would keep eating it. Each area evolved pretty safe mixtures of foods. But as soon as organization got involved—pharaohs, kings, dukes, and eventually corporations—they decided people should eat what gave them the best profit. The health of the people varied according to the convenience of who was in charge of the economy.

Since World War II—well, the Germans really started it in the First World War when they were blockaded. They had an advanced chemical industry and started learning how to make substitute materials for war and civilian survival. By the Second World War, they had developed pretty good imitation foods. For example, they fed their Russian prisoners of war on sawdust bread that resembled bread but had no nutritional value.

The FDA saw the success of that and decided to agree with the corporations. Even though in the 1940s they had said that gums weren't decent for human consumption because they produced biological damage, they finally agreed it was okay to add fillers like sawdust, cellulose, seaweed gum, and various tree gums. A baker recently said that he hadn't realized he could make a good loaf of bread with 18% sawdust.

## Industrial Fillers and Waste Products

**John Barkhausen:** That's astounding. I remember when the fiber craze hit the general culture. There were breads in our supermarket advertising extra fiber, and in the ingredients, was sawdust.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Now I think they have a more diplomatic way of saying that. They call it "nutritional fiber." Anytime there's a pleasant-sounding, unfamiliar ingredient in the food, it's probably a waste product from industry. For example, chitin and various waste products from the shrimp industry are now used in food and health foods. If you look at each industry and see what they had a problem getting rid of, you'll see the food technologists learning how to make people eat it.

**John Barkhausen:** So the food waste just gets recycled into the system again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. The EPA was receiving complaints about insect infestation and the mountains of pulp waste from the orange juice industry. They told the industry to do something with their horrendous quantities of pulp. By using microbial enzymes, they found they could make it water-soluble and create creamy, pulpy, fibrous orange juice. But it happens to be a chemical that would never occur in the natural fruit, and it has very unpredictable health results in the intestine because it's something people would never have been exposed to naturally.

The fish industry had a similar interaction with the EPA. They were either dumping their fish processing waste into the ocean or hauling it inland for landfill, but it was so stinky the EPA told them to find other ways to dispose of it. That's where they came up with fish protein powders for famine areas or food additives, and fish oil—the fat and oil and protein used in health foods.

**John Barkhausen:** The saying I've heard is, "The solution to pollution is distribution." This brings us back to convincing people to eat things as food when they otherwise might not think it is. One culture will eat something that's completely abhorrent to another. For example, they eat insects in Africa and consider them a delicacy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once when I was visiting friends in Mexico, I ate with them and there was a nice little thing that was sort of like a salmon cake patty—a mildly fishy tasting thing. I asked what it was, and they said they would tell me after I finished. It was a mosquito cake made of mosquito larvae.

**John Barkhausen:** You're kidding. They can skim off enough larvae to make a cake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have very fine nets especially for them. It was in the eastern side near Xalapa.

**John Barkhausen:** How did that sit in your stomach after you learned what it was?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very well. It tasted just like eating a salmon patty.

## Defining Food and Artificial Flavors

**John Barkhausen:** How do we decide what food is? It sounds like you're saying that we're told at this point what is food and what isn't, and our instincts aren't really working.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the thought process. One of the ugliest Mexican food products is the fungus-infected corn kernel that makes a big blue swelling on the corn cob. It's a mushroom growing in the corn, but it stimulates a tumor in the corn, so it's somewhere between a tumor and a fungus. But it makes a very pleasant, semi-mushroom tasting material. It is a traditional food from a very old source that occurs spontaneously, but I guess they can infect corn to make it industrially now.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you feel like a lot of the foods that we eat now are influenced by industrial marketing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost entirely. About 40 or 50 years ago, I read that the food industry had been testing various things against their panel of experts. They found that the public taste preferred artificial flavors over real flavors in things like ice cream, after they had been so trained.

**John Barkhausen:** Since you mentioned ice cream, I know that at one time the ice cream lobby obtained an exemption from the law regarding declaring ingredients. They can say "artificial flavors" and it's basically a bunch of chemicals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's still the general practice. Worse than that, they don't even have to mention on the label something which is actually present if it was mostly removed. They call it a "processing aid" or "incidental ingredient." Even though they intended to remove the bulk of it, some of it is there and can cause allergic or toxic reactions, but they don't have to list it.

Even if everyone is following those extremely useless rules of the FDA, apparently the industry doesn't take the FDA very seriously. I've bought vanilla ice cream from companies that claimed "all natural ingredients." Sometimes it would have a very intense strawberry flavor. Other times, the vanilla ice cream didn't have the black flecks but was dark brown, chocolate-colored, yet absolutely vanilla tasting. That proved they use brown coloring, pink coloring, and artificial flavoring instead of the natural ingredients they claim.

## Gums, Additives, and Inflammation

**John Barkhausen:** A lot of ice cream makers use thickeners like carrageenan, locust bean gum, and guar gum. Many people have allergic reactions to foods; could these gums be the cause rather than the milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The FDA recognized that problem 60 years ago, and the literature is full of published reactions to all of those gums. Carrageenan and alginate from seaweed are probably the worst. Carrageenan is recognized to be carcinogenic to the intestine and liver and to produce inflammation. It's a standard lab method for producing arthritis or inflammation of any organ they want to study.

The assumption is that if it only irritates the intestine and causes cancer in the liver, that is tolerable. But they are neglecting that these particles are passed through the intestine. When a person is under stress, bacteria and larger particles—up to the size of a red blood cell—can go right from the intestine into the bloodstream. The immune system then has direct interaction with them.

Small additives aren't going to stay entirely in the intestine. For example, particles of silicon dioxide—which people say is just harmless sand—are used to create viscous consistency in cosmetics, soaps, and foods. It's basically a very finely powdered glass. At a certain size, they very easily go from the blood into tissue cells and cause sensitization. Scleroderma is probably the most common thing caused by the silica reaction.

**John Barkhausen:** In your newsletter, you mentioned carrageenan causes a pseudo-latex allergy reaction. Can you talk about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the arguments is that in its undegraded form, fresh out of the seaweed, carrageenan doesn't cause cancer. But when you eat it, bacteria in the intestine break it down. The broken-down form of carrageenan is recognized as carcinogenic. Regulatory agencies reveal they are serving industry convenience rather than protecting the public by ignoring this.

The reaction to latex is a general phenomenon. Plants have defense reactions. When a bug bites a plant, it expresses an enzyme called chitinase to dissolve the bug. When you stress a plant—by growing it in a monoculture or forcing it with unbalanced fertilizers—it increases these defensive toxins. A plant growing in the wild might not be allergenic, but once cultivated under extreme conditions, it will produce things such as toxic latex.

**John Barkhausen:** So people are allergic to latex because the plant is producing a toxic chemical to protect itself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Bananas and rubber trees were the first identified with this cross-reaction. People who have a reaction to surgical gloves often have a reaction to bananas. Those people will likely react to other industrialized fruits, like kiwis. They are recognizing that a person allergic to bananas is likely to be allergic to several other similar, industrialized fruits.

## Estrogen, Stress, and Meat Glue

**John Barkhausen:** Why are some people affected by those plant toxins and others not?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The person who is under stress is more susceptible. Estrogen induces a similar protein in humans. Things like estrogen, which intensify the stress reaction, are increasing in industrialized populations. The biological function of estrogen is to stress and activate tissues to get them growing quickly. But when we are chronically exposed to industrial estrogens, it activates our stress reactions in the intestine, making it more permeable.

It also activates enzymes in the intestine that overlap with the gluten molecule. Our immune system, reacting to an overdose of estrogen, doesn't distinguish that from gluten. So, gluten interacts with chronic estrogen exposure to produce serious chronic inflammatory symptoms.

That enzyme happens to be a cross-linker. When extracted from microorganisms, it can be used to tie any protein together. The food industry uses this enzyme to make artificial fish and meat products. If you order a fish patty at a fast-food restaurant, you're probably getting a mixture of seaweed gum and fish waste fragments glued together with this enzyme. It's known as "restructured meat."

We accidentally ate squid patties once. I cooked two of them, and they shrank from about five inches across down to the size of a silver dollar. We got really sick. I found out they use seaweed jelly (alginate or carrageenan) and grind up waste products into a mush, then add the cross-linking enzyme to coagulate it.

**John Barkhausen:** I suspect that is how they achieve the uniform look of deli hams and turkey loaves.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And in studies comparing various foods, processed meats are consistently one of the most carcinogenic categories.

## Aging Meat and Carcinogens

**John Barkhausen:** Those meats are also full of additives and preservatives.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and the aging process itself. They add deodorants to change the smell of aged meat, but the practice of aging meat probably makes it more carcinogenic. When meat starts to rot, the odor chemicals are polyamines—specifically cadaverine and putrescine. These stimulate cell growth and are connected with cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** Around here, people raise their own cattle and hang them for about five days at 40 degrees to make the meat tender and flavorful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It definitely gets more flavor, but that's mostly advertising. I eat more meat when I'm in Mexico because it tastes better. In small towns without refrigerators, they sell it off the carcass within the first few days. It always tastes really fresh. In US supermarkets, food technologists say it gets tender after two weeks, so they don't sell it before then. But by then, it develops putrescine, spermidine, and cadaverine, which are mildly toxic and possibly carcinogenic.

**John Barkhausen:** I thought Europe was averse to chemical treatment of animals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are, but recently there has been evidence that they're treating living animals with big doses of glucocorticosteroids to break down the fiber while they're alive to tenderize the meat. Even though rules are in place, you can't trust anything from a big corporation because the FDA is doing its best to look the other way.

## Agricultural Practices and Plant Toxins

**John Barkhausen:** You said growing crops in monoculture makes plants produce more toxic chemicals. Is there a better way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the plant grows more slowly, the soil will more naturally release chemicals the plant can select from. When growers add chemicals to stimulate fast maturation, it distorts the physiology of the plant.

There have been experiments where corn was fertilized heavily with potassium in one case and phosphate in another. The potassium fertilizer caused the plants to emphasize their tassels (male parts), and the phosphate fertilizer made them overproduce the cob (female parts). You can change the sex ratio of the plant just by pushing one fertilizer. Since the plant's physiology is warped, it produces toxic chemicals defensively.

Roots generally have fewer defensive toxic chemicals because they defend against fungus and bacteria in the ground. The upper parts—leaves, stems, and seeds—defend against grazing animals and insects. So, the worst toxins are in the leaves and seeds. Fruits are evolved to be delicious and non-toxic to encourage animals to spread the seeds. Therefore, fruits are almost always the safest part, roots are second safest, seeds are the worst, and leaves are intermediate.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that why so many people have an intolerance to gluten and flour products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Storage proteins in seeds pack nitrogen into a small space. Those proteins also have the added benefit to the plant of being irritating, indigestible, or toxic to predators.

**John Barkhausen:** What is your take on the effect of genetic engineering on food quality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The most common thing is to put an insecticide protein into the plant. People and animals are known to react allergically to a strange protein that wasn't there before. Allergy is the main thing to worry about with meddling with the genetic composition of plants.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA) and Fish Oil

**John Barkhausen:** Allergies seem to be on the rise. What is your take on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All major allergic symptoms are increasing. Some studies show that unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in a woman's diet when she's pregnant seriously increase the allergies of the baby.

**John Barkhausen:** Can you explain that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Seeds have more omega-6 fats, which are a little more stable. The omega-3s are often in leaves or algae in the ocean (fish oils). These are highly unstable.

A French group decided that since the adult brain contains fish oil-like fats, babies weren't getting enough. They set up an experiment to demonstrate they could make the fetus learn faster by feeding the mother fish oil. What they found was that nervous function was impaired in the women who ate the fish oil. Other studies showed the babies would be more allergic. The babies were also smaller, implying their brains and bodies grew less, probably because of the anti-progesterone effect of the fish oil. A population with suppressed progesterone and thyroid is going to be a more allergic, stressed population.

**John Barkhausen:** You're saying fish oil is included in the same category as vegetable oils like safflower and cottonseed oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A big difference is that the seed oils (omega-6) have a tail of five saturated carbon atoms, making them slightly more stable. Fish oils (omega-3) have only two stable carbons at the end, so they oxidize much more easily.

## Safe Foods and Conclusion

**John Barkhausen:** In the few minutes we have left, what foods should people be focusing on for pleasure and health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruits, if you know they're grown in a safe environment. It's hard to find ripe fruit in stores, but ripe oranges or tangerines are very safe. Eggs are safe if you can find ones that weren't fed linseed or soy oil, which gives them a fishy taste. Just go by the taste. Sweet oranges, eggs that taste like eggs, and meats that taste fresh.

With milk, it's important to judge the taste because of the different feeds cows get. Even organic milk can be allergenic if the cow is eating allergenic weeds.

**John Barkhausen:** What about cheese?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to be cautious because they are putting seaweed and other gums in them to increase water content. They can add 30% to the weight just by putting more jelly in it. I used to eat a Wisconsin Parmesan, but suddenly it got soft and moist and caused bowel inflammation. Now I use real Parmigiano-Reggiano or strange ethnic cheeses from Greece or Italy that still use traditional methods.

**John Barkhausen:** We found a Greek strained yogurt called Fage recently that seems good.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it seems they've got most of the lactic acid out of it. The main thing wrong with ordinary yogurt is that it has lots of lactic acid, so it's basically the same as cottage cheese regarding safety. If you can strain the lactic acid, it's a good food.

**John Barkhausen:** You don't think it's a good idea to eat extra lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It should be minimized. That's why I don't advocate aerobic exercise. I think I'm going to do a newsletter on the role of lactic acid in cancerization. It also promotes inflammation, fibrosis, and degenerative diseases.

**John Barkhausen:** Well, I look forward to that newsletter. Ray, thanks so much for coming on Politics and Science today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
