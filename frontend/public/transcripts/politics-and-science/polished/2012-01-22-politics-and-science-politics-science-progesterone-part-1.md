## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Hi, everyone. The following show with Dr. Raymond Peat was recorded on January 22, 2012. It's about progesterone. Welcome to *Politics and Science*. I'm your host, John Barkhausen. Today, once again, I'm delighted to say that Ray Peat is here to join me. Dr. Peat has a PhD in biology and has done extensive research in the fields of physiology and endocrinology. Is that enough, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, that's enough.

**John Barkhausen:** I was just saying that we've never really touched on the subject of progesterone in a pure form. I was looking back through your newsletters on your website, raypeat.com. What percent of your letters are up there at this point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have written 300 and some, and I think there are only about 75 on the website, so about a quarter. The search device on the website helps to find them. If you put in "progesterone," you'll find lots of newsletters that talk about it.

## Sunlight, Seasons, and Hormones

**John Barkhausen:** I thought maybe we could start the show just talking about how you first got interested in progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been writing about it somewhat in the 70s, but the Proposition 65 thing in California, calling it a carcinogen, was the occasion for me writing a new bunch of newsletters a few years ago.

Before I came to Oregon, I had been studying linguistics. Moving from Mexico to Montana and then Oregon, I noticed a great change in the way my health worked and realized that it was the absence of sunlight—dark, cloudy weather. I saw the same thing happening to all the women I knew during the winter. They would get PMS and what I called "winter sickness."

At that time, I was aware of old experiments where people noticed that sparrows in Times Square mated all year round because of the bright light. In other species, the embryo is formed but doesn't implant in the uterus until the progesterone reaches a certain level. A certain day length of light exposure raises the progesterone and allows fertility to proceed.

I noticed that during bright, sunny, long days, my vitamin A requirement increased tremendously. I came to understand that the sex hormones go up in the spring with long hours of light. Vitamin A is massively used in producing pregnenolone and progesterone. Right at the beginning of moving to Oregon, I was seeing that progesterone and daylight were very powerful on the emotions and body functions. Premenstrual mood changes were evident even in men; typically, men coming from a sunny climate would be depressed all winter living in cloudy Oregon.

**John Barkhausen:** How did you link sunlight to progesterone? Was it something that was already discovered?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One night I went to sleep reading a book with a bright light shining in my face. I woke up starting to get pimples. I realized that the light shining on my eyes, activating my brain, had done something to affect my metabolism. As I read to understand how the light affected my skin, I ran across the winter fertility of sparrows and the springtime implantation of animals. I realized that everyone from birds to men experience the driving of their hormones by day length. The first steroid made is either pregnenolone or progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think there's an adjustment made whereby even with less light you can produce progesterone, or are all of us in the north depressed for that reason?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We just get used to being depressed. If you look at Scandinavian movies, you see that depression seems to be the rule.

## Academic Research and Dogma

**John Barkhausen:** When did you become aware that progesterone was useful therapeutically for cancer and other things?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was intending to study nerve biology. The very first few weeks at the university, I realized what dogmatists the brain and nerve biology people were. So I went looking around, poking into all the labs, and saw that the reproductive physiology people were open-minded and actually studying things rather than trying to confirm their dogma. I immediately switched over from nerve biology to reproductive biology.

**John Barkhausen:** What gave it away that they were open-minded?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Talking to the nerve biology people, their personalities were absolutely militaristic, rigid, and close-minded. The money went along with that—big research grants. The reproductive physiology had grants but very low prestige in the department. People were very relaxed and had a willingness to learn.

Arnold Soderwall was the person in charge of the female reproductive end. Soderwall was the link with previous students, continuing a tradition that started in the 30s and 40s. There were three graduate students working in the lab. Bev Stockton was working on implantation, which involved an age-related delay in the production of progesterone. Terry Parkening later shifted over to see that falling progesterone and excess estrogen were essential changes of aging infertility. I was working on the oxidative changes in the aging reproductive system.

As I worked with the chemicals, I noticed that handling progesterone cured my tendency to have hangnails. Being careless in the lab and getting some of the progesterone on my hands, I noticed that my hangnails disappeared and have never come back.

## Progesterone in Men and Fertility

**John Barkhausen:** So even though it's considered to be somewhat of a female hormone, it also has an important role in males as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Two different groups observed that an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception often caused systemic health problems related to falling progesterone. Animal studies showed that if you put a slight wound into the uterus, signals travel up to the ovary and block the production of progesterone, because the system recognizes that it isn't wise to get pregnant when you have a wounded uterus.

At the same time, another group found that men who had a vasectomy often suffered very serious effects, like impotency. They found that these men had very low progesterone. Replacing their progesterone levels up to normal cured their symptoms. Very often just one dose was all that was needed to start the ovaries in women or the gonads in the man to begin producing the normal amount.

**John Barkhausen:** And of course, you've mentioned before that progesterone is the hormone of fertility that promotes life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the basic implantation stabilizer. Estrogen creates a release of histamine throughout the body, but especially where it's concentrated in the uterus. The histamine creates a site of inflammation. That inflammation prevents survival of the implanted embryo. Progesterone turns off the histamine and estrogen and makes it possible to deliver oxygen and sugar to the implanted embryo. It's the shift towards oxygen and sugar delivery that makes progesterone the preserver of pregnancy.

Interestingly, people have removed animals' ovaries at the time of fertilization and given them different hormones. They found that testosterone worked to preserve pregnancy by delivering oxygen and sugar to the implanted embryo. So you could say that testosterone is a progestin in the sense of supporting pregnancy.

The term "progestins" or "progestogens" implies that these chemicals act to preserve pregnancy the way progesterone does. But in fact, the synthetic so-called progestins are used in birth control pills exactly because they *don't* support pregnancy. They've got the naming system very confused; testosterone functions potentially as a progestin, while the so-called progestins are really anti-progestational chemicals.

**John Barkhausen:** It does seem bizarre that estrogen is considered to be the female hormone when that's actually the hormone of infertility and abortions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The estrogen industry contributed to that. It was known from the late 1930s that estrogen is an abortifacient—it kills the embryo. The industry didn't want their product known to be killing embryos, so they claimed that it stopped ovulation. That was invented just in time for them to come on the market with birth control pills. It was a complete fabrication.

Progesterone turned out to be such a basic, simple substance—the first steroid made out of cholesterol—that only that single molecule has those functions. In the 1930s, they discovered that soot could be extracted to form almost an infinite number of estrogenic substances, allowing the industry to patent various synthetics. They wanted the idea that it was a female hormone for sales purposes. However, it was known that estrogen is actually essential for male traits to develop. Testosterone has to turn into estrogen before it androgenizes the brain. So estrogen could be called the male hormone better than the female hormone because it causes hair growth.

## The Corpus Luteum and Aging

**John Barkhausen:** Looking back at science history, when was progesterone discovered and how has it been used?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 30s the molecule was identified. Armour was the company that made the corpus luteum powder from pregnant pigs. I think I was probably one of the early progesterone babies, my mother having been infertile and taking the Armour corpus luteum product.

**John Barkhausen:** What is the corpus luteum?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the follicle ovulates, that area turns into steroid-producing cells and progesterone becomes the main steroid produced. In humans, that is the basic source of progesterone for the first nine or ten weeks of pregnancy. With each pregnancy, some of those cells remain in the ovary. So a woman who has been pregnant eight times will have higher residual progesterone levels and will live much longer on average than a woman who hasn't had so many pregnancies.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that perhaps why some women who get fibroids notice that the fibroids go away if they get pregnant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone was recommended for many years for treating fibroids. Partly that involves increased thyroid function. Progesterone is needed for the thyroid to work, and the thyroid working causes the liver to lower the estrogen level systemically. Sometimes just one dose of progesterone is all it takes to free the thyroid to function, stimulate new progesterone synthesis, and lower estrogen.

**John Barkhausen:** You've talked before about estrogen and progesterone opposing each other.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen's first action is to block the use of oxygen, which causes the cell to take up water. Overloading cells with water causes them to go into a growth inflammation state where they start multiplying. If that exposure continues, you increase the risk of breast and pituitary tumors. When birth control pills were first on the market in the 1960s with big doses of estrogen, there was a terrific epidemic of pituitary tumors producing prolactin.

## Synthetic vs. Natural Progesterone

**John Barkhausen:** How was progesterone used therapeutically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s, Russell Marker devised a way to make it from the yam steroid, making it cheap. But the drug companies created synthetic forms that could be patented. They argued that real progesterone is destroyed in the stomach, so you have to take their synthetic product. They convinced doctors that natural progesterone didn't work orally, even though companies were selling tablets that worked fine.

One of the problems was that it's extremely insoluble. The only way you can market an injectable product is to use a solvent like benzyl benzoate or benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol is a nerve toxin, but progesterone's powerfully detoxifying effects overrode those poisonous effects.

Katharina Dalton's results were amazing. She treated premenstrual syndrome, which was related to the tendency to miscarry. She gave injections to cure the PMS and continued giving them during pregnancy. Her patients' babies, who usually came from working-class backgrounds with average IQs of 90, tended to average 130 IQ after progesterone treatment. The intelligence of the babies corresponded to the amount of progesterone she gave the mothers.

## Estrogen Deficiency and Inflammation

**John Barkhausen:** What did you do after you left the lab?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was doing nutrition consulting. I was hoping that doctors would come to understand why they shouldn't give estrogen. There's really no such thing as an estrogen deficiency. Any tissue that's injured will become a source of estrogen production. The absence of estrogen in the bloodstream often means there's an excess of estrogen inside cells. Progesterone causes the estrogen to be released from inside cells into the bloodstream where it can be eliminated.

The more a tissue is injured or aged, the more likely it is to have aromatase inside making estrogen. An injured breast, an injured uterus, or fat tissue all become sources of estrogen.

**John Barkhausen:** So as we get older, we're all producing more estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A person tends to lose muscle and bone and replace it with fat and connective tissue. Those tissues become sources of inflammatory materials and estrogen. Progesterone inactivates the enzymes that cause tissues to catch estrogen and activates the enzymes that send estrogen back out.

## Therapeutic Success Stories

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What got me started recommending it directly to people was a 52-year-old woman who had been epileptic from the age of 35. A neurologist had given her anti-seizure drugs for migraines, which made her unable to teach school. When she stopped the drugs, she had actual seizures. By the time I saw her, she was considered hopelessly demented.

I told her about the transdermal use of progesterone. She had inflamed, arthritic fingers, so she dipped her fingers in a beaker of progesterone oil. Four or five days later, her fingers were not arthritic anymore, she felt fine, and she could find her way home. She enrolled back in the university and got her master's degree with straight A's. Her seizures stopped completely.

**John Barkhausen:** That's remarkable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After that, I started telling people about the topical use. About 30 people had essentially immediate recovery from various types of arthritis. Another woman with multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, who had been paralyzed and blind for weeks at a time, lectured to my endocrine class about how progesterone injections helped her.

**John Barkhausen:** Are there any cautionary tales about using progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a man takes a very big dose, it has a "cold shower effect"—it simply displaces testosterone temporarily. Also, it is an anesthetic. Once, a friend accidentally put a spoonful of it in a margarita, and I couldn't feel where my hands and feet were for about half an hour. I don't think it should be used in more than a 10% solution.

**John Barkhausen:** That reminds me of the Wall Street Journal article about brain-damaged people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was known in the 50s as a brain-preserving hormone. It's a growth factor for nerves and an anti-inflammatory, anti-edema agent. Edema is one of the factors that kills brain cells after injury. Progesterone stops the damage and promotes remyelinization of the fibers. In the 70s, I advocated that everyone should carry a bottle with them in case they were in an accident as first aid.
