## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhausen. This week we continue with another archive interview recorded on April 26, 2010, with Dr. Raymond Peat. He is a physiologist living in Eugene, Oregon, who has been studying health and the history of science for his entire life. Today’s interview concerns human digestion: how it works, how it affects us, and the psychological and physical repercussions of good and healthy digestion.

Dr. Raymond Peat has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at colleges including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana, the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, and Blake College. In addition to his science research bimonthly newsletter and other writings—some of which are available at raypeat.com—he conducts private nutritional counseling. Ray, welcome back.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hello.

**John Barkhausen:** I'm basing our discussion today on one of your recent newsletters from January 2010 entitled "Cascara, Energy, Cancer and the FDA's Laxative Abuse." I thought I'd use it as a takeoff point to talk about digestion in general. There isn't much coverage of that in the media, yet it's something we all have to do. Perhaps you could start off by defining what you consider to be digestion in a healthy organism.

## The Physiology of Digestion

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything should work smoothly. The food should be appetizing so that it stimulates the whole system. Pavlov was one of the pioneers in studying digestion scientifically. He showed that the knowledge of the food and the sensory quality of the food completely dominates the digestive process. Recent experiments show that the taste of food will even affect your blood sugar. If you eat something sweet, it will raise your blood sugar even if your throat is cut—it's a nervous connection that tells you that you are ready to start using food. Even if the food doesn't get into your blood, the taste of it will start raising your blood sugar.

Pavlov isn't widely studied anymore. There continue to be some digestive experiments, but now they are mostly done by the pharmaceutical industry. However, there is a long scientific history of digestive processes, mostly on animals and a few on people. Walter C. Alvarez was a famous gastroenterologist who had a newspaper column in the 1940s and 50s, and he helped get some scientific information into the general culture regarding digestion.

**John Barkhausen:** When was Alvarez doing his scientific work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He did much of his scientific work in the 20s and 30s, but became a popular columnist later. After his time, most good research was done on animals related to agriculture, but some of it provided basic knowledge of how the intestine and digestive organs work. For example, they would isolate a loop of intestine to measure the blood going in and out, put certain foods in that little piece of intestine, and watch what happened.

They found that the more complex the food in the intestine, the more vigorously the digestive process worked. That one kind of experiment shoots down a whole bunch of dogma regarding food mixing or eating things in certain combinations. The most complex mixture seems to be the one that digests the most efficiently.

Pre-digestion has been advocated for foods like proteins, but in one experiment, digestive enzymes were stirred with acid and some protein. Just stirring it at body temperature didn't do much digestion. But when they added a piece of the intestine that had been washed, sterilized, and fixed—so it was basically just a structural framework—suddenly the protein digestion went full speed. It isn't just the enzymes in the liquid that digest the proteins into amino acids; the protein has to be in a certain configuration, held in place by the "surface fuzz" of the intestine, before the enzymes can efficiently work on it. Since it is digested in contact with the cells, the amino acids are absorbed immediately as they are liberated from the protein.

After the age of one, a person's digestive system doesn't do very well with free amino acids compared to the whole protein. Basically, food in the close-to-living state—complex and structurally more or less just mixed by chewing—is all it needs in preparation.

Something a lot of people don't think about is that humans don't have the enzymes for digesting a lot of plant materials, such as cellulose, lignin, and other structural materials. If we simply chew vegetables, unless we chew each bite for half an hour, a lot of the material is still going to be trapped in the indigestible framework. Bacteria in the intestine can then get at it. You are supporting bacterial growth when you eat most vegetable material, depending on how fibrous it is.

## Stress and Digestive Dysfunction

**John Barkhausen:** They are always recommending we eat fiber, so that could be a problem. Before we get into solutions, maybe you can cover the basic problems, causes, and stages of digestive dysfunction. I know a lot of people who are stressed out and have trouble digesting when stress is high.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nervous tension will make things slow down. Adrenaline will make your intestine stop moving. It's an adaptive thing, so the fight-or-flight reaction isn't interrupted by intestinal activity. High adrenaline will not only shut down the movement of the intestine and the secretion of digestive fluids, but it even reduces the circulation to the intestine. If it is too intense or prolonged, shutting off the blood supply can actually cause some of the intestine to die. Short of that, prolonged stress makes the intestinal wall become a poor barrier, so that more toxins leak through.

**John Barkhausen:** I see.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some types of hormonal disturbances will increase the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system—the opposite of the adrenaline side—and that often goes with high histamine release. When histamine is released, serotonin is often excessive too. For example, in low-thyroid people, there is often an excess of all the transmitter substances. Sometimes it goes in the direction of serotonin, adrenaline, and histamine all exciting the muscles of the intestine, causing it to contract and even go into spasm. Sometimes the spasms will shut off function, but more often, overactivity of that side will produce diarrhea.

**John Barkhausen:** As our digestion gets out of balance, it tends towards constipation or diarrhea. Is one worse than the other?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In constipation, if it's associated with high adrenaline, it tends to cause prolonged absorption of bacterial endotoxin. In an acute case of diarrhea, things are washed through so fast that it often reduces the absorption of toxins. As a rough generality, occasional diarrhea is probably somewhat therapeutic. However, chronic constipation has been known for thousands of years to be associated with cancer and other diseases. Just recently, I've been seeing cases of people with chronic constipation having strokes, aneurysms, and abnormal clotting. Stroke hemorrhages are now known to be promoted by endotoxin and inflammatory responses to the endotoxin.

## Endotoxin and Inflammation

**John Barkhausen:** I know you've written about endotoxin quite a bit, but I've talked to other medical people who have never heard of it. How does that occur?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you feed the bacteria, you can grow a culture of bacteria that are especially harmful. If you are under stress, your intestine lets too much of that into your bloodstream. If you don't feed your liver and keep it well-energized with the right amount of thyroid hormone and a good vitamin, mineral, and protein supply, your liver won't be able to detoxify the endotoxin that reaches it.

A little bit of endotoxin leaking in all the time keeps us in an immunologically toned-up state—it can be like exercise. But if your liver is letting too much through, it gets you into a chronic state of inflammation. In people injured in serious accidents, often all their major organs—kidneys, lungs, liver—will suffer and lose function. Endotoxin is the main thing involved in that multiple organ failure.

In a chronic process, these same inflammatory reactions to endotoxin produce degenerative changes in the blood vessels and brain, and promote tumor formation. In the last five or ten years, this has become one of the biggest areas of medical research. There is a tremendous new understanding of endotoxin's role in degenerative diseases. Coinciding with this, the FDA has outlawed all of the traditional laxatives.

**John Barkhausen:** Before we move on to the FDA, so endotoxin is from bacteria that is always with us, but we usually keep it under control?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. With aging or stress, our liver is less able to detoxify it. Low thyroid function is one of the things that makes the liver very weak at detoxifying. Estrogen is always there too, especially in women. After puberty, the liver tends to slow down under the influence of estrogen, which lets estrogen increasingly interact harmfully with other systems. You get very similar effects from overexposure to endotoxin or to estrogen. They both activate blood vessel leakiness and inflammation leading to degenerative diseases.

**John Barkhausen:** What is inflammation in the digestive system, and how does it affect us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing that happens with endotoxin or estrogen is the production of too much nitric oxide. One way that makes capillaries leak is by making them take up too much water. The nitric oxide poisons the mitochondria so they can't produce energy very fast. As energy production goes down, the cell simply swells up and gets looser in structure as it fills with water. This increases leakiness and lets more toxin get through.

As this proceeds, the wall of the intestine and the blood vessels get thicker, cutting off the delivery of oxygen. As the oxygen supply goes down, the cells produce lactic acid, which triggers more inflammatory substances. The wall of the intestine takes up more and more water through all layers—muscle, connective tissue, blood vessels—until, in an extreme state, the intestine becomes so thick there is no space left for the movement of food. Many people have seen X-rays after a barium meal where there are big wads of opaque material and other areas with none at all, or just a little thread. That is often caused by the intestine swelling up with massive amounts of water. Instead of being a membrane-like, tough, muscular organ, it becomes a big, fat, heavy, sausage-like organization.

**John Barkhausen:** You're saying that swollen, watery state is basically a state of inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The simplest remedy for many people is just to take some aspirin and Benadryl to lower the inflammatory mediators. Aspirin works because people have consumed too much polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), which turns into prostaglandins—one of the endpoints causing inflammation. Waterlogging and histamine release are defended against by antihistamines. To reduce the risk in the long run, it's important to minimize your intake of those precursors of the inflammatory prostaglandins.

## Treating Digestive Stagnation

**John Barkhausen:** Part of the digestive process is peristalsis, where the intestine has a contraction that moves food along.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and if they are waterlogged, the muscles simply can't contract. It's like if your arm swelled up to be two feet in diameter; you wouldn't be able to bend it.

**John Barkhausen:** Are there situations where peristalsis stops and you can use something to get it contracting again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar and salt are very effective because they lower adrenaline. If stress has stopped your intestine just because of adrenaline excess, sugar, salt, and maybe a little quick thyroid supplement can get it going again.

Hypothyroidism's classical symptoms include chronic constipation. But now that so many people are being drugged, there are a lot of opiates being widely prescribed. Everyone knows morphine and opium can cause terrible constipation. The intestine is normally a very rich source of endorphins—the natural endogenous opiates. Stress increases endorphins, and they act just like exogenous opiates: they tend to stop intestinal action. Several people have proposed using anti-opiates (used for treating heroin overdoses) to cure chronic spontaneous constipation, because stress often increases endorphins to the point of causing morphine-like constipation.

**John Barkhausen:** So hypothyroidism is a cause of digestive problems. Is the medical world aware of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They used to be. Fifty years ago, all doctors knew that constipation, dry skin, and falling hair were the most common signs of hypothyroidism. But after the Second World War, medical education changed from perception to following the instructions of drug salesmen. Nowadays, it doesn't occur to most doctors to look at the common signs and see a simple endocrine solution.

## Laxatives, Emodin, and the FDA

**John Barkhausen:** I know some people who have been prescribed a product called Imodin [Emodin]. I was lent some once when I had diarrhea, and I don't believe I had another movement for about three weeks. What is that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know the specific product, but it sounds like the good substance in some of the natural laxatives: Emodin.

**John Barkhausen:** We should talk about Emodin and the FDA's position on that. Can you describe the history of its use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main traditional laxatives were herbs. Sometimes minerals like Flowers of Sulfur were used, but the most common were herbs. Tobacco was sometimes a component because it increases intestinal tone. Nux vomica is an old one that contained strychnine, but that went out of the laxative world almost 100 years ago. The component that remained was Emodin, which is in cascara, aloe, and rhubarb root. It has many protective effects other than helping cure constipation.

A medical mythology grew up in the 20th century that these natural laxatives were "stimulants." If the intestine isn't swollen, you *can* stimulate it with histamine or serotonin. But the idea that natural laxatives were stimulating the nerves and muscles to contract was a mistaken definition. Because of the fear of stimulants—and the idea that stimulation might cause addiction or euphoria—doctors began advocating drinking more water and taking bulk-forming, water-binding laxatives.

To support their recommendation, they claimed the stimulating laxatives would cause the colon to turn brown or black, which was supposed to be proof of harmfulness. It turns out that in constipation, the constant irritation causes the intestine to produce a brown or black pigment as a defensive reaction. This "melanosis" of the intestine isn't scientifically supported as being caused by the laxatives themselves.

**John Barkhausen:** So doctors were using Cascara Sagrada and Aloe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. An old laxative called "Nature's Remedy" contained just aloe and cascara for about a hundred years. About 20 years ago, the cancer drug industry started researching chemicals in the same family as the active ingredient of aloe and cascara—anthraquinones. One of these was effective at killing cancer, but it would kill the heart. It was a synthetic derivative.

When this cancer drug was found to kill the heart, research led them to reinvestigate the natural substances. It turns out that Emodin is a good cancer drug, and it doesn't kill your heart. But it's a natural substance. They are still working on how to make a synthetic, patentable version they can sell.

Because of the cancer industry's involvement, the FDA began putting out warnings that the natural substance might cause cancer because it vaguely resembles compounds that do. There was never research to support that, but the FDA used that cancer risk to outlaw the natural substances sold as laxatives.

Coincidentally, within weeks of using that argument, they granted approval to a drug called Zelnorm. This was a synthetic that intensified the serotonin effect to simply overstimulate the intestine. The FDA approved a synthetic that was nothing but a very powerful stimulant simultaneously with taking the natural laxatives off the market. The market was wide open for Zelnorm to be sold at three or four dollars per tablet. They were making something like a billion dollars a year until too many people started having their colons or other parts of their intestine die and have to be removed.

**John Barkhausen:** I see.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drug was authorized for a maximum of four months. After that, doctors were required not to prescribe it anymore, even though the company was making so much money. The FDA knew there was no permanent good laxative solution and that Zelnorm was outlawed in Europe because it killed intestines. But the FDA let them go for about five years, making their billions, and then outlawed it.

**John Barkhausen:** From the way you describe that, it sounds like the FDA is basically working hand in hand with the industry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It would be interesting to see how rich the people in the FDA got after that episode. Traditionally, people involved in approving bad drugs often wind up very rich.

## W.F. Koch and Cellular Energy

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The FDA's involvement in these chemicals goes back much further. This family of chemicals, the quinones, was found 100 years ago to be protective. W.F. Koch was experimenting with the anti-cancer effects of these materials as early as the 1910s. The FDA was determined to shut him down by the 1940s.

There were two trials, and he won both because so many of his patients testified they had been cured of cancer. He was producing variations on the quinones. The FDA's response was that quinones are toxic. In court, he demonstrated putting a certain amount of simple quinone into water and diluting it to the strength he injected into patients. The FDA claimed there was none in there because their instruments weren't good enough to detect it, but then argued that if there *was* any, it would be toxic.

About eight years after his second trial, Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) was discovered and found to work exactly as Koch had described: stimulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism with anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antispasmodic, anti-cancer, and anti-infective effects.

**John Barkhausen:** So his treatment was basically helping your cells go back to a healthy state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Albert Szent-Györgyi, who won a Nobel Prize partly for his work on cellular energy metabolism, kept following the Koch approach. He believed cell oxidative processes are the proper place to focus in treating diseases of muscle, nerve function, and cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** At this point, doctors aren't allowed to prescribe Emodin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They can prescribe it, but it can't be sold as a laxative. It can be sold as a substance or supplement.

**John Barkhausen:** Where does it come from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Rhubarb root and aloe leaf contain variations of the molecule. Cascara bark is from a very common plant across North America. In its fresh state, the bark causes stimulation and cramping, so traditionally it was aged for at least a year until it turns black, like bitter chocolate. In that state, the soapy quality has broken down and the glucose part has been removed, making it an oil-soluble molecule. In that state, it isn't an intestinal stimulant; it is an anti-inflammatory, slightly sedative, energy-increasing substance.

Just recently, malaria [drugs/mechanisms] were found to be toxic by activating a process that's essential to cancer. It could be that Emodin will turn out to be tried as a treatment for many other diseases other than cancer and constipation.

**John Barkhausen:** How does Emodin work? Does it basically get your cells to produce energy the way they are supposed to?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The actual consumption of oxygen and production of ATP is secondary to a general "tuning up." Natural substances like progesterone, caffeine, and thyroid hormones bind to proteins and cause the protein's electronic behavior to change. The respiratory chain in the mitochondria is tuned up by small molecules associated with it. Coenzyme Q10 helps it take in energy without producing destructive oxidative reactions. Vitamin K, which is a quinone analogous to Emodin, increases the effectiveness of Coenzyme Q10.

This overlap can only be explained as a tuning up of the whole cell system. Szent-Györgyi discussed substances that act on DNA and proteins as a system, increasing the "coherence" of the cell electronically. I don't think cancer or hormone actions will be understood unless the coherence of the cell's electronic system is taken into account.

**John Barkhausen:** You said in your newsletter that the approach of Koch and Szent-Györgyi—making your body healthier and able to deactivate toxins—is in contrast to the mainstream medical approach, which is a war mentality targeting cancer cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Metchnikoff saw the immune system as a developmental process of the whole organism, not just something aimed at killing germs. But the drug industry wanted to think of their product as a germ-killing analog to the immune system. They shut down the Metchnikoff approach and went to the "kill the enemy" approach. That mentality transferred to cancer: identifying the cancer as an alien mutant rather than a dysregulation of a natural process.

## Dietary Recommendations

**John Barkhausen:** If people are hoping to improve their digestion, what natural food substances might they use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Raw carrots, by having a germicidal effect on the bacteria, can be very helpful until you get your hormones working. A good thyroid and steroid hormone system will make your intestine have the energy to control the flora on its own. In the meantime, a daily raw carrot helps keep down endotoxin absorption. When they are available, cooked bamboo shoots are another good intestine protector.

**John Barkhausen:** So those are the fibers you would recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because grain fibers turned out to cause bowel cancer in several research settings. Keeping your general nutrition up with adequate protein is the other main thing to make your digestion work. Eating milk, cheese, and orange juice, along with one of those protective disinfecting fibers, will take care of most bowel problems.

**John Barkhausen:** We are out of time, Ray. Thank you so much for being on today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, very good.
