## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** We are talking to Maggie Gunderson today. This is Politics and Science on the 16th of March, 2011. Today we're discussing the nuclear catastrophe happening in Japan. Maggie Gunderson is founder and president of Fairewinds Associates and a freelance paralegal specializing in environmental nuclear safety and energy litigation in federal and state administrative law hearings. You worked in the nuclear industry for a while, right, Maggie? As did your husband, Arnie.

**Maggie Gunderson:** Yes, we both did. That's where we met.

**John Barkhausen:** I was hoping you could bring us up to date with what exactly is happening over in Japan and what the ramifications are for that part of the world and for us.

## Status of the Fukushima Reactors

**Maggie Gunderson:** The news that just came during the last hour is that all the fuel has boiled dry in Unit 4. That was in the spent fuel pool, not in the reactor itself. That was a full offload, so that is a tremendous amount of radioactive fuel that is getting very, very hot. There is a fear that it could catch on fire. If it catches fire, those particles become airborne. It's a worse scenario than having a melt.

**John Barkhausen:** It is?

**Maggie Gunderson:** Yes, it is, because that radiation will travel anywhere. If there's a meltdown, it does get into the water table, but you might be able to corral some of the contamination and do things to mitigate it. But this is airborne, and this will go wherever the air blows. It's like if you see someone smoking a cigarette; the plume can move in whatever direction the wind is blowing—towards Tokyo, towards the US, towards mainland China, and across the rest of Japan.

**John Barkhausen:** I know Chernobyl was terrible because it was an explosion that forced the radiation out. That was a core meltdown, wasn't it?

**Maggie Gunderson:** No, there was a graphite fire. The Chernobyl plant is a graphite plant and was not a liquid reactor like we're talking about here. There was a fire in the graphite only at Chernobyl. Only 3% of the radiation escaped; the other 97% is still inside the containment, inside the sarcophagus that they built around it.

In this accident, since the containment has failed, this radiation is getting out to the environment. The US Surgeon General was on a tour in California and spoke of the fact that anyone in the US should consider getting potassium iodide to protect their thyroid. That would be a prudent thing to do. The NRC and the State Department announced today that they told all US personnel in Japan to go at least 80 miles away from what's happening. That's more than double what the Japanese are saying.

**John Barkhausen:** The NRC is usually... I never thought of them as being actually that worried about low-level radiation.

**Maggie Gunderson:** Well, it's not low-level radiation. It's not an explosion like a bomb, but it's not low-level. There are no more personnel on site operating the plants. They've had to remove them because the radiation levels are too high.

**John Barkhausen:** So basically things are just running their course.

**Maggie Gunderson:** They're running their course. They do have people who are risking their lives to keep putting water on the plant, pumping seawater up there, but there are no operational things that they can do.

## The Danger of Spent Fuel Pools

**John Barkhausen:** Is Number 4 one of the reactors that was out of commission, so all the fuel rods were waiting to be moved?

**Maggie Gunderson:** Yes, all the fuel rods had been offloaded into the fuel pool. What's really scary about that is that there are no control rods to put in to slow down the reaction. The fuel rods are in the fuel pool and as the water burns off, there's nothing to keep that fuel pool cool. If the fuel gets really hot and starts a chain reaction, it cannot be stopped because there is nothing to moderate that chain reaction.

That was the difference with Chernobyl. Chernobyl is a plant where, as the chain reaction is going on inside, the operators have to work really hard to pull it back. It's like pushing a gas pedal downwards all the time. In the Japanese plants—which are the same as the Vermont Yankee plant, boiling water reactors of the same vintage and design—you have to push the reaction to happen. Usually, you have a lot of control. But they don't have control on this because this is the spent fuel all just sitting there together. There are no control rods. As the decay heat causes chain reactions, you could have a fire or a meltdown in the fuel pool itself.

**John Barkhausen:** What's the state of the other reactors? There are six of them there at the Fukushima power station.

**Maggie Gunderson:** Two of them already are in partial meltdown. When the earthquake started, the emergency systems worked and the reaction stopped. However, 5% of the heat is decay heat, and that is what has kept burning. The diesels got swamped by the tsunami, so they didn't have any backup power and couldn't cool the reactors.

My understanding—and this has been changing hour by hour—is that two reactors have had a partial meltdown. How bad that will be will depend on how much seawater these employees, who are risking their lives, can pump in. They are pumping in tons of seawater to try and make a lake under the reactors.

In a boiling water reactor (BWR), the control rods come up from the bottom into the reactor itself. In a pressurized water reactor (PWR), which I worked on, the control rods come down from the top. In the BWR, the bottom of the reactor is not as tight. The daughter products that are generating all this excess heat are slumping into the bottom and making a molten mass. That is coming out of the bottom of the reactor. That's why they're trying to make a lake between the base of the metal reactor vessel and the concrete base of the containment.

**John Barkhausen:** Is this special nuclear-grade concrete?

**Maggie Gunderson:** It's just regular concrete, like you would find on a bridge. There's not a special nuclear grade to it.

**John Barkhausen:** How long can that hold up to temperatures that I've heard are like 2200 degrees?

**Maggie Gunderson:** No one knows. We're in uncharted territory here. The fuel pool can get up to 4,000 degrees. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) is saying there can't be a fire in the fuel pool, but there's already been one. They say the containment can't leak, but two of them have blown their lids off.

We need to go back and look at the general design criteria on every nuclear plant. A lot of them are just too old. Vermont Yankee, Oyster Creek, Pilgrim—these are very old plants that don't have any current safety standards around them. All of the parameters under which they were built have been grandfathered in, so they don't meet the current regulations.

## Risks at US Plants like Vermont Yankee

**John Barkhausen:** Vermont Yankee got an upgrade 10 years ago, I think.

**Maggie Gunderson:** An uprate is really a frightening thing. If there's an accident at Vermont Yankee, there is 40% more radiation than a normal accident because of the uprate. Even though the uprate was 25%, the way the daughter products act, you get 40% more radiation. The emergency evacuation plan was designed around the way the plant was built before the uprate. It is not possible to get everyone out before there would be a lethal dose if there was a severe accident.

**John Barkhausen:** People would say Vermont Yankee is not at risk because it's not in an earthquake zone and there's no danger of tsunami. But it is next to a river. Is there a flooding danger there?

**Maggie Gunderson:** Yes, there is a flooding danger. Hurricanes could knock out power or destabilize the grid. Vermont Yankee's backup power is diesel, just like the plants in Japan. If they were involved in a flood or a hurricane and couldn't operate, there is no backup power. If a huge storm knocked out the service water that cools the plant out of the Connecticut River, or if terrorists attacked the intake structures, you couldn't cool that plant. The NRC does not consider that a realistic part of its threat matrix.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you know how the fallout from what's happening in Japan might behave?

**Maggie Gunderson:** No one knows. Will a lot of that come across the Pacific to the US? There was extensive data from bomb testing done in the Pacific originally, and a lot of that strontium and cesium were carried to the US and absorbed into kids' muscles and bones. This accident is worse than Three Mile Island, worse than Chernobyl. It is the worst industrial accident the world has ever seen. With plutonium involved, there's going to be 250,000-year waste left.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like you were once in favor of nuclear power, but you have changed your position.

**Maggie Gunderson:** That's correct. I was in favor of nuclear power. I was part of Jobs for Energy Independence. I was working in the nuclear industry, in part to make sure that when there's plenty of energy available, women and minorities have jobs. The scientists had assured me it was the safest thing. I don't believe it anymore.

**John Barkhausen:** Thank you very much, Maggie Gunderson.

**Maggie Gunderson:** You're very welcome, John. Take care.

## Dr. Raymond Peat: Radiation Effects and Mitigation

**John Barkhausen:** I'm back live with Dr. Raymond Peat, who is a physiologist, biologist, and science historian from Eugene, Oregon. Thanks for coming on today. Considering the catastrophe in Japan, I thought we could talk about radiation's effects on the body and ways it can be mitigated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first issue of my newsletter in 1981 was about the issue of radiation damage. I read lots of mostly Soviet research; they were the ones mostly interested in how to repair damage. The main factors are the amount of magnesium in the cells and the metabolic rate. It happens that thyroid hormone is what's needed for the cells to retain magnesium at a high level.

The central idea I reviewed 30 years ago was a high metabolic rate activating repair processes so that once the damage was done, it was almost immediately repaired. Just in the last couple of years, a group studying radio-resistant bacteria found that manganese is an essential factor for the survival of these bacteria. What the manganese is doing is catalyzing a very fast metabolism of glucose. This very fast glucose metabolism is almost all turned into carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide happens to protectively stick to amino groups of proteins.

My approach to defense against aging and stress has been to keep the carbon dioxide up high in mammals. Apparently, these bacteria carry it to an extreme so that they can survive millions of rads of ionizing radiation.

**John Barkhausen:** Does this have to do with the thyroid function as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It parallels the thyroid function. The bacteria do it just by this manganese-containing enzyme system, but in mammals, it's the thyroid hormone that's primarily responsible for turning glucose and fats into carbon dioxide.

## Thyroid Protection and Potassium Iodide

**John Barkhausen:** One of the problems with radiation is that it damages the thyroid. The American Surgeon General just recommended that people get a supply of potassium iodide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CDC recommended a single dose of 160 milligrams of potassium iodide for an adult, to be repeated if the iodine cloud stays around for more than one day. Kelp, dulse, or other iodine-rich seaweed—a few grams per day—will do that if you don't have the pure potassium iodide. Even antiseptic tincture of iodine painted on the skin is an alternative way of getting your iodine up.

But I think the basic thing is to keep your thyroid hormone active, if necessary by using a supplement of thyroid hormone to keep your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) down as close to zero as you can get it. That's good for many reasons. If your TSH is kept at zero, your thyroid won't be metabolizing and won't take up the toxic concentration of radioactive iodine. Meanwhile, high thyroid activity is going to accelerate the repair processes.

If you rely on potassium iodide, that's going to dilute the radioactive contaminant so it doesn't destroy your thyroid gland, but the potassium iodide tends to suppress your thyroid gland function, lowering the whole body's metabolic rate. That makes it increasingly susceptible to radiation damage.

If you think of the inverse relationship between thyroid and estrogen: a low thyroid person usually has very high estrogen, and a high thyroid person has low estrogen. Estrogen synergizes with radiation damage. So, a low thyroid person is doing many things to make all of their tissues more susceptible to injury by all of the radiation sources—which include carbon isotopes, cesium, and strontium. The iodide suppressing your thyroid gland isn't going to do anything to protect you against strontium, cesium, or carbon, and in fact, will tend to make you more susceptible to injury by them.

**John Barkhausen:** Because if your thyroid is functioning, you'll be able to remove those quicker?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The cells are producing carbon dioxide, which forms a defensive barrier on the proteins, keeping them from suffering destructive oxidation. And the magnesium retained by the thyroid is used in the repair enzymes for DNA repair. At the same time, you're lowering the estrogen throughout your body, which avoids that synergistic effect of radiation and estrogen.

**John Barkhausen:** In terms of raising your thyroid function, most people probably won't be able to get their hands on any thyroid supplements. How can they do that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The quickest way is to make sure that you're getting enough food and fuel. Sugar, moment by moment, is used by your liver to activate the thyroid hormone. If you go hungry for several hours, your thyroid is going to decrease its function.

On an even shorter scale, coconut oil, with its short-chain saturated fatty acids, competes with the inhibiting unsaturated fats that are always tending to circulate in the body acting as a break on the thyroid. The coconut oil short-chain fats compete against the inhibitors, momentarily liberating a higher thyroid function. That only lasts a couple of hours for a tablespoon of coconut oil. So, if you add nothing else, you could eat a tablespoon of coconut oil every couple of hours.

**John Barkhausen:** What about Vitamin E and Vitamin C?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not very. In some situations, they're protective against radiation, but when I reviewed the literature, they were somewhat ambiguous. Progesterone as an anti-estrogen is probably one of the other short-range protective things.

## Estrogen and Radiation Similarity

**John Barkhausen:** You've said before that radiation is very similar in its effects to estrogen. Could you comment on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of this research was done in the late 1930s. The estrogen functions were identified as similar to suffocation, stress, and radiation. About 15 years later, when the concept of the estrogen receptor was introduced, there was a great push to distract people from the biochemical effects of estrogen and blame all of estrogen's effects on the actions of a receptor protein.

It turned out that research was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission. It claimed that estrogen is not metabolized in cells where it's acting. 20 years later, that was proven to be absolutely false. The fact that it was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission and done by a man who had been working in chemical warfare makes the whole foundation of the receptor theory suspect.

The 1930s research was very clear that any stress activates the estrogen functions, which include inflammation, water uptake, suppression of the respiratory function, and eventually atrophy, fibrosis, calcification, and cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** And radiation has those similar effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Biochemically, they seem similar. My dissertation was trying to find anything different between radiation stress and estrogen's effect, and I couldn't find any basic physiological or biochemical difference. They both interfere with oxidative metabolism and activate the stress metabolism.

**John Barkhausen:** How does the military fit into this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are the ones that promoted the concept of the estrogen receptor. Elwood Jensen went from working on chemical warfare to working on the estrogen receptor. His group formed a tradition supported by the Pentagon. Some of them have been working more recently at Lawrence Livermore Radiation Lab on the estrogen receptor. So for 60 years now, it has been of great importance to the military, the Atomic Energy Commission, and various government agencies. At different times they have been interested in its birth control effect and population control. Estrogen is really a more controllable way to sterilize the population.

## Fallout and Radiation Types

**John Barkhausen:** What is the danger we face from what's coming out of Japan now? Is this particulate radiation that we're going to be exposed to?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As long as it stays very high in the atmosphere and doesn't rain out, it isn't going to do too much harm. But if it rains out, wherever it comes down, it will do a lot of damage. A few of the bombs exploded in Nevada happened to stay in the air until one of the fallout clouds rained down in New York. Ernest Sternglass happened to be on the site and saw that his radiation measurements were showing extreme contamination while the government was saying nothing had happened. That started Sternglass on his research. He showed how the U.S. Public Health Service was collaborating with the Atomic Energy Commission to put out false information. So whatever we're going to hear from the governments of Japan and the United States, I don't think there's any precedent for thinking there will be any truth in it.

**John Barkhausen:** One of the reassurances we're always told is that nuclear power emissions don't go above the background radiation. But background radiation is always going up because of their own emissions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The type of radiation is crucial in its biological effects. The industry uses tricks, comparing living in Denver or flying in an airplane with breathing fallout. They ignore the fact that the gamma rays they're counting in Denver have a low energy transfer to the tissues; they go through so fast they don't react. At sea level, you're getting tertiary and secondary cosmic rays which have more energy delivery in a toxic way to your tissues. So actually, Denver has less biologically effective radiation than sea level.

Another trick they use is to show an alpha emitter and a detector, then put a sheet of typing paper in the path to show that it stops the alpha particles. But if you inhale an alpha emitter, when that particle goes, it's going to hit a cell, not a sheet of typing paper. The fact that it will stop in a sheet of paper means that it has 100% delivery of its energy to the tissue. It's the delivery of energy that causes the tissue damage.

**John Barkhausen:** So if you inhale a particulate that's radioactive, even though it might not be that much radiation, it's the fact that you're getting all of it in one place that makes it serious.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The beta radiation from iodine, strontium, and cesium is basically all going to be absorbed when a particle decomposes in your tissues. It's not as locally intense as alpha particles, but it's much more effective at tissue delivery than X-rays or gamma rays just passing through your body.

**John Barkhausen:** Could you summarize what alpha, beta, and gamma mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alpha particles are actually an atomic nucleus, so it's a big fat particle that stops easily when it runs into cell material. A beta particle is an electron, which is much more able to pass through cells without being absorbed, but it still is a particle of matter or electricity. X-rays and gamma rays are photons, analogous to light. Certain frequencies will resonate more with the living substance, but they have a very low linear transfer of energy compared to particles.

**John Barkhausen:** How does fallout compare to going in for medical or dental X-rays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thyroid is damaged by all of them. But if you breathe in or eat the particles, the fallout is considerably worse than just having a dental X-ray. Dental X-rays tend to cause cancer of the eyeball, the brain, and the thyroid. But the government's tendency has been to use whatever measure sounds the least threatening, such as failing to make the distinction between the local dose and the total body dose. They did the same thing with the atomic bombs in Japan; they averaged out the people at a certain distance in any direction, making the people who were actually exposed to the fallout disappear by averaging them 360 degrees around the circle.

**John Barkhausen:** We're out of time. Could you quickly summarize the things people could do to mitigate radiation problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eating seaweed, kelp. If you have a bottle of iodine, you can paint some on your fingers and toes and soak up some of it through your skin. This shouldn't be done until the cloud is actually here, because excess iodine is toxic to your thyroid in itself. But if there's an intense cloud passing over, these external sources of iodine will protect the thyroid. However, keeping your thyroid function up is the ideal way to do it. That is done with sugar, coconut oil, and when possible, a thyroid supplement.

**John Barkhausen:** Dr. Raymond Peat, thanks so much for being on tonight. You can find out more about his work at his website, raypeat.com.
