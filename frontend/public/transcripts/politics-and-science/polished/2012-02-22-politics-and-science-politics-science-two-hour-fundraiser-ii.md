## The "Dead Universe" Theory in Biology

**John Barkhausen:** We have a caller. Justin, go ahead.

**Justin:** Fascinating stuff. I’d love to hear Ray talk about the "dead universe" theory and biological fields. I was talking about the notion that the universe was dead and inert, and that most of biology was just kind of of that nature. Do you understand what I'm saying, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The field idea in biology—embryology as a model of development according to interactions with the environment—that idea continued. Some of the people who were developing experiments to understand the rules by which an organism takes form were vitalists. They believed there was something extra besides the matter. But at least they were interested in the actual events as the organism took form.

They were knocked out of biology by the gene people, who I would say are on the side of an inert cosmos. They want to explain things in terms of essentially immaterial information. They are the ones who talk about the vitalists wanting to introduce a "vital principle" as being somehow against the materialism of science. But the genetics people really want to depreciate the material world in favor of an information world.

The idea of the Central Dogma was that the information we have in our genes is immortal, can't be added to, and can only be written out into mortal, temporary, imperfect organisms. But the genes are the timeless stuff. Calling people like Hans Driesch a vitalist and saying that they weren't really biologists is kind of self-referential, because the genetics people have thrown out most of the interesting stuff in biology until the last ten years or so.

**John Barkhausen:** When they're starting to get back to the field theory again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Thyroid Supplementation: T4 vs. T3

**John Barkhausen:** I have a question from Brittany. She asks: "If you are trying to self-treat for hypothyroid based upon blood tests and symptoms, how much T4 would be considered too much to take? And is T4 even necessary at all?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The problem with the commercialization of synthetic T4 that started in the late 1940s was that they tested it on male medical students who were about 25 years old and selected for good health. They found that it worked in them just like the real thyroid substance that had been in use for about 50 years at that time.

The trouble is that it then became commercialized. Women have at least five times the incidence of thyroid problems because of the antagonism between estrogen and thyroid. The thyroid sluggishness that's so common in women shows up as a slow metabolism of the liver. Typically, a woman premenstrually will get drunk on a fraction of the alcohol that it takes to make a man drunk because the liver is slowed down by the antagonism between estrogen and thyroid and oxidative metabolism.

It happens that thyroxine (T4) has to be activated in the liver by taking off one of the iodines in the right position to make it the active hormone called T3. If women are having low blood sugar symptoms or high estrogen symptoms—things that are the result of hypothyroidism—then T4 can very often not help or even make the problem worse.

Some experimenters tried to argue that thyroid does something other than rev up the oxidative metabolism. They took slices of muscle, kidney, liver, brain, and heart, and added thyroxine (T4) to these cultured slices. They saw that the liver had a tremendous burst of oxidative activity, but the kidneys didn't do much, the muscles didn't do anything, and added to the brain, it actually suppressed oxidative metabolism.

They said, "You see, oxidation isn't what thyroid really does. It just happens that the liver responds that way." But they were looking at the pre-hormone. The liver has to turn it into the active hormone before it can work in the muscles, kidneys, heart, and brain.

It turns out that the brain concentrates the blood; it can have 40 times as much T4 as T3. If your liver is a little sluggish, your brain will still concentrate the T3 to the point that it has a one-to-one ratio. If you put the brain slice in the dish where it can't get a new supply of T3 constantly, the added T4 can't do anything except displace some of the active hormone that the brain had been concentrating. So adding T4 to the brain in the culture dish caused suppression of metabolic activity. In people, you very often see it causing neurological symptoms—strange electrical sensations, ringing ears, worse memory—various things that are really signs of worse thyroid function.

**John Barkhausen:** So it sounds like you shouldn't be taking very much T4, if any at all, especially if you're a woman.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's very good if you don't need it very much.

**John Barkhausen:** A lot of people take a mixture of T4 and T3, supposedly close to the physiological dose of 1 to 5.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you take a human gland or a cow gland, it's close to a 4 to 1 ratio.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that a good mixture to take if you were supplementing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, even a 5 to 1 mixture is okay. But the people who were insisting on still using the Armour Thyroid with its 4 to 1 ratio in the 1960s ran into issues. As the pharmaceutical companies developed tests for diagnosing thyroid, they noticed that the people taking thyroxine (T4) had maybe a 40 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3 in the blood. The people taking Armour had maybe a 10 to 1 or a 5 to 1 ratio. They defined the people taking T4 as the "normal" and the ones taking Armour as having too much T3. But most doctors at that time weren't aware at all that T3 was the active thyroid hormone.

**John Barkhausen:** So they jumped to conclusions and we're still stuck with some of those conclusions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of the ideas that spread quickly in the late 1940s, when the first blood tests for thyroid came on the market around the same time as Synthroid (the T4 product), was the Protein Bound Iodine (PBI) test. People like Broda Barnes had seen close to half of the population benefiting from some thyroid—which used to be part of the meat supply until the agriculture department said the meat companies could no longer sell it. In Broda Barnes' time, he saw that somewhere between 20% and 45% of the people benefited from taking some thyroid.

But these new blood tests in the late 40s found that 95% of the people had a fairly high level of iodine-bound protein in the blood. That created the idea that only 5% need a thyroid supplement. By the 1960s, new tests came about and they realized that the PBI test had almost nothing to do with thyroid function. So the standard that still persists widely—that only 5% of the population is potentially a candidate for supplement—the basis for establishing that had nothing to do with the thyroid function.

## Digestion and Reverse Peristalsis

**John Barkhausen:** Lilia asks: "If you tend to constantly have excessive air, chest pressure, or feeling the need to burp, is that a sign of low stomach acid with undigested food causing problems, or too much stomach acid? And what would you do about it?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically no. A lot of different things can cause that. Some people can actually have reverse peristalsis. When you analyze burps, most of the time it's air that you've swallowed coming back. But sometimes you find other gases such as methane coming out.

Walter Alvarez demonstrated that it's pretty common for people to experience very intense reverse peristalsis. He put some lycopodium powder in his medical students' rectums when they went home for the evening. He had them fill out a questionnaire saying whether they typically experienced morning breath. When they came in the morning after getting the lycopodium powder, he took a swab in their mouth and found lycopodium powder in the mouths of the ones who typically had bad breath.

**John Barkhausen:** Wow, that's a little grim. So you think most of the time the burping is just from swallowing air?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the daytime. Most of the reverse peristalsis happens in the night. If you're low thyroid, your autonomic nervous system tends to rev up, compensating for the lower oxidative metabolism. It pushes it harder to increase your adrenaline in particular. The adrenaline tends to stop the forward propulsion of the peristalsis. Then random signals—irritation from something in your intestine—can probably send waves going both directions. That is probably more common when your digestive system is slightly paralyzed by a very high adrenaline level.

## Multiple Sclerosis and Thyroid

**John Barkhausen:** Sheila asks: "What are your thoughts on multiple sclerosis? What causes it and how do you think it should best be treated?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 70s, I saw a series of five people over a period of maybe a year or two. As they told me their symptoms, I said that sounds like classical hypothyroidism. A couple of these people went to their old-fashioned doctors with a list of the symptoms they just told me and said, "Here are my symptoms, what do I have?" The doctor said hypothyroidism and gave them thyroid. In that series of five people in a row, every one of them discovered they didn't have multiple sclerosis, but rather just needed a thyroid supplement.

## Thyroid Overdose and Recovery

**John Barkhausen:** The same person asks: "Why do I feel bad after I accidentally took too much desiccated thyroid?" She increased it a little too fast and managed to get some raw thyroid from a butcher. She would like to know how long it usually takes for the thyroid to get back to normal when you stop eating it, and is there anything to do to feel better quicker?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People probably worry too much about it. T4 has a half-life of two weeks, and T3 in different people can have a half-life as short as one day. If you got a sudden overdose and your pulse went up to maybe 150 beats per minute at rest, in 48 hours you would probably have lost at least half of your T3, which is the active stuff. Your liver would then be putting out just a disposal amount, converting the T4 to T3. Usually, if you took so much that you had a very fast heart rate, in two days you would probably be down to a fairly safe, comfortable 120 beats per minute.

**John Barkhausen:** If you wanted to intervene and make that transition quicker?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen some people who spontaneously became hyperthyroid or who had overdosed juicing raw cabbage. It just takes a glass or two of that to very powerfully suppress your thyroid functions. Usually a glass or two a day for a couple of days and the person is back down to normal. Liver is another suppressive food. If you eat two big meals of liver, you can see a big decrease in thyroid function.

**John Barkhausen:** How long does that suppression last from liver or cabbage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of days. The fear of suppressing your thyroid gland itself by taking too much thyroid has been tested using isotopes. They would dose people until they could tell there was no thyroid being produced by their own gland, and then they stopped dosing them to see if there was any concern about prolonged suppression. Everyone's gland came right back in a couple of days.

**John Barkhausen:** That's encouraging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People farmers used who had their own animals would often eat the thyroid gland in the chicken neck. One guy I knew said that on Friday they always had fried chicken in the field for lunch. He said Friday afternoons he was always too hot to work, but he would eat five necks and get probably 20 grains of thyroid—a very suppressive dose. He would be very hot, but by the next day it would have passed.

## Reverse T3

**John Barkhausen:** Wade asks: "I would like to ask Ray's thoughts on Reverse T3. Is it really necessary to use T3 treatment only to clear out the accumulated Reverse T3, or will a combination thyroid product and proper nutrition resolve the issue?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's mostly caused by high cortisol and stress hormones. Eating a good supportive diet—plenty of fruit, orange juice, and milk—will help keep the stress down. I think it works just as effectively as taking small amounts of T3.

**John Barkhausen:** What causes Reverse T3? It is basically where your whole thyroid system shuts down, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If your body thinks that you're having an overexposure to thyroid, it gets rid of the excess by turning thyroxine into an inactive kind of T3. It takes off the wrong iodine. If you're fasting, for example, part of the thyroid is being excreted the way estrogen or toxins are being excreted, but part of it is being inactivated in a way that has an anti-thyroid effect. It interferes with the active T3. It's an extra fast way to turn off your thyroid function.

## MS Drugs: Naloxone and Naltrexone

**John Barkhausen:** I missed part of the question regarding drugs to decrease MS symptoms. I think it's called naloxone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, naloxone or naltrexone. When you're under stress, you produce endorphins. The endorphins compensate for injury or stress and they should go away. But prolonged stress can leave you inhibited in various ways with the wrong pattern of endorphins. If a person has been exposed to prolonged stress, sometimes you can break out of the pattern and recover functions with an anti-morphine treatment. Naloxone and naltrexone are the injected and oral forms of an anti-opiate that simply keeps the endorphin from having its effect. Sometimes that can restore functions that had been suppressed.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like you don't like opiates—you think they're actually bad for you in the long run. So that sounds like it's not a bad thing to be taking.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think it usually has its effect in just a few days, though. If it hasn't really made a big difference in just a few days, then it's probably some other problem.

**John Barkhausen:** If you wanted to keep the inflammation low, could you just use some other anti-inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. All kinds of stabilizing anti-inflammatory things. Thyroid, progesterone, short-chain fatty acids, and sugars are all things that help restore injured, demyelinated nerves.

## Prolotherapy

**John Barkhausen:** Lilia asks: "Do you have any thoughts on the efficacy of prolotherapy, in which a solution containing sugar in the form of dextrose is injected into tendons or ligaments to strengthen weakened connective tissue?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My father had it done. I think they used vegetable oil in the 1950s—a combination of novocaine and vegetable oil. It causes an inflammatory reaction and toughening up of the ligaments. It can cure some back problems without anything very invasive. So it's proven to work, but I think there are better things. It's usually a low DHEA production from low thyroid, high estrogen, and stress hormones that cause the ligaments and tendons to get weak. Correcting the thyroid function and maybe taking a DHEA or pregnenolone supplement would be the natural way to strengthen the ligaments and tendons, and it helps the bones at the same time.

## Thyroid as the Master System

**John Barkhausen:** I've heard the complaint about your writings before that "all he ever thinks is wrong with us is our thyroid," and somehow that's a put-down. How do you respond to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It doesn't apply just to people; it applies to all complex organisms practically. The difference between us and a fungus is that we've had a lot of thyroid and oxidative metabolism that the fungus hasn't benefited from. All of our functions are characterized by high-energy oxidative metabolism—the brain more than any other part.

As you look at the animal kingdom, the outstanding thing is that their oxidative metabolism increases as they go up the so-called evolutionary scale. Oxygen is driving our existence, and our existence is culminating in a bigger, more expensive brain that other animals couldn't afford because their thyroid function wasn't adequate. It's really the essential thing. Given oxygen and sugar and a few other materials, thyroid is the catalyst for making things run right.

**John Barkhausen:** The thyroid does seem like the master system in terms of energy production for everything.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If your thyroid is working efficiently, then your pituitary doesn't have much to do and you aren't likely to get a pituitary tumor. Your adrenals don't have much to do. Your ovaries don't get overstimulated. The other glands have an easy job when your thyroid is working right. If your thyroid gets interfered with, then you've got to rev up your adrenals, and then your pituitary becomes a commander-in-chief and tells everyone what to do with the stress hormones. Then you're at risk of getting tumors of the ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands, or thyroid gland because your pituitary is working them too hard.

## Arthritis and Progesterone

**John Barkhausen:** In our shows about progesterone, you were talking about instances where progesterone was very helpful to women with arthritis. Is it the right substance to use for men with arthritis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of the first people I gave it to was a friend over 40 years ago. Every afternoon his knee swelled up—obviously rheumatoid arthritis. It looked like a football. I got some standard injectable progesterone and he rubbed the whole vial from his side down to his calf. Two or three hours later he was walking and showed me his knee was no longer swollen. Just about three or four years ago, he was still walking without a limp. I hadn't noticed arthritis in all that time.

**John Barkhausen:** So for people developing arthritis in their hands now, is that also a thyroid problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your thyroid is down, you compensate with all kinds of other stress hormones. Your autonomic system goes up, but so does your adrenal cortical and aldosterone hormones. Estrogen increases, even melatonin gets involved. Some of these compensatory things don't quite compensate fully, and then they get involved in increasing the inflammation. That's where DHEA and progesterone—either taken orally or applied topically—are the things that are deficient as a consequence.

The other more delicate and dangerous hormones, such as estrogen and cortisol, increase because you're low in progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone. Supplementing any of those three, or all three of them, will usually alleviate or cure arthritis. I've known people with dogs or horses who thought the animal was so old it would never work again. Just giving it progesterone made the horse healthy and happy for several more years.

## Art, Politics, and Siqueiros

**John Barkhausen:** We have a caller.

**Caller:** Ray, in your essay on autonomic systems, you talk about 20th-century writing and painting being considered expressive rather than communicative. I was wondering if you could give some examples of 20th-century writers or painters you consider communicative and not insane? Maybe someone following in Blake's footsteps?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** David Alfaro Siqueiros was one of my heroes.

**John Barkhausen:** Why did you say that 20th-century artists are considered to be out of their minds?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were driven out of their minds partly by the CIA's project called the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which worked with Nelson Rockefeller to glorify what Siqueiros called the "ghost artists." They were creating a culture of anti-culture. The CIA knew exactly what they were doing, and presumably Nelson Rockefeller did too, when he and his fellow philanthropists concentrated on these people because of their antisocial consciousness. They ridiculed the idea that art should have a social consciousness. The CIA pumped Marshall Plan money into creating this alternative culture of abstract expressionism.

**John Barkhausen:** What do you think the government's motive was for doing that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** To improve the power of the Rockefeller class by keeping anyone who said art should be socially conscious shown to be some kind of degenerate or subversive. Siqueiros was working around the New York crowd and saw what was happening. It was years later, I think 1968, when this CIA financing of culture was revealed. But Siqueiros had been there seeing it going on.

## Moles and Melanoma

**John Barkhausen:** We just got another email question: "What causes moles on the skin?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I found that they were very hormonally related. In the summer of 1981, I had been watching a mole grow on my belly. It was obviously, to me, becoming a dangerous melanoma. It had grown from a little brown spot. A couple of doctors who happened to be visiting saw it and told me they thought it was a melanoma.

Around that time I was experimenting with different steroids. I happened to be tasting some DHEA. Without thinking of any connection, one night I noticed a shiny red dome on my belly where the mole had been. Over the next three or four days, the mole disappeared. Thinking about it, I realized I had been sampling the DHEA around that time.

The next time I started getting a mole that looked like it was turning into a melanoma—turning blue and white, with the spots swimming around or changing positions rapidly—I would apply a little progesterone or DHEA to that area. Immediately the color, instead of swimming around in colored spots, would level out and become just a little tan colored thing, and then it would go away.

I had a series of experiments. One was a mole as big as a jumbo olive. When I put some progesterone near it, within two weeks it had turned to a crisp and fallen off without leaving a trace of a scar. I found that I could sort of steer them. The pigment cells are extremely mobile. A huge black thing appeared suddenly on my lower arm. I put a dot of progesterone in vitamin E oil about an inch from the spot. The following day, there was a shadow of it about an inch downstream towards my hand. I put another dot on, and each time I put a dot on, the next day there would be a shadow an inch farther down. Pretty soon all of the cells had walked away from the big black spot.

In another case, putting a dot on the front of one on my forehead, the pigment cells moved out in a circumference away from it. On the third day, it looked like a bullseye. After about a week, the original spot had shrunk up and pinched off at the base.

**John Barkhausen:** Phenomenal.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Various other people who didn't experiment in such detail would just take an overdose of thyroid for a week or two, and day by day you could see their mole shrinking until, in one case, a mole an inch long disappeared from a guy's back in two weeks.

**John Barkhausen:** So you were just toying with it with that progesterone and pregnenolone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Very entertaining to see how fast these cells can run through your body. People have studied them on cover slips. At 90 degrees, which is the average skin temperature, a cell of that type can walk about an inch per day if it's motivated. I think the reason they collect in certain spots is that they come looking for something that's missing from where they were. Like they found some cell that was emitting DHEA, possibly, so everyone moves in to take advantage.

**John Barkhausen:** And that's maybe what caused the mole to form in the first place.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Some people in the last couple of months have been thinking about the factors that guide cell migration. It's probably going to be a very interesting field in the next few years—trying, for example, to lure cancer cells back from their metastatic positions, call them back to where they should be.

## Type 2 Diabetes and PUFA

**John Barkhausen:** We have a caller.

**Caller:** I wanted to talk about type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome and how it causes low testosterone. What's the best way to attack that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Get the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) out of your body as far as possible, or keep them in storage if they're there. Definitely avoid all kinds of polyunsaturated fats because those are the things that specifically interfere with the ability to oxidize glucose. One of the reasons that aspirin has been known for 100 years to help lower blood sugar in that kind of diabetes is that aspirin does several things to interrupt the effects of the polyunsaturated fats. It keeps them from turning into the inflammation-causing prostaglandins, but it also helps to keep them in storage where they don't do so much harm.

**Caller:** Does that also correlate to the weight loss curve? I found that as soon as weight is lost, the blood sugar starts regulating itself.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The fat cells are sending out signals that create inflammation. Leptin is one of the pro-inflammatory signals. You want to signal your fat to stop sending leptin if possible.

## Raw Vegetables

**John Barkhausen:** Jerry asks: "I eat raw vegetables out of the garden all summer. Is that a no-no? I always thought raw veggies were more nutritious than cooked."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on what they are. Peppers and tomatoes are really fruits; they are good raw. Carrots and some of the radishes, if you ate a lot of them, would be anti-thyroid. But there are some things called vegetables that are really fairly rich in sugar as well as the minerals. Those sweetish root vegetables are pretty healthy.

**John Barkhausen:** You're not very big on some raw vegetables, like beans?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the raw stuff is likely to feed bacteria and cause problems. If there is a seed developing in it, that has other specific toxins. Peas and beans are not so great.

## Eczema

**John Barkhausen:** I wanted to ask you about eczema. Do you have any tips for how to handle that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping your intestine in good condition is one of the things. Both eczema and psoriasis tend to flare up in a lot of people when they eat bread or other grains. Beans are very hard on the intestine in general. Seeds, grains, and beans irritating the intestine tend to create sympathetic reactions. The particular enzyme that reacts to gluten is involved in the maturing of the skin cells. This particular enzyme, transglutaminase, is now being studied as a link between the intestine and the skin.

**John Barkhausen:** What can somebody do about eczema if they have it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid very often helps. Sometimes pregnenolone, by balancing all of the others. It's the precursor to all of the steroid hormones and in itself it stops the stress reaction. To the extent that your stress system—from pituitary to adrenals—associates with a flare-up of skin problems, just by turning off the stress with pregnenolone, you can see a big change.

**John Barkhausen:** We are out of time. Dr. Raymond Peat, it's been a real pleasure. Thanks for handling all those questions so well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
