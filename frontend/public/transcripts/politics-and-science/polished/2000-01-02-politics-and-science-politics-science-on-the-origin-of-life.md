## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Hello and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhausen. Today we are dipping back into the archives to a show from the 1999–2000 time period. This is a philosophical discussion with Dr. Raymond Peat talking about the origins of life. The work of Lamarck, Darwin, and Vernadsky appear in this show.

For those who don't know, Dr. Raymond Peat has a PhD in biology and has specialized in physiology and endocrinology. He has extensive knowledge about the history of science and philosophy. You can find out more about Dr. Peat and read his articles at raypeat.com.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's necessary at some point to think about the philosophical things that have fed into controversies about the origin of life, as well as national cultural differences. I've studied the Russian tradition quite a bit, starting with Mendeleev, the man who invented the periodic table. He referred to himself as a cosmic realist.

About a generation younger than Mendeleev was V.I. Vernadsky. He called himself a biogeochemist and also thought of himself as a cosmic realist. What they meant by this was that you have to always think of the context of the problem you are dealing with and try to think of as many levels of the problem at the same time as you can.

## Cosmic Realism and the History of Science

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mendeleev completed his table around 1869. During the late 1800s, Vernadsky was traveling around Europe talking to people. He got to know all the interesting people in Europe, and every time he met someone, he would incorporate their ideas. Even literature fed into Vernadsky's way of looking at the world; he thought of Tolstoy's brain as a geochemical event.

Sechenov and Pavlov were others. They set out to try to explain human consciousness in realistic and physical terms so that they didn't have to leave anything out of the system. They didn't think of the material world without consciousness or a conscious world without material. It was a tradition of looking at the hidden assumptions behind everything.

From that perspective, there are attitudes in American and German science that I think have limited the way people think about the origin of life. Pasteur, for example, is selected by American educators as a way to obscure thinking about the origin of life. Because of his famous experiment demonstrating that life didn't arise from decaying organic matter—his principle was that life comes from life—people who didn't want to accept that life came from non-living matter seized upon this. They wanted to dispose of the idea of the origin of life and say that life came *only* from life. There is a deliberate obscuring principle going on when people try to place Pasteur's thinking at the top.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like they don't want to discuss it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The same thing happened to Pavlov. A man named Watson—who I doubt even studied with Pavlov because he totally misrepresented what he claimed to have learned—was the founder of behaviorism in America. J.B. Watson denied the existence of consciousness. Even my professors in the university psychology department were still denying consciousness, or at least denying it to children. They said that consciousness was only present in speech.

This picture of Pavlov as studying "conditioned reflexes" goes back to Watson's misrepresentation. The translation of Pavlov's phrase was deliberately misleading. If you translate it back into Russian, it says "conditional reflex," meaning that you reflect on all the conditions around you. In other words, consciousness was the meaning of Pavlov's term, yet consciousness was explicitly defined out of his system by the West.

## Randomness vs. Purpose in Evolution

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same attempt to hide the problem has been going on in genetics. Genetics has attempted to evade the problem of where life came from in the first place simply by emphasizing that units are passed on which are identical to the units that preceded them. When they are forced to recognize change, very strange devices have developed.

The idealization of randomness—random change, random mutation—took over biological genetic thinking for about 80 years. The idea was: if we have to admit that life changes, and maybe even that life originated from non-life, we are going to say it is random because we don't really want to admit that it happens.

The big controversy between the Neo-Darwinists and the Lamarckians was this same thing. The Neo-Darwinists even rewrote Darwin. They took out the Lamarckian inclinations of Darwin—that's why they call it Neo-Darwinism, because Darwin would be too Lamarckian for their preferences.

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe for our listeners, you should give a brief synopsis of Lamarckianism and Darwinism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lamarck basically said that life is purposeful, and that the intention to do something is part of the process of physiological adaptation. This attempt to adapt to an environment is part of what is passed on to the offspring.

Darwin accepted that there were many sources of variation, including the Lamarckian type. Darwin didn't say that variation was just by chance; he enumerated a whole bunch of mechanisms that could cause variation. But after Mendel's work with peas—which people have pointed out wasn't even truthful; he fudged his results to make it look mathematically perfect—people reinvented Darwin to support their position that change and evolution are random.

One of the recent manifestations of this strange religion of random changes is the craze about the idea of chaos. They use purely numerical processes to argue that you can't predict the future. Then they say particles, atoms, and things in the real world are just like numbers. That is what the genetics people did: they said the particles we are dealing with are just like numbers, and individual particles don't know where they are going, so they can only change randomly. They are reducing everything to the most meaningless unit.

## Oparin, Coacervation, and Self-Organization

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meanwhile, other people were thinking about the actual physics, chemistry, geology, and cosmology operating in everyday life. Oparin is one of the people well known in the theory of the origin of life. In the 20s, 30s, and 40s, he was talking about the types of physical processes that can create things equivalent to cells. He discussed the idea of coacervation, or clumping in complex colloid-like systems that find organization in a complex way. This allows complex structures to appear out of what seem to be simple random solutions.

Probably these people talking about coacervation were the first to introduce the idea of self-organization and self-structuring, in which entropy actually decreases according to ordinary physical processes. Once you add a few complexifying ingredients to a solution of starch, oil, or protein molecules, order starts appearing. You have to see the history of denying that entropy can decrease as part of this philosophy of idealizing randomness.

Vernadsky was working along this synthesizing route. In the 1920s, he was lecturing on the place of consciousness in the cosmos. He showed that, according to well-recognized principles, consciousness is generated by physical forces. He used the ideas of the biosphere and the *noosphere*. Teilhard de Chardin happened to be in Paris where Vernadsky was lecturing, and he popularized the idea of the noosphere. But it was this cosmic realist philosophy of the biogeochemist that really generated the central idea of what the noosphere is in relation to the biosphere.

**John Barkhausen:** So Chardin used the word noosphere, but he didn't really come up with the final meaning of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He turned it into a fairly revolutionary religious idea, but he left out the physical principles that explain it. He left it in a very abstract form.

## Sidney Fox and the Origin of Life

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the outcomes of Oparin's work was the American Sidney Fox. He was the fruition of some of these experiments regarding how physical conditions affect the appearance of order out of disorder.

I should mention that one of the people Vernadsky knew in Paris was Henri Le Chatelier. Everyone hears about Le Chatelier's principle: anything you do to disturb an equilibrium causes the system to adjust in a way that restores equilibrium. Vernadsky, thinking cosmologically, realized that heat is coming out of the inside of the Earth and the sun is constantly adding energy to the system. If you are constantly pushing on the system with volcanic and solar energy, you don't have a closed system. The system is being driven and steered by this constant pressure of energy. Vernadsky said the system will adjust in ways that restore equilibrium, creating bigger, smarter, more intensely metabolizing organisms to equilibrate the energy being added.

Sidney Fox used Vernadsky's principles. About 40 years ago, everyone was talking about life originating in a "tepid pond" or a warm ocean sparked by lightning—random events. Sidney Fox intended to rethink how proteins come into existence. If you have a protein floating in water, the equilibrium is to degrade into individual amino acids. The equilibrium is not favorable for large molecules if they are floating in water.

Fox put dry amino acids—deficient in water—on hot lava in a model of volcanic energy. He showed that heat in the absence of water creates protein-like long polymerized molecules. The equilibrium is absolutely the opposite in the deficiency of water.

One of my professors, Sidney Bernhard, revolutionized cell physiology by demonstrating that glycolytic enzymes are at a higher concentration in cells than the substrate sugar they work on. Everyone had been diluting these enzymes in water, but he showed that the concentration totally changes the equilibrium.

Sidney Fox demonstrated that relatively dry heat creates order and protein-like molecules. When he added water, the proteins spontaneously formed tiny bacteria-like particles, almost all the same size—he called them proteinoid microspheres. Over 20 years, he showed that these molecules have enzyme-like properties. The amino acids polymerize in a non-random fashion. The growing molecule "selects" the next amino acid.

He added the precursors of genetic material and showed that these would be catalyzed into chains. So, you have the reverse situation where genes come *last*, after you've already created cells that can metabolize and reproduce.

**John Barkhausen:** He basically originated life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You put the proteinoid microspheres in a solution with amino acids, and they assimilate nutrients, grow, and when they reach a size where they are no longer stable, they bud or divide. He did this in the 60s, and it was mentioned in Lehninger's Biochemistry textbook (1968 edition). Now, the new Lehninger book has deleted that material because it doesn't fit their concept.

**John Barkhausen:** I would think what Sidney Fox did would be headline news.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was for me.

**John Barkhausen:** It seems this divide between the two philosophies is like the reductionist versus the holist—someone who looks at the whole organism rather than dividing it into mechanistic parts. It also seems like science is afraid of sounding religious.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fred Hoyle said it would be hard to avoid thinking of the cosmos as essentially a biological thing, except that people can't stand the thought that the universe itself is purposeful and alive.

**John Barkhausen:** I wonder why. People are drawn to religion because it gives a purpose to life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was where Teilhard de Chardin made a big contribution by being both a scientist and a religious thinker. Unfortunately, some people have replaced the noosphere with the Gaia hypothesis. The Gaia hypothesis says the Earth is like a conscious being, but it's not going anywhere; it's just trying to maintain itself—homeostasis versus creation.

Vernadsky's view is that the Earth and sun are driving evolution as a system. If you delete parts of the system, the whole 4 billion years might go to waste. The Gaia/randomness people tend to say whatever happens is okay because random events have wiped out species in the past.

## Kozyrev and the Energy of Time

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vernadsky's principles were extensions of Le Chatelier's principle. He showed that the migration of atoms and the intensity of metabolism were subdivisions of this principle.

An astronomer, Nikolai Kozyrev, did his doctoral dissertation around 1950 on the energy of stars. He asked: What if we assume the universe is not necessarily running down? What if we assume that time physically is a real, asymmetric factor in all systems? He reasoned that the mere passage of time distinguishes one state of a system from another in a real physical way.

Using standard Einsteinian arguments, he applied this to the energy of stars. He suggested that the passage of time adds something to the system. He concluded that time itself is the source of stellar energy. He predicted that Jupiter and Neptune would be emitting more heat than they received, and that each planet would have internal heat in proportion to its mass.

Scaling it down to the Moon, he predicted occasional volcanic eruptions. He trained his spectrometer on the dark phases of the Moon and recorded hot emissions, confirming his prediction. His physics should be taken into account in thinking about volcanic energy.

## Consciousness and Fields

**John Barkhausen:** We have a caller on the line. Do you have a question or comment?

**Caller:** Yes. I'm curious about the idea of consciousness and its relationship to the brain. The scientific paradigm is that consciousness is an epiphenomenon of physiochemical processes and is self-referential. However, no one has been able to locate memory in the brain. Penfield operated on epileptic patients and came to espouse interactionism—that mind and brain are interactive but different, and memories might exist in some type of field.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My personal history is part of where my ideas come from. Before I discovered that thyroid was very important in my metabolism, I was a hyper-metabolic individual. I would burn perhaps 10,000 calories a day. I had an electrical field around my body that would affect physical things like millivolt meters two feet away. I couldn't operate the apparatus; my lab partner had to do it because it would go off-scale when I got near.

All of this stopped when I took the right amount of thyroid. My metabolism became regulated. But I saw that oxidative metabolism generated this potentially immense field around cells. This inclined me to see the importance of bioelectric fields in development and physiology. For example, there is a field concept of cancer—research shows it is an electromagnetic field, at least in part, that creates precancerous conditions or governs the development of an embryo.

**Caller:** That idea has been taken up by Rupert Sheldrake with his theory of formative causation—that information can be shared among members of a species.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From Vernadsky's perspective, the supplementary context is that things are ready to be discovered. When you change components in the system, many things contribute, not just the individual's consciousness. Vernadsky would emphasize multi-causal factors.

**Caller:** You seem to be skirting around a scientific taboo: the evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely, they are a fact, and Darwin knew it. People slandered Lamarck and took him down because of the implications of his empirical, physiological approach. The same thing happened to Paul Kammerer. C.P. Lindegren wrote *Cold War in Biology*, which is the best American book on the subject.

## Genetics, Eugenics, and IQ

**Caller:** The public is being led to believe in genetic determinism—the "selfish gene"—where a gene is responsible for a specific quality. As far as I know, no one has proved that genes do anything except organize the synthesis of proteins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been interested in this for more than 50 years. The motivation for a lot of these ideas around 1910 to 1920 was to stop immigration of Eastern and Southern Europeans to the United States. They created IQ tests and "showed" that 85% of Russians, Jews, and others were feeble-minded. These tests were explicitly designed for racist, exclusionary purposes.

Many of these people persisted in universities. *The Bell Curve* is a recent example. When I sent a letter to *Science* magazine criticizing a genetic determination article, the referees rejected my comments citing data from Hitler's Racial Hygiene Institute. That got me interested in studying that period. I saw that Konrad Lorenz was the architect of racial hygiene; he created the rationale for exterminating "inferior" people. Lorenz was a Nazi, and in his later books, he repeated the exact arguments of his 1942 papers on genocide.

**Caller:** The ideology has survived, but shorn of terms like "eugenics."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I went to a lecture in the 70s where Gunther Stent presented Konrad Lorenz's arguments for genocide as the ultimate in understanding the brain genetically. My professors were happily agreeing. When I pointed out the logical irrationalities, they asked if I was saying the fact that he was a Nazi had anything to do with the validity of his ideas.

## Social Darwinism and Economics

**Caller:** It seems the official ideology is compounded of misinterpretations of Darwin and Adam Smith. Adam Smith believed in self-interest, but also in benevolence as a counterpoint. Yet only the self-interest part is promoted. Similarly, Alfred Russel Wallace could not accept the idea of an entirely mechanical evolutionary process driven by randomness.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't just Neo-Darwinism and Smith; it is everything in our intellectual history. I've read textbooks in many fields, and 99% of them are ideological distortions, rewriting history to leave out everything interesting or threatening to the established system. Adam Smith, Darwin, Pavlov—if they were good, they have to be distorted. If they were too good, they have to be left out entirely.

**Caller:** Science developed as a reaction against religious provincialism, but it seems to have turned into an ideology itself—Scientism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They got one little success, but then decided to give in to the backward cultural forces. Most scientists have accepted the fundamental assumptions of the people who used those assumptions for religious purposes. It works by eliminating all the troubling, complexifying things and reducing everything to random variation and survival of the fittest.

**Caller:** Randomness is based on infinite time. But most mutations are regressive. It seems like a series of improbabilities linked together to explain how we get flies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vernadsky shows that species will arise quickly to the limits of the resources available. Evolution is driven in a practically instantaneous way. The driving environmental force—energy disturbing the equilibrium—is so powerful that evolution is fast and directional.

## Mechanisms of Ordering

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at it in the context of energy added to the system, there are physical principles like hysteresis (system memory) and long-range order. A surface projects a field or ordering influence into the surrounding environment.

Michael Polanyi's absorption isotherm was ignored, but he showed that surfaces project their influence. One of my professors showed that you can lay a plastic membrane over a crystal and evaporate a chemical on top; the atoms appear ordered, taking on the characteristics of the crystal beneath the plastic. The crystal projects a field through space that orders the atoms.

**Caller:** So there is a consciousness inherent in matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alexander Rothen devised a way of measuring this ordering influence projected through membranes. The mechanism seems to be that electrons on an atom resonate, inducing a field in the next atom, which projects off into space.

**Caller:** That relates to the discovery that heart cells in close proximity influence each other without touching.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, the Gurwitsches demonstrated that cells could communicate through a quartz window.

**Caller:** We don't have a mechanism that can explain communication between cells that aren't chemically or electrically linked.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually the missing piece is that the researcher is too dull-minded to measure what might be relevant, such as the phase of the moon or outside conditions.

## Abiotic Oil and Volcanic Life

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two more aspects of the origin of life I wanted to mention. The submarine vent biologists, if you link them with Vernadsky and Sidney Fox, suggest that volcanic processes are creating organisms.

Mendeleev noticed that dissolving iron in acid produced the smell of crude petroleum. He sent samples to chemists who identified it as petroleum. The carbon atoms dissolved in hot iron were catalyzed into petroleum. Thomas Gold, an American geologist, argued that petroleum is being constantly created by this mechanism in the depths of the Earth. He pointed out you can find petroleum in granite where it shouldn't be unless it is being synthesized from below.

**Caller:** He believes it's not a fossil residue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The traditional idea is that petroleum is marine biological fossil residue. But the Gold/Mendeleev/Vernadsky interpretation is that the Earth is generating new petroleum. If you think of Sidney Fox's work where cells are generated by volcanic heat, you have organic sources of energy and organisms that can eat carbon dioxide being generated volcanically.

**Caller:** That interfaces with the bion experiments of Wilhelm Reich.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sidney Fox's organisms—any high school student can produce little cells that will eat and reproduce in a few hours.

**Caller:** So spontaneous generation is not completely bad?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not at all. I think volcanoes are churning out life all the time.

**Caller:** Amazing. I'll hang up now. Thank you.

**John Barkhausen:** Thank you for calling. Ray, did you get to say everything you needed to say?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Briefly, I think I touched on everything regarding the origin of life. I might mention the work of Lancelot Law Whyte. He wrote books on the philosophy of physics and biology, talking about the formative principle as something overlooked by conventional science.

**John Barkhausen:** Are his books available?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are in good libraries.

**John Barkhausen:** That was really fascinating. I want to thank you for coming on again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.

**John Barkhausen:** That was Dr. Raymond Peat. You can find his work at raypeat.com. Thanks for listening to Politics and Science.
