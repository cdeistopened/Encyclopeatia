## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Hello and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm John Barkhausen, your host, and today we're going to talk about some autoimmune diseases and movement disorder dysfunctions. I'm intrigued by them not only because I have friends that are suffering from these, but also because the medical world offers so little knowledge about the diseases and so little hope or practical knowledge in terms of treatment.

I'm very happy that Dr. Raymond Peat is here to join me again today. Dr. Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon and extensive knowledge of science history. There are many theories as to the causes of the diseases, and one common factor that is present in all of them—and that most people agree on—is inflammation. Ray, I just want to start off by asking you: why is so little understood about these diseases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, I think there's a lot more known than the public is aware of. The medical journals aren't a good place to look if you're just wanting to find out how much is known. If you read widely in not only medical journals but general science journals, you see that people have discovered really interesting things about all of them. There are patterns that show up across the various diseases, and I think things could be put into practice more than they are.

There are people demonstrating improvement in the degenerative diseases with very simple antioxidant supplements and creatine supplements that you just don't hear about in the *New York Times* stories about advances in health. I think part of it is that when the generic substance looks like it might prevent or cure one of these horrible conditions, the drug industry isn't interested, and so there's no advertising money to be made by running publicity about it.

**John Barkhausen:** So nobody pursues it. Ray, can you explain where you're finding out this knowledge of hopeful techniques to combat these diseases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of it you can find right in PubMed and Google, and some of it in more obscure journals. There's enough to keep a person busy for years just putting pieces together, making a meaningful puzzle out of scraps from the various lines of thinking.

If you follow one disease over 20 or 30 years, like Alzheimer's, you'll see there are styles focusing on the cholinergic nerve death, or the accumulating fibrils, amyloid and such, and explaining that as a toxin that causes the disease. Each disease goes through its styles of what they think is interesting. But the pressure on funding research pushes generally towards a genetic explanation that makes a simple drug solution conceivable—something to stop that one genetic defect from taking its effect.

## Genetics, Evolution, and "Styles" of Research

**John Barkhausen:** So when you say styles, are you talking about certain fads in research that are prevalent at certain times?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, definitely fads. But the basic big fad that has lasted for 100 years is a genetic explanation. Like in Huntington's disease, it's a certain repeat that causes a series of glutamine amino acids in the protein to increase, and that creates a protein that shows up as if it's doing damage. The framework idea is that the gene expresses itself in a protein, and the protein causes the symptoms of the disease.

But there are several ways of approaching that. One is that something is causing this repeat to be formed in the gene itself. For example, even though Huntington's is thought to set in at the age of 40 or so, they notice that the children of those people develop about eight years earlier. Each generation anticipates and starts the condition earlier. So there's something causing that repeat and the protein to increase each generation.

That is something that's slow to sink into the genetic causality—that things are happening right now, each generation creating a tendency to mutate in a certain direction. There were many genetic theories that said that mutations do have a directionality. They used to explain the growth of antlers on [certain species] as getting bigger and bigger because of some tendency in the organism to go in a certain direction. Orthogenesis, they called it. But that was sort of vaguely anti-Darwinian and inclined towards Lamarckism, so it dropped out.

The idea of a defect in the gene that causes it to get worse and worse quickly with each generation is more acceptable because, in immunology, that was a solution to how antibodies can adapt so quickly to any conceivable infection or antigen. They said they have to adapt by mutating so fast that they can evolve in just a few days to match whatever antigen they're exposed to. So this idea of almost directed mutation got put into genetics by way of immunology. John Cairns and Ted Steele are the people known to be working on the idea of directed mutations in a constructive way, not just destructive.

**John Barkhausen:** I'm awfully confused by this because I think of geneticists as saying, in the past at least, that genes were a permanent thing passed down from generation to generation and could not be changed easily.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have been open to the idea, but they're still not seeing it as anything deliberate or constructive, just a way the defect can develop. It's a way to save the genetic causality, rather than seeing that the same thing causing the symptoms of the disease might also be causing the genes to change in the same direction. That's what they don't want to see: a link between the way the gene changes and the function of the protein in the life of the individual organism. That implies Lamarckism.

**John Barkhausen:** You mean that the organism is directing the gene mutation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Or that something is causing the organism on the cellular, not genetic, level to change, and at the same time, the gene that regulates that cellular function is changing in the same direction. They shouldn't be coordinated that way so that the function and the gene change simultaneously, or even with the information going from the function into the gene.

**John Barkhausen:** Because that would mean that the organism is a purposive being on the evolutionary level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. That's the whole point. Ever since the anti-Darwinians in the 19th century—Weismann in particular—they hated the idea that things could be changing meaningfully or purposefully, and wanted to say that there is no real change. Genes were the way of proving that. You might get a different mixture of traits, but the traits are eternal and the gene is what causes that.

One of the people questioning this, James Shapiro, was working in ordinary bacterial genetics. He noticed that individuals exposed to an antibiotic could become resistant to it and that they could pass that information on very intentionally to their neighbors. It could even cross varieties of one bacteria to another and spread through whole systems. That got him thinking about this idea of purposive change. He proposed that the organism does genetic engineering along the lines of what Barbara McClintock was talking about. He says this is the general way genetics works in the organism—that the organism is its own genetic engineer doing changes for its own benefit.

**John Barkhausen:** I can believe it. I was looking today at a physiology book trying to understand the nervous system, and it's pretty phenomenal. If you open up an encyclopedia and look at how the nervous system is laid out, it's an awe-inspiring system. The idea that some scientists and philosophers think that happened by random evolutionary trial and error seems impossible to my mind.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The establishment genetics biology system, including most of medicine, are attacking James Shapiro with his application of the Barbara McClintock way of thinking. Randomness is such a deep part of their way of thinking that they are accusing Shapiro of being a creationist. He says, well, the creationists sometimes speak very reasonably, and sometimes the so-called neo-Darwinians don't speak so scientifically and reasonably.

**John Barkhausen:** I don't personally buy into the father figure in the sky looking down on us all.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but he's saying the organism itself has intelligence.

**John Barkhausen:** That to me has the ring of truth to it. As you look around the world and see the world organizing itself, it's a good example of the intelligence all around us. One of the things that interested me was what Carl Lindegren said in his book *Cold War in Biology*, which was that in order to practice science back in the 40s and 50s in the United States, it was very helpful to profess some kind of belief in a God in order to keep your job. He said that professors were afraid to say they were an atheist or agnostic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, all of my professors were churchgoers. In the 19th century, biologists specifically tended to be agnostics. But it really did get a religious boost in the 1940s. They considered it anti-materialist, but what it was was a different kind of materialism: randomness-based materialism rather than the idea that material is part of the purposive, intelligent life process.

## Inflammation and Energy Deficiency

**John Barkhausen:** Bringing this back to our topic today and talking about the inflammation that appears to be present in all of these diseases—whether we're talking about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), or Rheumatoid Arthritis. All these diseases involve inflammation. Maybe you could outline for us how science has perceived inflammation over the years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the middle of the 20th century, there was a heavy concentration on inflammation as a reaction to infection. About 35 or 40 years ago, when I mentioned to a recent graduate something about "sterile inflammation," she wouldn't let me continue and said, "There's no such thing as sterile inflammation."

But 100 years before, people were demonstrating that you could extract something from infectious organisms that would create inflammation even if it was sterile. Then with radiation experiments, they found that radiation produced inflammation, or trauma. Completely sterile burns or shutting off the blood supply creates inflammation.

I think the only way to approach inflammation is to think of it as a gap that shouldn't exist between the demands made on the cells or the tissue and the resources to meet those demands. If you traumatize or overstimulate tissue, or if you don't provide enough sugar, oxygen, and carbon dioxide to meet that stimulation, then things go wrong. The tissue becomes edematous and chain reactions happen that can kill the tissue. Or, if the organism can manage to recruit enough systems to provide sugar and stop the excitation, then it can heal. A little inflammation rouses the organism to cause regeneration. Otherwise, it can lead to fibrosis and atrophy.

**John Barkhausen:** Let's use an example of one of these diseases, like Multiple Sclerosis. The myelin sheath, for some unknown reason according to the medical authorities, becomes worn away and the nerves stop functioning. They say it's caused by inflammation. How does that relate to your idea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something that causes a lack of energy will cause tissue to swell up and take up water. As it swells up, the tissue tries to renew itself. Cells are always renewing themselves in a tremendous churning process of taking down the old stuff and putting up new stuff. Someone said that during the night, 60% of the fat substance in our brain is totally resynthesized. Just an hour after death, a massive amount of the brain substance has decomposed because it isn't constantly being reconstituted. So you have to think of a healthy, stable organism as being in extremely intense turnover processes.

If you cut off the energy supply, the first thing that happens is the cell takes up water, and that excites the restorative process to run faster. But if it takes up more and more water, that shifts the whole direction. The cell at a certain stage of excitation will de-differentiate or try to turn into a stem cell to grow new tissue as a healing process. If there's even less energy, then that process stops.

When you have just a chronic, slight energy deprivation, you get a chronic, slight edema. One of the things that happens is that the myelin swells up, and while it's being taken down, it isn't being resynthesized efficiently. Thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone, and saturated fatty acids are things that support the reforming of the myelin. When the energy is down—for example, thyroid is low—then you can't make the pregnenolone and progesterone, so you just can't synthesize it as fast as it's being taken down.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's really a condition where you're put under stress and you don't have the energy resources to keep rebuilding yourself under that stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And it's remarkably similar to the processes in the degenerative brain diseases of aging, the development of cancer, deforming arthritis, chronic inflammation like pancreatitis, hepatitis, chronic kidney disease, and so on. All the same processes are involved, just in different proportions of energy supply and irritation or stimulation.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that what Hans Selye referred to as the condition of being sick?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhausen:** And that's just a shortage of energy, basically.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the gap between stimulation and energy resources has been used to define excitotoxicity that kills brain cells. But it's really the same process in your pancreas, kidney, or skin. Exactly the same energy systems, slight differences in the particular proteins.

In Huntington's disease, there's that polyglutamine repeat that accumulates, but it's really just a symptom of an inflammatory state with a particular history that leads to that being a problem. The fact that it usually waits until you're 40 years old means that—same with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease—they almost never develop in little kids. It takes a while being exposed to certain environments for each kind of thing to develop.

But there are a few common factors in the organism involved in almost all of these: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's, Huntington's, and MS. Even diabetes involves inflammation and the failure to regenerate properly. The beta cells are being killed in the same way that brain cells are being killed. Instead of making insulin as the cells are renewed, the cells are killed as fast as they're renewed, so they stop making insulin. But if you stop killing them, then they can start making insulin again. Same with the brain.

I might have mentioned a man with ALS that I talked to about eight or ten years ago. He was 70 years old and had all the best neurologists examine him. He was absolutely convinced he had Lou Gehrig's disease and was declining the same as other people he met in the neurology offices. He decided to start doing things to stop inflammation and support repair. He did them consistently for a few months while still declining, but then he stopped declining, and within a few months was repaired. Less than a year for the whole process. The people he had met in the neurology offices with the same rate of decline were totally disabled by the time he was totally recovered.

## Blood Sugar, Fats, and Thyroid Function

**John Barkhausen:** That's impressive. One of the things you've talked about in terms of helping your body rebuild is a very simple thing: keeping your blood sugar up. Maybe you can describe what happens when somebody is low on blood sugar. Reading you talk about the catabolic effect that happens just from low blood sugar is pretty convincing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your blood sugar falls because your liver hasn't stored enough glycogen to turn into glucose, the first reaction is for adrenaline to increase to try to squeeze more glycogen into your circulation for your brain. When the glycogen is absolutely gone, the adrenaline keeps activating the breakdown of fat and provides increased amounts of circulating fat to make up for the lack of sugar.

But after the fat becomes a source of energy, your cells still need some sugar to maintain their basic processes. So they turn protein into sugar. To do that, they increase cortisol, which breaks down muscle, skin, and the thymus gland. The thymus is the first to go. The cortisol will eat up your muscle, skin, and immune system pretty quickly to feed your heart, lungs, and brain to keep them alive.

Every time your blood sugar falls, you're shifting over to fat metabolism and breaking down protein. Muscles are one of the places that store glycogen, so as your muscles get smaller, more burden is put on your liver to keep your blood sugar steady. That makes your liver progressively suffer. Eventually, it gets to the point that your brain isn't getting the right energy or the right *kind* of energy.

One of the things that happens with aging is that we progressively change our fat composition. At birth, we're very highly saturated in our fats because they've been formed from glucose in utero. We can only make saturated, monounsaturated, and omega-9 unsaturated fats when we're supplied with sugar or protein. But once we start eating in the ordinary environment, our tissues start loading up on the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) from the environment.

By the time a person is 40, the brain is pretty full of either the arachidonic acid series or, if they have eaten a lot of fish, the long, highly unsaturated fats—mostly the DHA type of fish oil-derived omega-3 fats. Even with a pretty average diet, the old person's brain is very highly biased towards the DHA type fats.

If you look at Parkinson's disease, their favorite genetic protein that some people like to say is the cause—synuclein—is the Parkinson's equivalent of the glutamine repeat of Huntington's or the amyloid of Alzheimer's. Each disease tends to have its own protein that goes haywire. In the case of Parkinson's, it's the alpha-synuclein. DHA, the fish type of unsaturated fat, causes the synuclein protein to change to its toxic form that appears in Parkinson's disease. Saturated fats tend to protect against that. So very clearly in Parkinson's, you can see the role of fat in inclining the brain towards that degenerative change.

Since pretty much everyone in the environment accumulates these highly unsaturated fats, especially in the brain, by the time you're 30 or 40, you become more and more susceptible to all of the degenerative inflammatory diseases very much in proportion to the unsaturated fats. You can find the breakdown products corresponding to the seriousness of Alzheimer's, Huntington's, or MS. The specific breakdown products, such as acrolein which comes largely from the omega-3 fats, show that these unstable fats are breaking down at an increased rate in the degenerative brain conditions.

**John Barkhausen:** You've also said that in that cascade of bad effects from low blood sugar, after the free fatty acids are released, that actually pulls down your whole thyroid system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A series of studies in France about 25 to 30 years ago showed that exactly in proportion to the number of double bonds in a fat—increasing from a purely saturated fat such as stearic or palmitic acid, through oleic acid, up increasing with linoleic, and greatly with the five and six double bonds—each increased double bond impairs the thyroid function at the level of secretion, transport, and response. They looked at four different systems, but every one of these was impaired in proportion to the degree of unsaturation of the free fatty acids in the blood.

**John Barkhausen:** When was that study done, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 80s, in *Annals of Endocrinology*, a French journal.

**John Barkhausen:** Well, they are traditionally the kings of using saturated fat in their cooking. French cuisine is known for its use of butter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The French have fallen for the propaganda against saturated fats and cholesterol. Some of their famous fat researchers were convinced that giving a fish oil supplement to pregnant women would make their babies smarter, even though animal studies showed that in proportion to the unsaturation of the fat in the pregnant animal's diet, the babies' brains were smaller and less able to learn.

The French fed some pregnant women the unsaturated fats while measuring the fetus's ability to react to sounds applied to the abdomen. They found that, contrary to what they believed would happen, the learning was impaired by the diet with more of the highly unsaturated fats. And when the babies were born, in line with the animal experiments, their growth was retarded.

**John Barkhausen:** That seems really immoral to be testing that theory out on infants and their mothers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The publicity of the animal studies has pretty much suppressed the fact that these fats didn't have consistently good effects on brain and eye development. What got publicized were the few studies showing what were interpreted to be good results. On the basis of that, the baby food industry was allowed to add these things to their powdered milk for making baby formula. But even in the powdered milk, they're so unstable that toxic oxidation fragments are tremendously increased. Still, the publicity is such that they're promoted as protective.

**John Barkhausen:** So currently, baby formula that people are using has the DHA oils in them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of them do. I don't know if there are some without it.

**John Barkhausen:** That's a little discouraging. I can see adults going along with different fads and trying things out for themselves, but when you start experimenting with infants, it seems like not a very good idea.

## Estrogen, Progesterone, and Aging

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things that happens at the same time these unsaturated fats are accumulating in the body is that the ratio of estrogen to progesterone is increasing. By the time a woman is 40, her estrogen is even higher in an absolute sense than it was when she was 20. But even worse is that her progesterone has decreased. So the ratio is shifted very powerfully in the direction of estrogen.

Estrogen happens to synergize with the polyunsaturated fats. These polyunsaturateds activate the action of a given amount of estrogen and at the same time interfere with the production of progesterone and suppress thyroid. Lower thyroid increases estrogen and decreases progesterone.

But the estrogen industry has convinced most doctors that estrogen is good for the brain and for preventing heart disease and strokes. So when the Women's Health Initiative pointed out that estrogen supplements increased dementia, heart attacks, and strokes—reinforcing what animal studies had shown—the medical establishment took two or three years to respond and come back and say what must have been wrong with that study.

**John Barkhausen:** That's what they're saying now, that the study was wrong.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is very heavy propaganda to improve the sales of estrogen, which dropped off drastically when that study came out.

**John Barkhausen:** That was a very convincing study.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Especially because it absolutely corroborated the animal research going back 50 years before then.

**John Barkhausen:** And these diseases we're talking about today affect women way more than they affect men. I think MS is 10 to 1.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even Alzheimer's. In the 90s, it was already well documented that women had two or two and a half times the incidence of Alzheimer's disease as men. In spite of that, the people who wanted to sell estrogen said, "Well, that's because women's estrogen declines with aging." But in fact, by the age of 40, it has increased tremendously. And that's when the brain damage is being done by the bad ratio of estrogen to progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** I know you've covered this before, Ray, but explain how it is that people think estrogen is declining when it actually isn't. It's increasing and the tests just don't pick it up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One thing is that the estrogen is stuck. When it's in the cells working, it's bound to the things they call estrogen receptors. Progesterone's effect, which should rise right after ovulation, destroys or decomposes the estrogen binding proteins and activates enzymes that inactivate estrogen, getting it out of the cells. So if you're deficient in progesterone, you can't get estrogen out of the cells.

It not only stays there, but it tends to activate enzymes that create more estrogen. Your aromatase in your fat tissue, fibrous tissue, and various tissues increases, making estrogen outside of the ovaries as you age. Even in a young monkey, they were studying the estrogen output in the ovary and as a control, they used the blood coming from the arm veins. They found that the monkey's arm was producing more estrogen than its ovary was. That process increases with age.

When you're deficient in progesterone, most of the estrogen stays inside cells working, rather than getting out into the blood where it could be excreted. The only way you can really tell how much estrogen influence a person has when they're 50 years old is to take a snip of tissue and analyze its estrogen content.

**John Barkhausen:** And on top of our bodies producing more estrogen as we age, we have a huge environmental load coming down on us because many of the chemicals we use in our modern lifestyle are estrogenic. Plus pollution is estrogenic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, before the estrogen industry took off, people were studying what estrogen is and does. They found that soot is estrogenic. Things that produce the estrogen effect produce inflammation and cancer. Basically, it's a process of cell excitation followed or accompanied by blocking oxidative energy production. That was pretty much covered up when the estrogen industry convinced doctors that estrogen was the female hormone that would prevent infertility and aging.

## Mechanisms of Damage: Transglutaminase and CO2

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The interaction of estrogen as an excitatory thing with the polyunsaturated fats—which are also excitatory things besides producing inflammation and blocking energy production—activates other systems. For example, the glutamate/glutamic acid system. That is why monosodium glutamate (MSG) produces brain injury; it excites cells to the point that if there's not enough energy supply, the cells will die.

Estrogen and the unsaturated fats both activate this glutamate excitatory system. Those interact to increase a set of enzymes called transglutaminase. This is the enzyme involved in celiac disease, the gluten sensitivity disease. This enzyme is normally involved in maturing cells that are under the influence of stress, as in the surface of the skin when it's maturing into a hardened keratinized layer, or in the uterus as estrogen is causing the lining to mature.

But in the brain, this excitation from unsaturated fats, lipid peroxidation breakdown, estrogen, and the glutamic acid system excites the formation of transglutaminase. Transglutaminase happens to form polymers and fibrils and deposits of these various enzymes that are known to accumulate in Huntington's, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and MS.

The tau protein in Alzheimer's disease, for example: transglutaminase activates a reaction that causes these proteins to accumulate and form fibrils. This enzyme works on amino groups. When the metabolism is healthy and producing energy by the use of oxidative metabolism, it's producing a constant supply of carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide spontaneously combines with amino groups. Every protein in the body should have its supply of carbon dioxide, preventing the action of enzymes such as transglutaminase which would bind them and cause them to condense and form fibrils.

I suspect that in places where estrogen is dominant, or in the skin where the cells are exposed to pure air, the carbon dioxide is displaced either by the effect of estrogen or just by the high saturation of oxygen. The absence of the carbon dioxide allows this transglutaminase to cross-link, inactivate, and harden the proteins. But when it happens inside your brain, you get these abnormal deposits of protein that should only happen in cells that are terminally differentiating and getting ready to slough off.

**John Barkhausen:** So CO2 is very important to the health of the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a survey in Nepal at very high altitudes. They found lots of sick people, but they didn't find the degenerative brain diseases that you would expect at lower altitude, poor populations. I suspect that it's because when you adapt to high altitude, your body retains a much higher level of carbon dioxide. Your blood is more in the carbamino state, but probably all your proteins are.

**John Barkhausen:** And you've said that reduced thyroid function—not having enough of the active thyroid hormone, T3—is when you start having trouble not only with energy levels but also the myelin sheath. Your nerves can't regenerate without the T3. Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The first five people that I met who had a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, I was starting to believe there wasn't such a thing as multiple sclerosis because all of those first five people had such classical symptoms of hypothyroidism. When they took thyroid, their symptoms totally disappeared. So it's very easy to confuse hypothyroidism with multiple sclerosis.

## Practical Steps for Health

**John Barkhausen:** In the few minutes we have left, Raymond, maybe you could just run over what are some of the simple things people can do to alleviate their symptoms or even avoid them entirely?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it's known that aspirin prevents most of these degenerative conditions. People who have chronically used some aspirin are much less likely to have Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Caffeine is another generally protective thing against inflammation, fibrosis, and degeneration.

Avoidance of the polyunsaturated fats, I think, is the basic and most important thing. And avoiding anti-thyroid foods. The worst anti-thyroid foods are these polyunsaturated fats.

**John Barkhausen:** And keeping your protein level up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And gelatin seems to have a therapeutic anti-inflammatory effect. Eating the cheapest cuts of meat, bones, and skin. In the US, few people eat the skin, and since the fat avoidance fad, people tend to eat skinless chicken. When the animals are fed a good diet, the skin fat is more saturated. Pork rinds are a very good source of gelatin. If you boil a chicken, the skin and bones will release a lot of gelatin, which is an anti-inflammatory, protective protein.

**John Barkhausen:** And you mentioned how important it is to keep your blood sugar up to handle stresses. How should one do that? I have a feeling that a lot of our problems today are because people are avoiding sugar because it's gotten such a bad rap.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Every day I hear at least one or two people saying what happened when they started eating sugar. One man said his hair stopped falling out a couple of days after he started eating sugar. A kid who was having seizures and had gone down to 112 pounds in just two or three weeks is back up to his normal weight for eating something like 8 or 9 ounces of sugar added to his other foods in a crisis.

Sugar in itself—just simple honey or sugar—can be very therapeutic. But in general, you want to shift your diet towards fruit rather than grains and starchy vegetables.

**John Barkhausen:** Just to finish up, you were saying that starches are a bad way to get sugar. Like wheat is bad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Partly because of the other things they're associated with. But one of the things they do harmfully is to support bacterial growth. The poorly cooked starches or the more undercooked vegetables and complex forms of starch support bacterial growth. The bacteria produce endotoxin, and endotoxin works with these other pro-inflammatory things.

Some of the structural changes of the degenerative proteins are very similar to the structure that is defensive against endotoxin. So some of them might be provoked by the presence of endotoxin as a defensive reaction. It's well known that the polyunsaturated fats activate prion formation and so on, but the unsaturated fats are probably biologically analogous to the endotoxin produced by the bacteria.

**John Barkhausen:** Yes. And you've written a lot about the relationship of maldigestion of food creating a lot of the problems that we've been talking about or helping to exacerbate them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And the unsaturated fats contribute even at the digestive level because they interfere with protein digestive enzymes as well as after they get into the bloodstream.

**John Barkhausen:** Well, we've filled up the hour, Ray. It's gone very fast. I really appreciate you coming on Politics and Science again. Perhaps at some point we can follow up and get into some of the details of how digestion does relate to disease because I think that's something that the medical world doesn't cover at all.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you go back to the mid-19th century, you see that medicine was really making progress. Then into the 20th century, the Russians were continuing digestive physiology, but after about the 1920s in the US, it was pretty much ignored.

**John Barkhausen:** All right, well, thanks so much for sharing your knowledge with us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.

**John Barkhausen:** Thanks a lot, Ray. Bye.
