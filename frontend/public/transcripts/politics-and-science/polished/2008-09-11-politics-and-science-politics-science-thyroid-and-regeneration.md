## Introduction: Brain Fat Regeneration

**John Barkhausen:** Welcome again to Politics and Science. Last week we were talking about oxidative metabolism and glycolysis—creating lactic acid from glucose. We were discussing this in the context of what it is to be a healthy person: having enough energy to get your tasks done, but also enough to regenerate the damage that inevitably happens to everybody as they go through daily life. You said something last week which I thought was interesting, that we regenerate 25 to 30% of the fats in our brains every night.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It might even be more than that. If you think about taking a phospholipid apart into its components and then rebuilding more phospholipids so that a chain will exist as a unit but be rebuilt into a bigger structure, that kind of turnover probably is more than 20 or 30% during the night. You can see 25% of that kind of turnover in less than an hour in some animal studies.

But if you look at the actual oxidation and renewal of particular fats—so that a fat is broken down into carbon dioxide, for example, and then new fats come in from the bloodstream—that's more like 5% per day. If you look at just arachidonic acid, for example, which makes up a considerable amount of the fat in the brain, that changes and is renewed by the bloodstream about 5% per day.

**John Barkhausen:** Why are we regenerating fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain is metabolically very active. When you stress a rat, the turnover in the brain is even faster than at rest. The brain is adapting for the whole organism and thinking up new ways to handle the environment. Whether you put a rat in a tumbling drum to stress it or just have it go through the eight or ten hours of darkness during the night, they are both stressful. The brain is trying to deal with the stress and make innovations or adjustments that help the body to cope with the next day's tasks.

**John Barkhausen:** So the original fats are being burned, or are they just getting oxidized?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A small amount, like 5% or so, are actually being oxidized. A larger amount, maybe 30 or 60%, is being reshuffled from one molecule to another. There are many types of phospholipids and other fats in the brain, and the subunits can change around so that the functions of the nerve cells are adjusted as the type of phospholipid changes.

## Energy Requirements and Sleep

**John Barkhausen:** Obviously, you need enough energy to be doing that at night. If you don't have the energy to reproduce parts of yourself that are getting worn out or need to be adapted, what happens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain synthesizes and stores glycogen, similar to muscles and the liver. With aging or stress, the glycogen is depleted, and it takes deep sleep to regenerate the glycogen. The glycogen seems to be essential. Even if you have circulating glucose, the glycogen is used for those stress-adaptive processes. Having all of your biochemical machinery available—thyroid, vitamins, minerals, and so on—is necessary, but then deep sleep is needed to restore the glycogen so that you can meet the next stresses.

**John Barkhausen:** You've mentioned before that some foods are particularly unhealthy to your thyroid, which sounds like the key mechanism for keeping your metabolism up so that you have the energy available to use.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You want to avoid the specific antithyroid compounds. The goitrogens that you find in a lot of vegetables, grains, and nuts are antithyroid. The polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) are antithyroid. Tryptophan and cysteine, which you find in muscle meats at a very high concentration, are also antithyroid.

## Thyroid Function and Hormonal Interactions

**John Barkhausen:** I didn't properly introduce you. We are talking to Dr. Raymond Peat, an endocrinologist, physiologist, and science historian. As an endocrinologist, you have extensive knowledge about hormones, and the function of the thyroid gland is a key part of that. Could you explain the function of the thyroid a little bit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People think of the thyroid as being regulated by the pituitary hormone TSH. That is a major activator, but it's responsive to practically everything in the internal environment. If your estrogen is high, the enzymes in the gland become less responsive, and the gland accumulates rather than secreting hormone. Progesterone facilitates the enzymes that are needed to secrete the hormone. Polyunsaturated fats inhibit those same enzymes.

If your body is experiencing a deficiency, your pituitary will increase the TSH—Thyroid Stimulating Hormone—to try to get the gland to compensate. If you have a lot of estrogen and polyunsaturated fats circulating, the gland will enlarge under the stimulation of the pituitary, but without secreting very efficiently.

During puberty and pregnancy, it's very common for women to have an enlarged thyroid because of the estrogen inhibiting the release of the hormone. Then, with a change of circumstances or diet, or having the baby when the estrogen goes down, sometimes there will be an episode of hyperthyroid function as that stored hormone is released. That will often scare the patient's doctor if they see their pulse running at 120 to 125 beats per minute at rest, and their hands being pink, warm, and sweaty. That's classical hyperthyroidism.

A lot of doctors will kill your thyroid with radioactive iodine or cut it out when they see symptoms like that. But it's usually just a natural adaptive process in which the enlarged gland is returning to normal size. It takes a few weeks to safely unload that amount of stored colloid thyroglobulin. Some people have told me that they never felt better in their lives than when they were in their month or two of hyperthyroidism. Unfortunately, that's the opportunity for surgeons and radiologists to destroy the thyroid.

## T3 vs. T4: The Active Hormone

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s, it was discovered that one molecule called T3, triiodothyronine, is the active promoter of respiration. But it took decades for that information to circulate through the American medical community. The Japanese, Israelis, and Russians were the first ones to really assimilate that information.

Since estrogen inhibits the activity of the thyroid, women are about five or ten times as likely to have thyroid problems as men. But when one form of synthetic thyroid, T4, which isn't the active respiration promoter, was created chemically and became a product, it was tested on 25-year-old male medical students in good health. It was found to act just like the desiccated thyroid glands that had been used at that time for 50 years.

The marketers began selling it to females without really testing it on females, because it worked on young men. But in fact, it very often interferes because the pituitary and brain will respond to it and shut off the thyroid stimulating hormone. It's good at turning off a woman's thyroid gland without necessarily being converted in the liver into the active form.

An experimenter in the 1960s who hadn't assimilated the knowledge of the two hormones—which normally exist in a ratio of three or four to one—sliced up pieces of muscle, kidney, liver, heart, and brain, and then added what he called the thyroid hormone thyroxine, or T4, to the solution. He found that it suppressed oxidative metabolism in the heart, muscle, and brain. The liver was the only gland that was strongly responsive to increasing its respiration rate in proportion to the amount of added thyroxine.

He said he had demonstrated that respiration isn't the important thing done by the thyroid hormone, because how could it be important if the thyroid hormone suppresses the metabolism of the brain and the heart? But in fact, the liver is the source of about 70% of the active thyroid hormone that circulates in the bloodstream. The thyroid gland secretes a little bit, 25 or 30% of the active hormone, but the liver, as it senses the need for energy in the body, converts T4 to T3. The brain doesn't have much of that capacity for activating the hormone. When the T4 increases beyond a certain small amount, it displaces the active hormone and suppresses brain metabolism.

I've seen that happen in numerous women. The first time I heard about it was at the University of Oregon Medical School Hospital in Portland. A woman who had been on one grain of thyroxine for some time was getting worse. They raised her dose to two grains, and every six months or so, she would be worse, so they would increase it. They finally reached the level of the equivalent of five grains—500 micrograms of Synthroid, I think. At that point, she went into a myxedema coma, in which the skin and other tissues puff up with a gelatinous edema material. She was deeply comatose. Luckily, some doctor knew about T3 being the active hormone and gave her intravenous T3, and immediately she came out of the coma.

I've seen that happen to lower degrees in women who would lose their memory or concentration or get strange neurological symptoms when they were taking pure T4. But if they would take a balanced product like natural desiccated thyroid, their symptoms would disappear.

## Estrogen and the Liver

**John Barkhausen:** How does estrogen become a problem in pregnancy? I thought that's when progesterone was high in the cycle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person is low in thyroid going into the pregnancy, or if they don't eat enough protein and certain vitamins so that the liver can function, problems arise. In experiments, if you put a source of estrogen where it goes directly to the liver and measure the amount coming out, in a healthy person, 100% goes in and 0% comes out, meaning the liver totally inactivated the estrogen.

But if it doesn't have enough protein or certain vitamins, the liver can't inactivate estrogen. So 100% goes in and maybe 99% still comes out. The estrogen is allowed to reach very high levels. The thyroid would activate the liver metabolism and restore its ability to destroy estrogen, but it becomes a vicious cycle. If your thyroid is a little low, the liver lets estrogen accumulate to a very high level, and that makes your thyroid go lower by blocking the gland itself. Since thyroid is needed to synthesize progesterone—converting cholesterol into progesterone—what happens in that situation is that your cholesterol rises and your progesterone becomes very low.

## Cholesterol: A Symptom, Not the Cause

**John Barkhausen:** That brings us to another common issue: high cholesterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1936, papers were published showing that if you measure the cholesterol at the time a person's thyroid gland is removed surgically, there is a steady, sharp increase in blood cholesterol over the next few weeks. When you put them on a thyroid supplement, the cholesterol returns to normal. If you chart the metabolic rate—oxygen consumption of the whole organism—it's a mirror image of the cholesterol. The metabolic rate falls as the cholesterol rises under the hypothyroid circumstance.

I've seen a couple of people who were in a hurry to get their cholesterol down hundreds of points. One had 400 milligrams percent, the other 500 and something. They wanted to have a good physical exam. They took the active T3 hormone in physiological amounts, roughly 5 micrograms per hour, and in a week they had restored their cholesterol to the normal range of around 200 milligrams percent.

**John Barkhausen:** Is it just that with a lower metabolism, you are not converting the cholesterol into the other steroids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some cholesterol is converted to form bile acids, steroids that help to emulsify fats in the intestine. But the formation of DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone uses a massive amount of the circulating cholesterol. For example, an experimenter put the bloodstream into an isolated ovary and then measured the substances in the blood coming out. The amount of progesterone coming out corresponded directly to the amount of cholesterol going in. If your cholesterol level was lowered, the progesterone produced by the ovary was lowered.

**John Barkhausen:** So when they're worried about the cholesterol, it sounds like the cholesterol is just a sign that your metabolism isn't functioning well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And if you artificially lower the cholesterol, you tend to lower the adaptive hormones, especially progesterone. The early studies, I think the first big one was done in Hungary, showed that lowering cholesterol tremendously increased cancer mortality, total mortality, and increased the death rate from accidents, homicide, and even heart disease and strokes.

**John Barkhausen:** Let me just interrupt to clarify that you're talking about lowering cholesterol artificially through statins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like the cholesterol itself is protective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since about 1920, they showed that just injecting pure cholesterol is protective against all the types of toxins they tested: bacterial toxins, mercury, plant toxins, and so on. It protects red blood cells from being broken down by mercury and enzyma toxins, spider and snake poisons.

**John Barkhausen:** And yet there is evidence that a high cholesterol rate is associated with disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's really just because you don't get a high excess cholesterol in the blood without being hypothyroid. You can correlate high cholesterol with things such as poor learning ability, but in experiments, if you inject cholesterol right into the brain, it improves learning ability and nerve function. It's the low thyroid, which is responsible for the high cholesterol, that accounts for the disease they associate with the high cholesterol.

## Cortisol and Stress

**John Barkhausen:** So when they say strokes are caused by high cholesterol, it's actually that you're just hypothyroid and your metabolism isn't functioning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And when you can't make the protective adaptive steroids such as progesterone and DHEA out of the cholesterol, your body does its next best adaptive procedure, which is to increase the cortisol. The chronic elevation of cortisol, which is associated with high cholesterol and low thyroid, is one of the toxic effects you see in people with high cholesterol. The chronic exposure to excess cortisol weakens blood vessels and promotes bleeding, but it also can promote clotting, osteoporosis, and various tissue degenerative processes.

**John Barkhausen:** But cortisol also has a positive purpose, doesn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It protects you. If you don't have enough pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone, you need cortisol to handle stress. But the way it handles stress is to depress inflammation. It does it at the expense of tissues such as your thymus gland, muscle, skin, and liver, converting protein to fuel to use for energy to combat the stress. It's spending your organism rapidly to get you through a crisis situation.

**John Barkhausen:** It's an emergency adaptation. That sounds like it makes you even more hypothyroid because you've explained before that when you start digesting your own muscle, that produces more antithyroid chemicals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably. The cortisol directly signals the liver. In vitro experiments indicate that cortisol blocks the enzymes that convert thyroxine into the active T3 hormone. So it's doing many related things: increasing the circulating cysteine and tryptophan to suppress the gland itself and changing several levels of physiology.

## Historical Diagnosis of Hypothyroidism

**John Barkhausen:** You've said before that you think they've changed the way they judge people's thyroid functions. In the 1930s, what percentage of people did they think were hypothyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40%, I think, by the end of the 30s.

**John Barkhausen:** That's a huge number. How did they decide what was normal and what wasn't?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They were measuring the ability to extract oxygen and burn calories. They saw that the lower a person's oxidative metabolism was, the more symptoms they had. They found that giving desiccated thyroid to increase their oxygen consumption alleviated the symptoms.

They had a large list of diagnostic symptoms: having yellow palms of the hands and soles of the feet from accumulated carotene; infertility, which they found was associated with red spots in the ovaries (the corpus luteum means "yellow body," but in hypothyroid people it was found to be a red body because it contains so much carotene). The carotene was blocking the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone because vitamin A is needed. Low thyroid people accumulate the carotene because they aren't using the vitamin A fast enough, and then they can't convert cholesterol to progesterone and become infertile.

Vitamin A is needed to antagonize estrogen in probably all cells, including the skin. So you could just look at a person's palms and very often diagnose hypothyroidism. Other signs included falling hair, thinning or thickening skin, sweating excessively or not at all. If a person had been chronically hypothyroid, their growth was usually either deficient or excessive. People who hadn't reached an average height were found to grow to a normal height when they took thyroid, and people with an excess of growth hormone were found to lower their symptoms of acromegaly if they took a thyroid supplement.

**John Barkhausen:** How would they explain that we went from 40% of the population being hypothyroid to the much lower level considered now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When they did that experiment on medical students and showed that the synthetic hormone supposedly worked just like the real stuff, that went with an advertising campaign. When I was in junior high and high school, all the fat kids were reciting what they had heard from their doctor: that they were just gluttonous and lazy and didn't have a hormone problem.

A blood test was circulated at that same time that measured Protein Bound Iodine (PBI). That test showed that 95% of the population were normal; only 5% had a low protein bound iodine content. Even though at least 40% of the people would have benefited according to the pre-war diagnostic methods, if they got anything, it was likely to be the inactive thyroxine rather than the real active hormone. Since people didn't benefit, that confirmed the idea that 95% of the people were not hypothyroid.

About 20 years later, the PBI test was found to have essentially nothing to do with thyroid function. But what it had accomplished was to teach doctors that only 5% at most would need a thyroid supplement. Over the years, new blood tests came out that actually measured the various thyroid substances, but they kept the doctrine that 95% of the people were not hypothyroid. Their "normal" definition made the new tests irrelevant.

**John Barkhausen:** So they adopted that foregone conclusion that a certain percentage were normal and based everything on that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the problems with the work up to the 1940s with thyroid was that everything from cancer and heart disease to dry skin and falling hair were known to be caused by hypothyroidism. That sort of ruined the medical business if you could cure practically everything with a thyroid supplement. So they said the belief in a panacea is irrational; we have to be scientific, and each disease is a separate thing that we have to study and treat with a specific remedy.

I just happened to run across an article published by a big medical publishing company, and the subtitle was something about "Panacea for the Next Millennium: Estrogen Receptor Modifier." If the industry supports a panacea, you can talk about it. But the fact that thyroid supplements had functioned as the equivalent of a panacea was used as propaganda against "irrational quacks" who wanted to cure everything with one pill.

## Cell Regeneration vs. Reductionism

**John Barkhausen:** If your thyroid isn't functioning, what happens to your cells when you don't have the energy to regenerate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a cell is injured, that accelerates renewal and healing. One of the signals for starting accelerated renewal is the fact that the damaged cell doesn't respire properly and doesn't use its thyroid environment to good effect. It shifts over to the injury metabolism of glycolysis, producing lactic acid. Lactic acid stimulates the growth and invasion of blood vessels, the acceleration of cell division, and secretion of connective tissue collagen.

If the whole body doesn't have enough thyroid and other supportive hormones, the injury can develop into a tumor. But normally, if your thyroid is functioning properly, instead of having those locally accelerated regenerative processes, the whole body is renewing itself in a process of "tissue streaming" or "organ streaming."

Think of the cells as a fountain coming out of one part of the organ, growing and functioning, and then disappearing in another part. In the cornea of the eye, they've applied a dye and found that the cells literally stream over a period of days from the edge of the cornea up onto the cornea. In the liver, adrenal glands, skin, and intestine, people have demonstrated this constant renewal—streaming or flowing of new cells into the tissue and the disappearance of old cells.

Every tissue is undergoing that kind of renewal from stem cells. But even though the research was done—Alexis Carrel at Rockefeller Institute in the early years of the century, and then Polezhaev, a Russian researcher in the 40s and 50s, demonstrated regeneration even in the brain—that violated one of the main medical biological doctrines. The establishment was creating a particular business model of medicine that took over completely in the late 1940s. The idea of organ regeneration as a normal biological process was stamped out.

People thought of aging as a simple natural process in which each cell had its finite lifespan, and when that was used up, the organism would die. It's really the Leibniz monad doctrine that nothing interacts: every individual cell has its internal model of the universe running like a clock. That was the model that took over medicine after the Second World War.

**John Barkhausen:** You mentioned Hayflick last week as the person who did the experiment that ended up convincing most of science that you can't regenerate, only to a certain limit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fact that he worked at a very influential laboratory that sold biological material, cell cultures, and rats to laboratories all over the country helped to give him a reputation. People just assumed that an idiot wouldn't be working for a big company like that. For 30 years I thought he was just a very remarkably stupid person, but then I saw he had financial motives that might save his mental reputation.

**John Barkhausen:** It makes me wonder where the peer review process was when he came up with those results.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's pretty much where it always has been. I've been following the estrogen receptor doctrine for many years. The promoter of that, Elwood Jensen, was working in chemical warfare. He even titled one of his articles "From Chemical Warfare to Breast Cancer Treatment." In making that transition, he created the idea of the estrogen receptor.

Biologists had been demonstrating how estrogen is metabolized and integrated in cell physiology in meaningful ways relating to oxidation and reduction. But Jensen got funding and support from the Atomic Energy Commission because of his military connection. It was extremely expensive to create a molecule with radioactive isotopes, but the AEC provided the stuff. On the basis of his experiment, he claimed that estrogen is not oxidized in the tissue and only acts through this protein called the estrogen receptor.

Because of the prestige of his funding, he shaped the whole biological culture. The enzymologists that he said were ignorant, old-fashioned fools kept on working, and now everyone knows that they were right—estrogen is reduced and oxidized. But the culture served its purpose and created the whole industry of estrogen receptor selective modifiers.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think there's such a thing as a receptor as a place where things plug in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The whole cell is a receptor. It's like a perceptual process because the state of the cell governs what the response is going to be. The cell is in charge. The receptor idea is a perfect model of reductionist biology that really has no sound scientific basis.

## Politics in Science

**John Barkhausen:** I just got a book out of the library called *The Secret History of the War on Cancer* by Devra Davis. She talks about working at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and how she had a theory that a lot of cancer was caused by environmental things. Her boss, Frank Press, told her, "It had better be a really, really good book... because you won't be able to work here after you write it."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wouldn't be surprised if the NSA was involved too. Following up Elwood Jensen's Atomic Energy Commission connections and germ warfare, I found that the estrogen receptor gene people have been involved in military-financed sterilization and cancer studies continuing through the University of Chicago and currently at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.

**John Barkhausen:** She also mentions that some of the first modern studies on workplace causes of cancer were carried out by scientists around 1936, including many who worked in Nazi Germany. She says in 1945, an army captain traveled throughout Germany gathering information on chemical and hormonal hazards for the US Army, but sixty years later, these files remain unpublished.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of American financing has gone into how to use that information as chemical-biological warfare. I think national security is the reason it has never benefited the public. It has extended into the virus theory and works against environmental causation of cancer. It's hard to separate ignorant results from deliberate propaganda results.
