## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** My guest today on Politics and Science is Raymond Peat, endocrinologist and physiologist from Eugene, Oregon. Ray, how are you today?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good.

**John Barkhausen:** Ray, maybe you should give your resume, because obviously you can do it better than I.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, well, I'm not sure I can. I was a humanities person first. While I was studying painting and literature, I was interested in science and read widely in libraries and encyclopedias. My first teaching job, while I was studying linguistics at Ohio State, was in a little college where I got assigned to teach biology. Because I had been reading in it for so long, the experience of teaching it was fun.

I taught art and English for a few years after that, but finally decided to go back to graduate school in 1968 to study biology in a university. My first courses in the sciences didn't impress me that I would be able to learn much in a university. It was the same in English, philosophy, and psychology. I basically felt that the institutions were anti-educational—that their purpose was to prepare people to conform, to get a job, and go along with the system. By the time I finally decided to be a biologist, I had learned how to be quiet enough that I could get through the degree program.

The graduate school experience—I think most people having done it recognize that it's an exercise in conformism rather than anything very special about learning.

**John Barkhausen:** You mean that they're looking for certain behavioral patterns from their students?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In the 60s, psychologists at Oregon State University did a study of academic success and how students had scored on the Miller Analogies Test. It is somewhat a test of cultural knowledge—you have to know the language—but it's partly a study of mental flexibility and ability to reason about new problems. She found that the students who scored average on the Miller Analogies Test were straight-A, very successful students in graduate school. The ones who deviated from the average, either up or down, were the less successful in graduate school. This means that having an average ability and conforming really is the way to be an outstanding graduate student.

**John Barkhausen:** And after you were a graduate student, you got your Ph.D. in 1972?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1972. I actually took more courses in biochemistry than in biology, but the degree was in biology.

**John Barkhausen:** Since then you've taught at a number of universities, I believe.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I taught some courses at the University of Oregon, but also in Mexico, at the University of Veracruz and the State University of Mexico.

## Publishing and Scientific Politics

**John Barkhausen:** You write extensively in a newsletter called Ray Peat's Newsletter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been doing that since 1981. Having had essentially all of my research rejected by the journals, I decided just to go ahead and publish my own things and not have to deal with editors. I had sent some very simple critical things as letters to editors of, for example, *Science* magazine, pointing out that they were drawing racist conclusions from evidence that had absolutely nothing to do with their conclusions. Even a little two-sentence criticism like that was rejected as being more extreme than the authors of the study I was commenting on. I considered science to be so political that I decided to publish my own books and newsletters.

**John Barkhausen:** I think some of your writings prompted me to name the show *Politics and Science* because the two seem very closely interwoven. In fact, they seem unable to escape from each other, to the detriment of science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In the 50s, when I first started teaching biology, my course was officially named "Biology Introduction for Physics Majors." Since the students were planning to major in physics, I thought the biological work should relate to their interests. I thought information technology—how the organism was interpreted as information—and radiation biology were things that would be important to physics majors.

When the students got interested in reading what the government was saying about the safety of radioactive fallout, that caused great turmoil in the trustees of the university. They invited a professor from the University of Illinois to apply for my job. When he arrived, his invited speech was on radiation biology. He started his lecture looking at his wrist and saying, "Notice I'm not wearing a wristwatch." He said, "I realized how much radiation was being emitted from the dial and threw my watch away in a radioactive disposal." He not only didn't get the job he applied for, but he got fired from the University of Illinois.

**John Barkhausen:** I wonder how many they had to go through before they found a proper replacement for you. It sounds like you're not alone out there. I know at one point you recommended a book called *Cold War in Biology*, which certainly speaks to the politics that go along with the science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a good introduction to the politics of genetics in a broader sense—not just the racist genetics that they were teaching in American universities, but the whole history way back to the 19th century.

## The History of Fats and Oils

**John Barkhausen:** I was hoping today that we'd talk about fats, seeing that's a subject that's in the news all the time. The government always makes recommendations for what kind of fats you should be eating, and they seem to change their minds about every five years. I remember when I was growing up, they told you to avoid greasy fried foods. Wesson oil was the standard in the 50s. Then at some point, they told you that those vegetable oils were good for you and that the thing to avoid was butter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Wesson oil was cottonseed oil.

**John Barkhausen:** Oh, was it? I always thought that was corn.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, maybe it was at some time, but in the 50s when I investigated it, it was cottonseed oil. That has a long history. Mark Twain, in one of his books, told about hearing a conversation in the 1860s where people were on his boat talking about how they were going to make Americans eat cottonseed oil instead of butter.

**John Barkhausen:** That's right. Talk about a fat conspiracy. I think I read that they were taking olive oil from Italy and then cutting it ten-to-one with cottonseed oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 10 years ago, the FDA did a survey of all the imported olive oil sold in the US and reported that 70% of it was adulterated still.

**John Barkhausen:** That's not too encouraging. Maybe we could start with a bit of the history of fat consumption—what's traditionally been eaten by humans and how that's evolved.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 19th century, my relatives were still preferring fat meat to lean meat, and the taste of it seemed to be an important guide. People really didn't trim the fat from their meat because it tasted good. It was fairly isolated areas where they used exotic oils like extracted oils. Usually, they just ate oily fruits, the coconut itself, avocados, sunflower seeds, and fat poultry, beef, and pigs.

Around the 18th or 19th century was when the industrial market started promoting cod liver oil and some of the seed oils. But even fish oil was primarily used for varnish and lamps right up until the time of petroleum. When petroleum became so cheap, the plant and fish oils became too expensive, and they went looking for new markets.

Coconut oil is easy to get out with primitive technology. The oriental countries where it was grown would boil the semi-dried coconut meat and float off the oil. It was being used to feed chickens and pigs in the United States and to make Oreo cookies, for example, just because of its cheapness and the fact that it didn't get rancid.

But the agricultural industry in the 40s experimented and found that even though coconut oil was cheap, it stimulated the animals' appetites and metabolic rates, causing them to eat more food and gain less weight. One reaction was to use chemical poisons to slow their metabolic rate by poisoning the thyroid glands. Another discovery was that if they used fish oil, linseed oil, or cottonseed oil—any of the unsaturated fats—they could slow the metabolic rate and make them put on fat more cheaply. So the seed oil industry now had a fairly good market in feeding pigs.

Around 1950, the petroleum chemists found a new use for petroleum other than fuel: making paints and plastics. Where fish oil and linseed oil had been the major basis for making paints and varnishes, now those markets were lost. The linseed oil industry looked for new ways to sell their products. That was when the idea of oil as an "essential nutrient" started being promoted.

The study that has been cited for many decades was performed in connection with the lard industry, claiming that unsaturated fats were essential nutrients. The linseed oil industry, because their product is rich in unsaturated fats, picked up that isolated bit of research. They ignored the studies which previously had demonstrated that animals thrived on a diet completely lacking the unsaturated fats—or any fats, in fact. But that study was so promoted by the oil industry that it created the idea that the unsaturated fats are essential nutrients.

## Essential Fatty Acids and Metabolism

**John Barkhausen:** So even though they claim they're essential, you're saying there was an experiment where animals thrived without them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Starting about 1910 through the 1920s, there were several experiments in which animals were actually healthier when they didn't get any of the fats. A German study published in 1927 showed that as the animals received less fat in their diet, the incidence of cancer decreased. The cancer rate was directly proportional to the amount of fat in the diet. That study, and others that showed increased longevity, were ignored in the research that claimed the essentiality of the unsaturated fats.

**John Barkhausen:** You hear from so many people that they're essential.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The University of Texas had a famous nutrition lab under Roger Williams. In his lab in the 1940s, the researchers said the rat disease supposedly caused by a deficiency of essential fatty acids looked exactly like their vitamin B6 deficiency disease.

Only one or two of the B vitamins were known at the time the original research was done. But in the 40s, they had identified the deficiency disease specifically caused by a vitamin B6 deficiency. So they reproduced the diet fed in the 1929 research to their animals but gave them vitamin B6. It completely cured the "essential fatty acid deficiency" without any essential fatty acids.

The interpretation of why the fat-free or low-fat diet caused those symptoms was that the essential fatty acids suppress the metabolic rate, as the pig farmers demonstrated. When your metabolism is suppressed, you don't eat as much food or drink as much water, so your nutritional requirements are depressed. But if you stimulate their metabolism by *not* giving them the suppressive unsaturated fatty acids, you will reveal a vitamin deficiency. As your metabolic rate increases, you eat more protein, and to process that protein, you use up your vitamin B6 faster.

**John Barkhausen:** So do you think people are blaming symptoms caused by vitamin B6 deficiency on the lack of these EFAs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been a few other isolated studies through the 50s and 60s. Usually, one patient would get eczema, and that would get published as proof that the essential fatty acids deficiency disease existed. But at that time, when they were giving a fat-free diet, they were often giving intravenous feeding. Their concept of complete intravenous nutrition until well into the 1970s was radically deficient in several of the essential known nutrients. Zinc, for example, wasn't included. Biotin deficiency can produce some of the related symptoms. When your metabolic rate is high and you metabolize more protein, zinc, biotin, and B6 are among the first deficiencies to show up.

**John Barkhausen:** So the control group that wasn't being given the "essential fatty acids" wasn't getting any minerals and vitamins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Even hospitals were keeping babies on this intravenous feeding. Even though the nutrition journals knew what the essential nutrients such as zinc were, hospitals refused to include them because doctors weren't doing it.

**John Barkhausen:** It's a little confusing because people have a symptom, say eczema, and a naturopath tells them to eat flax oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you suppress your metabolism, you can get under the metabolic rate at which you need a certain amount of nutrition. So you can "cure" a vitamin B6, biotin, or zinc deficiency sometimes just by taking a toxic thing that suppresses your metabolism.

**John Barkhausen:** So you're saying in the long run, that has other bad effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same applies to fish oil to suppress inflammation. Even people who were advocating its use published reports showing radical suppression of immunity by eating a moderate amount of fish oil. David Horrobin, for example, went on advocating polyunsaturated fats therapeutically, even though he published evidence showing decisive suppression of the immune system. You can get away with suppressing inflammation for six months or a year, maybe a couple of years, just by knocking out your immune system. But it's not good in the long run.

## Fish Oil and Depression

**John Barkhausen:** On the fish oil front, you hear that some people take fish oil to fight depression. What's your take on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've read all of the publications on it. Some of them say it makes depression worse; some say it doesn't do anything.

**John Barkhausen:** These are the studies you've seen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you select the few that say it helped a certain group, you can truthfully report that this group improved, while someone else reports that their group got worse on fish oil. If there's a bias in the journal regarding who gets published, then you don't actually see the empirical data that existed in the world.

**John Barkhausen:** I read a quote you used from a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell. It was something to the effect that you can't really tell the truth of the studies unless you know all the studies that they rejected.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a probability at the 5% level, but you rejected 10, 20, or 100 publications with negative results, you're biasing statistics.

## Canola, Heart Health, and Thyroid

**John Barkhausen:** I don't think we've covered all the different fats. People probably want to know what is bad and what is good. Is canola as bad as cottonseed oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1960s, there was a lot of concern that there was a special toxic fat in mustard oil or rapeseed oil. They bred a variety that didn't have that particular fatty acid, and that became canola. But meanwhile, researchers were experimenting. They showed that giving rapeseed oil would typically cause spots of tissue in the heart to die. Mainstream medicine said that was because of the toxic fatty acid that the breeders were eliminating.

However, Hans Selye gave purified linoleic acid—a major component of rapeseed oil—and showed that *that* was the actual toxic agent to the heart, not the so-called special toxic fatty acid. It was the "essential fatty acid" itself killing heart cells. He added chocolate fat, cocoa butter, to the diet, and that protected the heart. In spite of the same amount of linoleic acid in the diet, adding stearic acid in the cocoa butter was protective.

**John Barkhausen:** I see.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the ratio that is important. One of the early rat studies that got me interested in coconut oil involved putting 15 different groups of rats on different diets. One series was pure coconut oil (high, low, and medium fat). Another was pure unsaturated corn oil (high, medium, and low). They kept them on that diet throughout their lifespan.

At the end of the normal lifespan, the fat rats were the ones on an unsaturated fat diet. The lean rats were the ones on the coconut, saturated fat diet. The quantity of fat they ate didn't make any significant difference; it was the ratio. The degree of unsaturation corresponded to the degree of obesity.

A series of French publications in the 1980s really defined what the pig farmers had demonstrated practically. The French showed biochemically how it works. They showed that increasing the number of unsaturations—two double bonds was worse than monounsaturated, and three double bonds was worse than two. The worst was the multiply unsaturated.

Every component of the thyroid system that they examined—from the secretion of the hormone from the thyroid gland, its transport on proteins through the blood, and the cell's response to it—was selectively inhibited in proportion to the unsaturation of the oil that the animal was getting. It very neatly explained what the pig farmers found out economically: by slowing down the metabolism of the pig, it would gain weight with the unsaturated fat diet.

**John Barkhausen:** This probably deserves a whole show, but perhaps you could summarize what the thyroid does for the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The real thyroid hormone, the active part of it, wasn't discovered until the 1950s, but the function of the thyroid was studied since the mid-to-late 19th century. It was known to activate all of the organs of the body to respire, consume more oxygen, and perform more perfectly. A deficiency of thyroid was very early learned to cause mental retardation, underdevelopment of the brain, idiocy, and infertility. In some areas of the world, cretins were good employees because they were passive and stupid and didn't reproduce, so the medical establishments in those areas didn't want to cure it.

Broda Barnes in the 1930s did studies on rabbits and in Europeans and showed that the "goiter belts" were highly susceptible to heart disease at a very young age. In their 30s, they started having atherosclerosis and heart attacks. When iodine was introduced to those regions, the heart disease mortality decreased considerably. But those areas also had a very high cancer rate, especially breast cancer. As recently as the 1980s, cancer biologists in Mexico were reporting that the iodine deficiency regions in the mountains around Mexico City still had a very high rate of tuberculosis, heart disease, and breast cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** Excuse me, but iodine deficiency slows your thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In those regions, iodine deficiency was the thing that could be remedied. But in many areas, the diet interacts with limited iodine. It isn't just an iodine deficiency, but eating vegetables that interrupt the formation of thyroid hormone. The cabbage family and the unsaturated fats are the two most famous causes of interrupting the formation of the thyroid hormone.

**John Barkhausen:** And people with low thyroid get goiters, which are big protrusions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pituitary gland produces Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) that compensates when your thyroid is being blocked. Naturally, estrogen inhibits the thyroid release too. The body is designed so that if estrogen is inhibiting the gland, TSH increases to overcome that block and activates the thyroid to work harder. If you keep your estrogen or goitrogen high, the TSH works harder and harder, and the gland gets bigger and bigger until sometimes it gets to be as big as a cantaloupe.

Women at puberty and during pregnancy often get a fullness in the neck. That typically causes women to have creases in the skin of their neck. Most women, but almost no men, have a defining crease right above their collarbone and just above their Adam's apple.

**John Barkhausen:** And that defined crease is from a low thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because at puberty, the thyroid gland naturally enlarges to overcome the effect of estrogen, and that makes a fullness so that the bending of the neck causes those creases to outline the puffy area where the gland is.

## Ubiquity of Unsaturated Fats

**John Barkhausen:** Going back to the essential fatty acids, you've said that one of the reasons it's ridiculous to call them essential is that they're ubiquitous. They're in everything, so how could we have a deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a question of marketing. They are in every organism, even tropical organisms. Coconuts have about 1% to 2% of those fats. Ruminants—sheep, cows, and deer—have an organ to grow bacteria which detoxify those plant fats. But still, 1% or 2% of the fats get through the detox system of the rumen. So beef fat and lamb fat still have unavoidably about 2% of those unsaturated vegetable oils. Even if you ate nothing but beef, lamb, and coconut, you'd still have more than anyone ever claimed was required. So by the most extreme ideas of essentiality, it's impossible to have a deficiency unless you eat a laboratory-prepared diet.

But the marketing departments of the linseed oil and Wesson oil companies convinced people that since it's essential in a trace amount, it must be much better in a very large amount. Several more recent research studies have demonstrated that as you increase the unsaturated fats in the diet, the cancer incidence goes up more or less in proportion to the amount. When you extrapolate it to zero, the cancer incidence approaches zero.

**John Barkhausen:** When you say extrapolate to zero, you mean no unsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhausen:** And fish oil is also very unsaturated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few years ago, the FDA warned that the total shouldn't exceed 3 grams of DHA and EPA. But they more recently have dropped that and have begun promoting it without the warning. But it definitely becomes toxic, as the immune suppression studies demonstrated.

The odd thing about fish oil is that it's so unstable. The reason it was a good varnish is that it oxidizes almost instantly, even at room temperature. In your body, it's mostly oxidized before it reaches your bloodstream. It has to pass through your digestive system, be heated, and circulated in tiny particles exposed to oxygen. Those so-called beneficial anti-inflammatory effects are actually produced by the oxidative breakdown products of the fats. So even in the biochemistry of it, it's a toxic effect that is being sold as a benefit.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's suppressing your immune system and that's what's getting rid of some of your symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's the free radical oxidative decomposition products that are circulating in your blood system. A very small part of it reaches your tissues as the original starting DHA and EPA.

**John Barkhausen:** How much does the marketing affect the scientific research? The media seems to still be very down on saturated fats and promoting unsaturated fats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They apparently have taken over the government because I see the government has basically a promotion of fish oil on their website. The industry, just like the soy oil industry, has subsidized research on the health value of soy oil. The fish oil industry is now rich enough that they are sponsoring conferences, paying researchers to produce studies, and getting people on editorial boards of the journals. Just like the atomic energy industry controlling the research on the safety of radiation, the health effects of fats are being promoted by the industry, not by objective science.

**John Barkhausen:** Now you mentioned cancer in terms of unsaturated oils. Does that apply to fish oil as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Except that the shorter 18-carbon oils that you get from seeds fit into our enzyme systems more powerfully and so inhibit our own enzymes more powerfully. The fish oils are very long and don't directly attack our enzymes in the same way. They're unstable and spontaneously turn into these free radical and aldehyde toxins, but they are safer to our enzyme systems because their number of carbons is very different from the fats that we make or that we get from seeds.

**John Barkhausen:** And they also come with quite a few vitamins, too.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When you squeeze an oily fish, you can't help getting some vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin D, and a little E. The E is pretty much destroyed quickly by the oxidative process, but the D comes through very strongly because it's harder to oxidize. The K and A probably usually have enough activity to be of some benefit.

## Dietary Recommendations

**John Barkhausen:** We have about five minutes left. People are probably wondering, what is good to eat? Is olive oil okay? Coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coconut oil is around 10% polyunsaturated fats. If you're only going to use half a teaspoon or so for flavoring a food, or a teaspoonful every other day, that is small enough that it isn't harmful. As a minor flavoring, olive oil is fine.

But as a major part of the diet, I think butter, beef fat, lamb fat, and coconut oil are the safe ones. And cocoa butter—chocolate. Some studies have found that the longer saturated fats are very protective. They're being investigated for curing cancer and heart disease. Some of the best studies are using the long-chain saturated fats as well as ordinary butter fats for treating liver disease. Alcoholic hepatitis, for example, is being successfully treated with saturated fat. About 20 years ago, they noticed that alcoholic liver injury requires polyunsaturated fats in the diet. Some Hindus noticed that in the areas of India where they have primarily butter, alcoholics don't get liver disease at the high rate that they do in areas that get the unsaturated fats. So the animal studies finally led to human studies in Chicago in which they are finding actual cures of alcoholic liver disease just with a good diet plus the saturated fats.

**John Barkhausen:** The unsaturated oils are in everything now. You can't buy a potato chip that isn't cooked in canola oil. If you go out to dinner, is there anything you can do to protect yourself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 15 years ago there was this big campaign to get coconut oil off the market. In recent years it is coming back. I think if people just nag the cooks in restaurants and buyers in grocery stores, they can change things. It's changing back in the last few years to people demanding that they get real butter and other saturated fats.

**John Barkhausen:** Finally, I think most people are worried about getting fat when you say butter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The animal studies, from the industrial agriculture level all the way down to lab studies, show that the polyunsaturateds are extremely fattening in proportion to their role in the diet. The proportion to the saturated fats is more important than the actual quantity of fats. I noticed in Finland, where dairy foods are very common—probably the most common food—just going across the border from Russia to Finland, you go from a starch-eating, vegetable-based diet where everyone's fat, over to a lean, healthy population where they eat lots of butterfat. In general, Americans who eat milk and milk products are lean. It's partly the calcium and vitamin D, but also the butterfat itself is helpful.

**John Barkhausen:** I guess that's the French paradox again. Well, Ray, we're basically out of time. Is there anything else you'd like to add?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People are concerned about skin health and appearance. An experiment with rabbits is interesting. Rabbits were put on either a corn oil diet or a coconut oil diet and shaved so the sun would hit their skin. Those on the unsaturated corn oil diet got wrinkly, sun-damaged skin. For the ones on the saturated fat diet, the sun was relatively harmless to their skin.

**John Barkhausen:** That's kind of telling, isn't it? Well Ray, thanks so much for being on today. The hour blew by.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**John Barkhausen:** Thanks, Ray. Bye.
