## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** My guest today is Dr. Raymond Peat, and I'm happy to have him back again. We're going to talk about your recent newsletter entitled "How Do You Know? Students, Patients, and Discovery." The scope of the newsletter is enormous. It ranges from discussing a unifying, self-ordering principle concerning the nature of the universe, and talks about how the same principle is reflected in our learning processes, in our culture, and in all other functional, goal-directed systems in our world.

You used the quote "One thought fills immensity" by William Blake as the motto of the newsletter. I thought that was very apt because it's such a profound subject. To bring people into this, it would be useful if you could tell us some of your personal experience as a student and then as a teacher, and how this formed your outlook toward the world.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My parents had quite a few interesting books. They had gotten some from their parents, 19th-century books like a second or third edition of Darwin's *Descent of Man*. They also had a collection of the "Little Blue Books." They were published in Kansas and were the classics in 5 and 10-cent versions. So there was quite a variety of reading material when I was a little kid, including encyclopedias.

The older *Encyclopedia Britannica* and others were pretty objective at that time on issues like Darwin versus Lamarck. They gave the research done in the early part of the 20th century in different countries. That gave me an orientation where I began preferring the non-genetic version of the adaptation of individuals to the environment. By the late 1940s, when the genetics doctrine was being imposed politically very powerfully through the US, that made me start seeing the political significance of science in general, and especially biology.

**John Barkhausen:** Can you give us some sense of time? What year were you reading the Little Blue Books?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right after I learned to read. *Alley Oop* and such, then went right to the Little Blue Books, probably 1940.

## Kropotkin, Darwin, and Political Science

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All through the 40s, my parents knew about Peter Kropotkin's political writings as well as his "mutual aid" factor of evolution. That was my first political book, Kropotkin's biological work on evolution. From that, he drew his anarchist political ideas. That fit in with the other stuff I had been reading on the true Darwin, not the pseudo-Darwinism that was promoted after the 1940s.

Neo-Darwinism really was pretty much anti-Darwin. In Darwin's introduction to the *Descent of Man*, he pointed out that his ideas were being distorted and that he didn't say that the struggle for survival and natural selection was the basic power of evolution. He named several other, more Lamarckian factors in evolution.

**John Barkhausen:** That's more in line with what Kropotkin was saying.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Kropotkin emphasized cooperation within species and even between species in symbiosis.

Although I was interested in science before I went to college, by the time I was in college, I was convinced that there was really something wrong with American and British science in particular. So I concentrated on the humanities and did my master's thesis on William Blake. That gave me a chance to spend years reading the history of philosophy and philosophy of science. When I years later finally did go back to a degree in science, I had sort of inoculated myself against being indoctrinated and forced to believe the very dogmatic ideas that make up American science.

**John Barkhausen:** What gave you the clue that it was dogmatic and not based in actuality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You hear the joke about Aristotle having counted the number of teeth in a donkey, and that being repeated for hundreds of years. The same thing happened in American chromosome study. Even though Germans were able to count and investigate the effect of chromosomes way back in the early 20th century, major American biologists didn't even believe that chromosomes had to do with heredity until the early 1920s.

Then, all the way up until 1956, American and English scientists were still saying that humans have 48 chromosomes. I had read enough in the 40s to know that people vary somewhat in their numbers, but by far the most common number of chromosomes was 46 in normal humans. Somehow, once fixed ideas are said with great authority, Americans and British just kept saying it over and over for decades.

## Teaching and Self-Correction

**John Barkhausen:** Did you have some good teachers yourself personally going through the school system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had three good teachers in the 19 years of college and university, out of about 60, I guess.

**John Barkhausen:** You write in this newsletter about teaching literature. Could you recount your experience trying to follow the school regulations and then finally giving up on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That year I was teaching two different kinds of composition. In freshman composition, the department had a list of how we had to grade papers. For each type of grammatical, spelling, or diction mistake, you would mark off so many points. The purpose was to fail about 90% of the freshmen. That was called "keeping up standards."

I saw after doing that for a few weeks that the students were writing worse and worse because they thought they tended to make mistakes when they didn't have everything under very conscious control. So they started writing like first graders. I had to read several dozen of their papers, and to save myself the suffering of reading first-grade papers, I told them that I would from then on ignore the spelling, punctuation, and the things on that list. I would grade them entirely on their ability to communicate something of interest to me.

Within just a couple of weeks, everyone was writing much better. I had my office partner, who was teaching similar classes following the rules, read some of the before and after papers. He found that when I wasn't grading for errors, the students were writing better according to his and the department's standards. They were supposedly keeping up standards while actually degrading the work output of the students. When I asked them to put their emphasis on communicating something and not think about the mechanics of it, suddenly the mechanics improved as well as the content.

**John Barkhausen:** Did you know about Carl Rogers at that point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was majoring in psychology in the 1950s and I read his *Client-Centered Therapy* sometime in the late 50s.

**John Barkhausen:** What was his influence on education?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He went from his work showing that it's the coherent personality of the therapist that makes a difference in therapy situations, not any psychiatric technique. He established that the validity of their communication with the client was the thing that made psychological therapy work. Then he extended that and began popularizing the idea of student-centered education.

**John Barkhausen:** So it was the therapist allowing the person to self-direct their own emotional recovery that was working.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It was the process of listening deeply so that the patient, in effect, began hearing what they were saying themselves by having someone understand them.

**John Barkhausen:** How was he received?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even other psychiatrists—since he showed empirically that people recovered in proportion to the coherence of the therapist's personality and that it had nothing to do with whether they were a Freudian or a behaviorist—rejected it. The doctrinaire psychologists said that isn't possible because they really believe in their theories. The medical psychiatrists were the most rejecting; they said he isn't even a psychologist, much less a psychiatrist.

## Dogma in Physics and Science

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Professors in general didn't like that approach because the point of being a professor is to demonstrate that you know it all. If a person goes into a physics class, the assumption is that the professor is going to transmit, bit by bit, his textbook into the mind of the student, as an absolute filling up of an empty space.

Back when I was teaching English and literature, I talked to a variety of physics people because one of my interests was how physics underlies biology, which underlies language and consciousness. I felt I had to have satisfaction that there was some rational physics behind it. I talked to a lot of physics professionals, and invariably, when I would ask them a question, they would quote word-for-word right out of their textbook. They simply couldn't conceive what I was asking if it was an attempt to know anything other than what is in the book.

Really, the most dogmatic people in science seem to be in physics. One of my professors, who I thought was intelligent, said that the average physics graduate student has trouble knowing whether a ball will roll up or down an inclined plane because they've been trained so abstractly.

**John Barkhausen:** That's a little discouraging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The physicists who tend towards the mathematical side dislike applied mathematics. One of the local professors, who was very famous, explained some nuclear particle interactions as being explainable by a particle coming from the *future* and meeting the nucleus at the moment the nucleus emits a particle. Just a most fundamentally confused person who thought time could run both ways at the same time.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that the influence of quantum physics on the scientific culture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the abstract way everything is taught. Even getting someone to look at the history of where the idea of quantum thinking came from is difficult. There have been books treating the German physics community at that time, showing how important idealistic philosophy was in their cultural context.

For example, take Einstein's photoelectric theory. At the time Einstein thought of the necessity to quantize light to explain why a certain frequency rather than intensity is needed to liberate electrons, he subscribed to the idea that matter is an assemblage of atomic particles, each one electrically discrete. He thought there is no electrical blurring across the substance.

When Michael Polanyi in 1915 presented a description of his work in the adsorption of gases onto solid surfaces, Einstein was one of the people at the meeting who said, "Sorry, that isn't possible. You're thinking in some kind of primitive Hungarian way. Here in Germany, we know that electrons are discreetly attached to atoms." It was that kind of thinking that was background to the quantized physics that took over the world. But Einstein was simply mistaken about how matter worked.

**John Barkhausen:** So even great minds can go astray. Did he try to call it back when he realized his error?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was about 1930 when the adsorption people started creating alternative ways to explain the experimental evidence Polanyi had demonstrated. Polanyi's evidence was vindicated, but they told a different story about how it worked. From about that time on, Einstein began saying he couldn't really accept the whole quantum approach to physical reality.

## Genetics, Evolution, and Politics

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like that's an example of how dogma gets legs of its own. We're also talking about learning and how it works best if it's self-organizing. Carl Rogers was postulating that things tend to be self-organizing and live up to their fullest potential.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's in the biological idea of what a cell and an organism is where you see the clearest demonstration of that principle. In biology, there has been a huge amount of data accumulated showing that things are open, but trying to explain them in terms of these quantized, eternal parts just doesn't work.

That's where molecular biology and the dominant theory of genetics came from: a belief in an otherworldly nature of the gene. What they were doing was agreeing with the theological rejection of evolution. Mendel was a monk who gained his own professional standing by seeming to have disproved evolution. He showed that traits are eternal even though the organisms seem to change; they're only changing their appearance, but their essential nature is timeless.

The church people liked Mendel's work, but then English biologists took it up for the same reason they hated some of the things Darwin said which agreed with Lamarck—that organisms can be changed by their experience. That has racial overtones. If you say the working-class people can radically fit their nature and become philosophers, that messes with the whole authoritarian social system. The English ruling class biologists loved the Mendelian approach because it said Darwin and Lamarck were both profoundly mistaken about how evolution works.

**John Barkhausen:** So genetics just grew out of a way to appease the church and maintain the status quo?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things in the 50s that made me think American biology was ridiculous was that they believed genes would specify everything, including the way we thought. They believed every synapse of every nerve cell was supposed to be genetically determined. Someone calculated how impossible that was when they realized how many brain cells there were. People started rethinking that. As the genetics people learned more about DNA, it turned out that the great bulk of the DNA isn't there for genetic purposes. The genes that make up a person or a yeast are a very small part of the DNA present.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like there's a prejudice among educators and therapists against the self-ordering idea that goes across all professional trades.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I happened to be teaching a linguistics course in the 60s, just about the time Noam Chomsky was coming out against the Vietnam War. I had been pointing out how there was absolutely no evidence in Chomsky's type of linguistics. He totally ignored evidence. It was absolutely idealistic doctrine saying that we have genes that specify the way we talk.

There's almost no difference between Chomsky's idealistic genetic idea of language and Konrad Lorenz's genetic explanation for all behavior, which Lorenz designed specifically for Hitler to justify racial extermination. Chomsky wouldn't like that comparison, but in fact, they're both committed to ignoring the actual evidence and believing that genes explain everything. Lorenz's motive was obviously to say that society is constituted the way it should be, except for the mongrelizing with bad genetic traits—such as liking jazz music—which should be exterminated.

**John Barkhausen:** I hear the dogmatists saying that everything is determined by genes, yet they also propose things like chaos theory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea of randomness goes way back into the 19th century. It was a sort of compromise. They said that if anything changes, it changes only randomly. When Muller started showing that he could mutate fruit flies with X-rays, the change was seen to deteriorate almost always. That was because change is random.

If you're going to have change, it can't be meaningful. You can't say that if you feed poor people they will have healthier babies who will be more intelligent, because that would say that you have a directional change being caused by the environment. The whole point of genetics is to say the environment can't change the reality of the organism.

**John Barkhausen:** You've said that Neo-Kantian philosophy has dominated US universities, arguing that our senses are limited so we can't really know the world. Does that tie into that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, our senses are determined by our genes. Even for the Chomsky point of view, our thoughts and behaviors are determined by our genes.

**John Barkhausen:** How do languages fit into how we learn?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chomsky says that we really don't learn our language in the structural sense. If we're born with it, all we do is learn some of the minor details of vocabulary and pronunciation. The Neo-Kantians, at the extreme, say that our perceptions are shaped by our genes. Many of them revive the Leibnizian idea of monads—that all of our knowledge and experience is in our genes, so we aren't really experiencing anything.

George Wald, a famous professor who investigated vision, explained that color vision is based on a difference of frequencies rather than an absolute color. By testing people who had their lenses removed from their eyes because of cataracts, he found that they could see patterns in ultraviolet light the same way bees can. That's one of the favorite examples of the Neo-Kantians: that we are determined to see the world in a certain way. But when the thick lens is removed, the ultraviolet light gets to our retina and humans *can* see it. It's just a matter of the intensity of stimulus.

Some people say that bees and birds have a genetically programmed way of thinking, so we can never really know what a bee is thinking. But people who look at animals in their natural setting see that bees and ants are solving unique, original problems that never happened before in a manner that rivals human thinking. Given a setup of instruction and arrangements in space, ants were able to learn and transmit information as competently as trained air traffic controllers.

**John Barkhausen:** I've never understood why we separated ourselves from the animals to begin with. It just seems like another form of elitism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a few decades ago, some of the most famous professors in the country were saying that there are subhumans and real humans, and that working-class people are genetically inferior. They argued that with an improved society, working-class people will all go to the bottom genetically and the talented people will all rise to the top.

**John Barkhausen:** Like *The Bell Curve* by Herrnstein and Murray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Herrnstein was a famous Harvard professor who said that we needed a proper meritocracy where there wasn't the confusion of trying to educate working-class people.

## Language, Abstraction, and Fields

**John Barkhausen:** You talked about Alfred Korzybski and Paulo Freire both pointing out the use of language and abstractions in education.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Paulo Freire had an empirical view of reality. When people realized that they could define the words of their language, it caused them to start thinking rather than simply accepting what their betters wanted to impose on them. He asked people to choose a vocabulary they wanted to investigate and to define the terms themselves.

Korzybski pretty much got stuck in the idea that there were gradients of concreteness and generality, and that truth involved getting down to the specific concrete fact. He was basically an enemy of the idea that general perceptions and concepts were just as valid as concrete naming. He wanted a scientific language with marks indicating the particular individual and time, implying that generalities were always farther from reality.

But if you realize that all facts—whether an atom, an organism, or a process—are patterns of experience, if a person doesn't look for a pattern on the scale of generality, naturally they're not going to find it. It's the same as assuming everything an ant does is stupid.

For example, when people study cancer, the genetic people don't look for field phenomena, so they can't see them. But whenever someone looks for a cancer field, they see it's there. The definitive cancer cells are surrounded by a field of precancerous cells, fading off into inflamed or stressed cells. Without seeing the future phenomenon in any process, you get stuck with a reductionist jumble of meaningless particles.

The government has giant computers stuffed with observations of enzymes and genes, thinking they'll come up with something. But they're failing to look intelligently at the field behavior—the way the thing functions as a whole through time and space. That's the difference between the way von Bertalanffy looked at systems theory and the way P.K. Anokhin derived his more cybernetic approach.

**John Barkhausen:** You said Anokhin came up with the concept of feedback.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It became popularized in English by Norbert Wiener, but all of the concepts were developed about 15 years before that by P.K. Anokhin, who was one of Pavlov's colleagues. Anokhin saw that feedback was able to explain the development of an embryo meaningfully. Instead of the embryo being guided blindly by genetic reactions, each of the cells and systems was responding to the situation it found itself in at any moment and adjusting itself.

The genetic theory has this infinitely complex idea that all of these constantly changing developmental processes have to be held in the being somehow and read at the proper time. It is impossible when you try to guide it like clockwork from the inside. But when it's a matter of responsiveness to the presently perceived situation, it explains how an embryo develops.

**John Barkhausen:** So everything is self-organized from the whole right down to the cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of my professors of biochemistry, Sidney Bernhard, published a series of papers showing that all of the basic assumptions of biochemistry were wrong. The idea was that if you squash up a cell and float the enzymes in a solution, the particles will meet the enzyme by diffusion.

He showed that in glycolytic metabolism, the enzymes outnumber the substrate molecules. The reaction involves one enzyme handing off the product of its reaction to the next enzyme. So it isn't a random diffusion of material through water, but a totally organized enzyme-to-enzyme handoff. He did that simply by counting molecules. But they were so committed to this idea of randomness in a watery solution, they totally missed the point of what's happening in the cell.

## Listener Questions

**John Barkhausen:** We have a number of questions. One listener asks what you would recommend to a young person who wants to study biology, and another asks what research we can trust.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Don't trust anything. Just read it carefully and think about what they're doing and who they are. For example, I recently saw a discussion of the anti-cancer drug called Ukrain. Some English researchers offered to give it an objective test, but when the producer learned what they were going to do, he wanted an independent evaluation. They wrote articles in *The Lancet* saying the producer was unwilling to submit to an objective test. But when I looked at their previous publications, they were absolutely aligned with the cell-toxic chemotherapy industry.

Reading about the history of the person making the claim is part of the process. About nine times out of ten, it will show they have some ulterior motive. As for where to start, Gilbert Ling is a good place to reorient to how the biological community works and how they have ignored Ling for almost 60 years. I've looked at literature citing Ling and seen that when someone misquoted him, that misquotation went down through about a dozen repetitions. So one error led to deliberate misrepresentations of Gilbert Ling's work. When you really pay attention to Gilbert Ling, you see a lot of corruption in the biological community.

**John Barkhausen:** Another person asked if you put a book out with all of your dietary recommendations laid out in one place.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not really. It's coming out gradually in my newsletters.

**John Barkhausen:** Thanks so much, Ray.
