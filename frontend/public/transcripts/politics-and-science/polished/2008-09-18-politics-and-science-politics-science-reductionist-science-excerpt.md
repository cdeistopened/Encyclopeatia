## The Dogma of Inert Matter

**John Barkhausen:** You even said in one of your newsletters that the engineering, genetic dogma school of science thought memory was a function of brain cells dying—like holes being punched in an IBM computer card. They were postulating that that is how you remember things.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the history of science from the wrong perspective, it looks like a big comedy that is so farcical it's hard to believe. But these are top-notch, mainline people with these stupid theories.

**John Barkhausen:** I suppose they're coming from a certain point of view. They've all been educated in universities and done very well there, so they are trying to work within those parameters. If you look at life as a machine that doesn't have any intelligence, then I suppose an IBM punch card is a good model.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It comes down to the culture that teaches us. It has been going on for 800 years or so in philosophy, teaching us that matter is stupid, inanimate, and has nothing to do with the guiding principle of spirit and life. It is an invention that came out of a particular culture sometime after the Renaissance. It is the doctrine of matter as a special "devilish" material that has none of the life or spirit properties; it is just this mortal, essentially dead material.

The gene doctrine came in on top of things like Descartes' doctrine of the mind running an inanimate machine. The idea that matter has its own tendencies and principles was submerged under a doctrine that matter is essentially stupid and can only follow randomness.

Mathematical randomness has to be invoked when matter is treated. This applies to the idea of nuclear fission; there is a mathematical oversight that governs the half-life of each type of substance. However, people who questioned that idea of matter have done experiments showing that even nuclear decay is context-sensitive.

For example, I think it was 1971 when an experimenter used radioactive carbon in an oil form and found that the decay rate was non-random when it was made into a monolayer on a metal surface. That violated the whole doctrine of inert matter following mathematical rules of randomness, so no one paid attention to it.

Lots of physical experiments violate the rules, and people ignore them the way the genetics people ignored regeneration research or cancer cures. It was only the genetic engineers and the cloning researchers that finally opened up some space in the culture. The genetic engineers didn't want it to happen, but giving Barbara McClintock recognition and finally accepting that Dolly really had been cloned forced the issue. For 50 years, they had been denying the possibility of cloning, even when people were doing it with frogs.

The culture is being opened up by their own wrong thinking. It has led them into a corner where they are forced to recognize that something like a field is sometimes involved in biology.
