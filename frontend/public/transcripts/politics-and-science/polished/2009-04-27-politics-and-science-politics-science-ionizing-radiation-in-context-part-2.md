## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Today is the second in a series looking at the uses and abuses of radiation in our culture, with a particular focus on ionizing radiation—that is, nuclear technology. I'm very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat, endocrinologist, physiologist, and science historian from Eugene, Oregon, on the show. His website is raypeat.com.

## Linear Energy Transfer

**John Barkhausen:** Last week we talked about some of the systemic and long-term cumulative effects of X-rays and other types of radiation. We also discussed radiation from power plants. Many times, our medical establishment compares it to less harmful things like sunlight. You discussed that and pointed out that it's like comparing apples and oranges.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The key idea is linear energy transfer: how much of the energy actually gets into your tissue and interacts with it.

**John Barkhausen:** I see. And the ionizing radiation has far more energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some of it, like the isotopes that get into the air and food, release particles that have an extremely high energy transfer. Those are the worst. Others penetrate deeply and do damage along the way. But the intensity of the radiation isn't the main thing; it's how much they interact with your tissue and in what ways.

## The History of Medical Radiation

**John Barkhausen:** Could you give us a summary of how radioactive technology crept into our culture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost immediately when the Curies discovered how deadly poisonous radium and related isotopes were, the medical profession became very interested. It was a fancier way to destroy tissue instead of just poisons, surgery, cautery, and acid. They had a new technique that seemed technological and impressive. It very quickly went from treating warts and tumors to all kinds of bizarre quackery.

I knew people when I was in college whose facial bones were collapsing because they had X-ray treatment for acne, or whose hair had fallen out because they were treated for ringworm with X-rays. Total ignorance and arrogance combined to use whatever turned up.

**John Barkhausen:** And who was treating them? Just regular general practitioners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When I was a kid, shoe stores still had X-ray machines so anyone could look at their feet bones to see if the shoes fit. It was just a technological gadget that entertained people. Regular doctors had fluoroscopes that would let you watch a person breathe, watch their heart move, and watch their stomach and intestines. They were pumping nearly lethal doses of radiation into people, just standing there talking and watching for entertainment. Some of those things were putting out 50 to 100 rads in even a short treatment. If they had come in for a weekly exam, they would have soon been dead.

**John Barkhausen:** Just to compare that to a normal exposure from a chest X-ray, how much is that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I guess approaching a thousand times more. In the last few years, I've talked to people who had a combination of heart treatments where they put a tube or a wire up into the heart to open a clogged artery, using a fluoroscope to watch where it's going. These people get a tremendous amount of exposure. It's cumulative and can cause brain degenerative diseases. The heart surgeons who do that kind of work have a high incidence of brain cancer, so they are advised to wear a lead cap.

## Biological Effects and Gender Ratios

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The various types of physicians who work with radiation—radiologists and heart surgeons especially—have a higher rate of female children. That's the same as electricians who work around high-voltage power lines and the birds that nest near the high-tension lines. It doesn't have to be ionizing to have really major biological effects.

**John Barkhausen:** Why is it that they produce female children instead of male children?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Apparently, the male fertilized ovum, embryo, and fetus are weaker at all stages; the female has better resistance in general. Partly it's because all these types of radiation imitate estrogen in their biological actions, and estrogen tends to bias the sex ratio of the offspring.

## Amyloid Plaques and Aging

**John Barkhausen:** In the 40s, did doctors have any idea of the danger of X-rays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors generally only know what they're told is good practice. The information was available—chiropractors and borderline people in the medical profession had pamphlets in their offices in the 1940s giving references to the research literature showing that radiation accelerates the aging process. Meanwhile, real doctors were exposing their patients to doses that would not only accelerate aging but tremendously increase cancer mortality. Leukemia was extremely high in that period, not only from radioactive fallout from atmospheric bomb tests but from the medical X-rays of pregnant women and fluoroscoping of general patients.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like our culture was basically in love with modern technological gadgets.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just the same as it is now. Now, 60 years later, some of the best research is showing that radiation causes the formation of amyloid, the type of substance that is incriminated in Alzheimer's disease and degenerative lung, kidney, and pancreatic diseases.

**John Barkhausen:** Amyloid is a plaque?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a type of protein that forms plaques. Normally, the very common structure of a protein involves helix structures—a spiral piece of a chain of protein. With a certain disturbance, those spirals can break down and fold over against themselves, making a sheet arrangement called a pleated sheet. Those sheets can stick to a similar sheet structure in another protein. This array of pleated sheets forms a long fibrillation, and those fibrils condense into the visible plaques called amyloid.

**John Barkhausen:** And that's a common symptom in Alzheimer's patients.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it turns up in practically all aged tissues. It's accelerated by radiation, toxins, estrogen, and even microwaves and ultrasound.

## The Physics of Biology: Gilbert Ling and Water

**John Barkhausen:** We were talking to Professor Gilbert Ling a few weeks ago, and he was discussing the electrical nature of living tissue—how all the proteins and the water within a cell are in an electrical relationship.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's exactly where the problem is with all kinds of radiation and even toxins. The romantic classical physics people, who wanted to think mathematically about radiation, assured people that there was a threshold below which radiation wasn't harmful. This kind of thinking claimed that a unit of radio energy had to be sufficient to break a chain of DNA before anything happened biologically. That takes a direct hit and high energy.

But before the ionizing radiation actually has a direct hit and breaks a DNA chain, it's doing many much more subtle things, causing fluctuations in the electronic system of proteins and causing subtle changes in the way water relates to those proteins. If the medical world and physics had been paying closer attention to Gilbert Ling's work 50 years ago, most of these questions would have been settled in a very different way, with much more concern for protection than for promotion of industry.

**John Barkhausen:** So you feel the marketing side of our culture determined its medical course.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The people with an X-ray machine to sell will tell doctors that the dose is below the threshold. But these little sub-threshold doses actually modify the water structure, which directs the way the tissue develops and affects things like the immune system and the way nerves pattern themselves. In a young individual, that deviation can produce drastic and fatal effects very quickly. In mature people, it accelerates aging and degeneration.

## The Suppression of Dissenting Science

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People were already beginning to understand it in the 1930s. Thomas Edison became a great opponent of the medical use of X-rays. But the government, the nuclear industry, and the medical instrument corporations convinced the public that those researchers were unrealistic quacks.

Albert Szent-Györgyi was one of the people working on the subtle but essential biological interactions of electrons, water, and light. For 20 or 30 years, he was totally sidelined, even though he'd won the Nobel Prize. People who criticize industry become the victims of corporate government campaigns. The big nuclear corporations used to have weekly seminars to tell their staff that radiation was actually good for them. They would smear people who presented evidence of toxic effects, like Ernest Sternglass and Alice Stewart. Stewart showed that medical X-rays were probably the main cause of childhood cancer, but she was ridiculed.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think this mindset was connected to the military use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Once they started doing atmospheric tests, the military joined up with the X-ray industry. They had massive campaigns to tell the public that fallout was good for you. Campaigns were mounted using right-wing organizations like the John Birch Society to create scandals around professors who criticized the testing, getting them fired. The U.S. Public Health Service was a major player in that campaign to incriminate critics and hide evidence.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like the Cold War is when it really got bad regarding universities and public health services.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was no line between physics and biology. People with a biological orientation like Szent-Györgyi and Gilbert Ling were called quacks. The idea of acquired damage other than a random mutation was identified as a "Lysenko Soviet doctrine," so you had to be a certain kind of genetic dogmatist to teach biology in the United States after 1950.

## Physics, Philosophy, and Consciousness

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good place to get insight into how the system works is to start with German romantic physics in the 19th century. They wanted to subjectify physics and make it part of a spiritual quest for unity. Facts got in the way. That's where the Heisenberg principle came in—that you can't know things on the fine level; it's all ultimately random. It's a victory of subjective idealism over empirical science.

**John Barkhausen:** In terms of selling nuclear technology, it seems like Einstein's popularity played a big role.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That only becomes dangerous when they start saying that energy and information are the same, and that knowing and matter are the same. Einstein had an interesting exchange with Max Born about whether the field of a particle is part of the substance of the particle. Einstein's position was that the field should count as matter. But when you invoke the quantum ideas, you throw out matter and substitute mind and information.

**John Barkhausen:** So when you say the field is part of matter, that means the matter is part of its environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The whole world, including our knowledge of the world, is part of the same substantial stuff. For example, there are people who have demonstrated luminescence in the visual center of the brain; when we see a colored light, we actually light up with that color inside. You can think of our consciousness as a physical resonance. But the people who talk about information being transmitted along nerves as a simple on/off switch reduce knowledge to something mathematical.

## Uncertainty and Liability

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think that scientific attitude of quantum physics is used to say that even though radiation is there, we can't really *know* it causes harm? It seems to take away liability.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For decades, John Gofman went around working for the government saying that we can't know that this is causing damage. The idea was that you shouldn't act on anything you haven't tested empirically. Now, people are talking about a precautionary principle—that you should think about what harm might happen in the future, even if it hasn't been tested in the conventional scientific way.

**John Barkhausen:** It also sounds like quantum physics is a very good physics for an authoritarian culture.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you've ever listened to physics professors, you realize the whole culture has that authoritarian, textbook quality. They don't know anything if it isn't in the textbooks. And if you read the professional science textbooks, it's as interesting as reading novels. You can see the mind of the creator at work sorting out the things to be emphasized. They are almost always wrong in the textbooks.

## Nuclear Waste and Reprocessing

**John Barkhausen:** One of the arguments for bringing back nuclear power is that we should do what the French do: recycle spent fuel rods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a website called "Environmental Devastation Caused by Reprocessing Radioactive Waste." They mention that the French plant has annually discharged 100 million gallons of radioactive waste into the English Channel by way of an underwater pipeline. The industry and military also used to dump hundreds of thousands of barrels of radioactive waste into the ocean. Those barrels are leaking. The food chain from the English Channel has already drifted up to the Arctic and over to Canada.

**John Barkhausen:** The waste that's coming out of the pipes from reprocessing, is it contaminated water or particles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Particles. Huge amounts of uranium, plutonium, and strontium-90 are getting into the water, and the fish are taking it up.

**John Barkhausen:** That's really discouraging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The United States has two very contaminated areas: the Hanford plant in Washington and the dump in South Carolina. A nearby town found their well water was contaminated with uranium. I saw a huge truck coming up behind me in Northern California going about 90 miles an hour with a giant cylindrical tub on the back labeled "Greenville, South Carolina." The people who transport these giant vats of waste aren't the safest drivers.

## Medical Incineration

**John Barkhausen:** What about incineration of medical waste?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In general, they don't worry much about it. When they put radioactive iodine into a person, they don't worry about the person's urine. When bodies are incinerated, that goes into the air. If they die with radium needles in their organs, or just mercury in teeth, it gets vaporized.

## Cataracts as a Model for Radiation Damage

**John Barkhausen:** You talked about Alzheimer's being caused by nuclear waste or ionizing radiation. Does that correspond with sites near power plants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one is very clear about that, but I think it will turn out that it does. Cataracts are another interesting thing. They are easy to study because the cataract is a different state of living matter, probably analogous to what happens in Alzheimer's disease.

It turns out that in a cataract, the proteins aren't even denatured. The cataract is chemically almost identical to the surrounding tissue, but it has a slightly higher water content. All that happens is a slight fluctuation in the electronic state of the protein, which lets the water get out of control.

This shows how energy—not even thermal energy in the ordinary sense, but the vibrational state of water molecules—can make the difference between a lens that works and one that's opaque. Similar changes probably happen very early in cancer or Alzheimer's, long before you get the deposition of amyloid.

**John Barkhausen:** So the radiation is changing the structure in subtle ways long before visible damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If microwaves and ultraviolet light can do it, then relatively weak transmissions like a dental X-ray don't even have to ionize anything. All they have to do is add enough energy to cause this semi-thermal fluctuation of electrons and water vibrations.

## Protective Measures

**John Barkhausen:** Are there things people can do to fortify themselves if they have to be exposed to X-rays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keep your energy at a peak. Getting the damage done in the late afternoon in the summer is best. Keep your carbon dioxide up with adequate thyroid function, progesterone, pregnenolone, and testosterone. Magnesium is the best-established radiation-protective nutrient. Coffee happens to protect against all kinds of radiation damage because it provides magnesium and niacinamide, as well as protective caffeine and antioxidants.

**John Barkhausen:** Ray, thanks again for being here and for all your work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Goodbye.
