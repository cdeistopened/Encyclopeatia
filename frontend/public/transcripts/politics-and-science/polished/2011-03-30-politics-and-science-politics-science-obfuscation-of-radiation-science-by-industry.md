## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** I believe I have Dr. Raymond Peat here. This is Politics and Science on the 30th of March 2011. Dr. Peat is a physiologist and an endocrinologist from Eugene, Oregon, and has a website with a lot of excellent articles, mostly about physiology, at raypeat.com. Ray, thanks so much for coming on Politics and Science again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I didn't know it had been that long.

**John Barkhausen:** It actually has. But in light of the Fukushima power plant, which is in the process of melting down as we speak, I thought we should revisit radiation. We should do it in the context of your recent newsletter, "Radiation and Growth," which came out this January.

## T.D. Luckey and Radiation Hormesis

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason I wrote that newsletter last fall was two things. First, the TSA instruments that irradiate people got my interest up again in radiation. Then I saw that there were people selling radioactive rocks as therapeutic things—for example, to wear around your neck to cure breast cancer.

I saw that T.D. Luckey, who is now at least 90 years old, was interviewed by one of these "rock ladies" talking about his radioactive rock that he liked to rub. Since his history for 50 years has been serving the nuclear industry to tell people that radiation is good for you rather than harmful, I realized that with Obama and his nuclear industry support, T.D. Luckey and the radioactive rocks were just part of a new wave of promotion of radiation security ideas.

**John Barkhausen:** In this recent newsletter, you talked a little bit about how T.D. Luckey worked. He was a spokesman for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I heard about his talks. When I was talking about Ernest Sternglass and his low-level radiation book, people who worked in the nuclear industry told me, "Oh, that's rubbish. No one should read that stuff. It's all phony." I found out that they had been given weekly seminars at the nuclear factory to debunk people like John Gofman, Linus Pauling, and Sternglass. T.D. Luckey was one of the regulars at those industry seminars to educate the workers that those people were such lunatics and phonies that no respectable person should even look at their publications.

I looked up some of the references that T.D. Luckey cites. One of them was published in a right-wing crazy medical journal, and others are published in nuclear-supported radiation protection journals, basically giving the nuclear industry position and nothing from the real biologists.

**John Barkhausen:** How are listeners supposed to ascertain who has the accurate data and who doesn't?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you read the references cited by T.D. Luckey or any of these people propagandizing against Pauling and Gofman, and then read Sternglass's books, you can judge for yourself. Sternglass pried some information out of the agencies, although much of it was destroyed. But the information he got was very public, simple factual population information—mortality figures and so on. It is very sound and absolutely in a different world from the political fantasies that the Luckey people cite.

## Linus Pauling and Alpha Particles

**John Barkhausen:** Talking about Ernest Sternglass brings us back to some of the history you cover in this newsletter. I guess Sternglass worked with Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize winner, and they were both working to stop atomic testing. Can you explain why they got involved with that issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 50s, Linus Pauling was talking about the genetic effects of even one alpha-emitting atom ingested into the body. He said that an alpha particle delivers all of its energy to a very small area. If it hits a nucleus, it will either kill the nucleus or mutate it. He said that every mutation ultimately can be considered a fatality, even if it comes 100 generations later, because it's not introducing anything of value but simply destroying information.

He emphasized the mutation damage done by any radioactive isotope, natural or artificial. The terrible thing is that the fallout from nuclear reactors and atomic bombs gets into the atmosphere as particles. When ingested, if they stay in the body, they will eventually emit a particle which will either kill a cell or probably cause a mutation.

He was making the point about the absolute difference between radiation that you get while walking past a granite bank—which passes through and delivers very little energy—and any single alpha-emitting isotope that you swallow. The isotope delivers all of its energy as that alpha particle is absorbed by the cells.

## The Problem with Sieverts

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The RAD is the absorbed dose of radiation, and the REM (or Sievert) is the equivalent in a person. The Sievert is the new unit referring to that effective dose. Unfortunately, that effective dose is part of obscuring the actual dangers because they define "effectiveness" as a killing or a mutation.

The people defending the industry use this Sievert unit against the Pauling, Gofman, and Sternglass people. Their journals are full of studies showing how harmless particular types of radiation are. If you don't kill the cell instantly and don't mutate it so that you can find a broken chromosome right after the exposure, they claim you have done no harm. That is where the situation is totally being falsified.

## Sternglass: Infant Mortality and SAT Scores

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sternglass was forced to recognize that there is something far beyond mutation and killing effects. He saw changes happening around Three Mile Island. He found large numbers of stillbirths, thyroid-deficient babies, and miscarriages by mothers after they had ingested the isotopes.

When he followed up all across the country, he looked at the miscarriages and thyroid deficiencies, and they followed just in the number of months that you would expect from the damage to the developing embryo. It was the same with the production of leukemia; intrauterine exposure was producing leukemia.

Then he looked at the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores 18 years later. In Utah, there was a 26% decrease in scores 18 years after the heaviest exposure to bomb tests. Right across the country, the scores decreased in proportion to the radiation exposure of the mothers 18 years earlier.

The first response was that more poor kids were now taking the test. Sternglass showed that was wrong. He looked at the high range; the very highest-scoring students had decreased more. They were the most sensitive to the destructive effects of prenatal radiation exposure.

## The Bystander Effect and Genomic Instability

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the industry people pretty much have to accept that the women exposed to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs while pregnant had children with smaller brains and mental retardation in proportion to the radiation they got. That was blamed on the killing of brain cells.

But just recently, a study in Seattle of women getting dental X-rays showed that if they got a whole set of dental X-rays, the pregnant women delivered underweight babies. Something happened when their head was irradiated that was transmitted to their whole body and made the pregnancy less successful. When the baby is born underweight, the brain is also underweight.

Fifty years after the bomb in Japan, and 20 years after Chernobyl, samples of workers' serum were tested. Their serum was added to healthy cells, and it was able to cause mutations or chromosome breaks even 20 to 50 years after they had been exposed.

**John Barkhausen:** I would think that if somebody had survived for 20 years with those toxic effects in their blood, then the body was coping with it. Is that not true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, the exposed people had worse health and a higher rate of death from all causes—infectious diseases, heart disease, cancer. But the healthiest of them who survived a long time still were radically injured.

Studies have been done showing that radiation to a man's head will be associated with birth defects in his offspring. Something is transmitted through his body, affects his sperm, and destabilizes them genetically. Animal studies show that sort of effect can go on generation after generation, often getting worse each generation.

## John Gofman’s Reversal

**John Barkhausen:** How were Ernest Sternglass and Linus Pauling received when they campaigned to stop above-ground testing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was one of the people talking about the difference between John Gofman and Linus Pauling. John Gofman was saying Linus Pauling was a neurotic and a quack. I was saying that John Gofman is either insane or a liar. Twenty years later, Gofman suddenly had an insight and said that was the stupidest thing he could have ever done. But he was doing it regularly as his profession for the government—campaigning against Linus Pauling.

**John Barkhausen:** He was one of the main spokesmen for the Atomic Energy Agency, wasn't he?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And his old stupid arguments are still found in the professional journals of radiation protection.

**John Barkhausen:** Any insight into how he happened to change his mind?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He said he was in the middle of a talk and realized it was a crazy thing to say that until we *know* we're destroying all future generations, we should go on testing. He later said that he and hundreds of other people in similar positions could be tried for war crimes.

## Cosmic Rays vs. Nuclear Fallout

**John Barkhausen:** Can you explain why cosmic radiation isn't the same as ionizing radiation from fallout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The essential thing is Linear Energy Transfer (LET). The higher the velocity of a particle, the less likely it is to stop in your tissue. If you look at a track of a particle going through tissue, when you find one that is losing enough energy that it's coming to rest, the ionization becomes extremely intense. At the very last micron of movement, it delivers all of its remaining energy right in that cell.

But if it passes through you at a high velocity, very little radiation is lost. The type of radiation we're exposed to when a primary cosmic ray goes through us is the high-velocity type. It is weakly deflected, and the energy delivered is very small.

Experiments have shown that secondary and tertiary particles—the ones slowing down—are mostly ending right near the surface of the earth. Those are the ones doing most of the biological damage. So, as far as cosmic rays are concerned, it's actually worse to live at sea level. But the industry argues the reverse—that high altitude is where you get the worst radiation. They turn the evidence upside down to support their interests.

**John Barkhausen:** You're saying the radon actually ends up in your brain if you're exposed to it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The industry says since you breathe radon, you would expect lung cancer. But since people exposed to radon in homes don't have more lung cancer, they claim radiation is good for you. But it goes through your lung in a fraction of a second. Radon dissolves in fat tissue. The brain is mostly fat, so that is where you get most of the radon exposure. Figures show that dementia corresponds very closely to radon exposure.

## Mechanism of the Bystander Effect

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carmel Mothersill and her collaborators have demonstrated the "bystander effect"—what is transmitted through body fluids. They showed you can irradiate cells in a culture dish, take the fluid from those cells, add it to fresh cells, and those fresh cells behave as if they had been irradiated.

One of the transmitters they identified is serotonin. They found that serotonin produced by the radiation-damaged cells was enough to transmit genomic instability to new cells.

**John Barkhausen:** That's without any extra radiation added?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's just the indirect effect transmitted through the fluids. If they irradiated fish in water and then put new fish in the water, the new fish suffered similar effects transmitted from the secretions of the injured fish.

## Chernobyl: UN vs. Independent Science

**John Barkhausen:** The World Health Organization and the IAEA have issued studies about Chernobyl that radically differ from a Russian study that came out a year ago. The UN basically said only the immediate workers were harmed. The Russian study said over a million people have died.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Western journals reviewing about 300 Western articles concluded that 28 people died, or maybe as many as 60 or 70. The group that wrote the Russian book looked at 5,000 studies and concluded that a million people were killed.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like science is a political occupation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the idea of having a "consensus" of scientists. I see it as exactly the same as people who form their political views by taking a consensus of what the network newscasters are saying.

**John Barkhausen:** George Monbiot recently wrote that the events at Fukushima convinced him that nuclear power is the answer because hardly anyone was hurt, basing that on the UN reports. Helen Caldecott thought that was an outrageous lie. Can you give us your take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The UN is primarily the instrument of the imperialist countries. The nuclear industry wouldn't exist without the political support of the states, which represent corporate interests. The public is taxed to finance the nuclear industry, and the corporations support the universities and the media. Helen Caldecott is threatening to hurt the interests of the nuclear industry, so the whole system has to exclude people like that.

## Protective Measures

**John Barkhausen:** We have a few minutes left. Can you outline what people can do to minimize their exposure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a very intense cloud comes by with a lot of radioactive iodine, the thyroid is the first thing that can be protected. Eating iodine-rich foods or taking enough thyroid to suppress your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) will make the gland inactive so you don't take up the radioactive iodine. A spoonful of powdered kelp will pretty well saturate your body.

However, the iodine danger passes in about six weeks. If you take too much iodine and suppress the function of your thyroid gland, you're going to slow all of your metabolic processes, including the DNA repair enzymes. So, keeping your metabolic rate high by avoiding toxic foods is very important for long-range resistance.

For long-range things like cesium and strontium, you want to help wash those out of your body. Eating a calcium-rich and potassium-rich diet will increase the turnover of these in your tissues. A thyroid-supporting diet low in polyunsaturated fats will increase the repair processes and prevent, to some extent, those long-range bystander effects.

**John Barkhausen:** And you mentioned red light before. Is that effective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you have a CAT scan or some kind of very intense radiation, those effects will linger as excited molecules in your tissue for hours. If in the first hour after exposure you get lots of sunlight, or bright incandescent light rich in the red spectrum, it deactivates those excited electrons.

**John Barkhausen:** I suppose it would be best to avoid milk from cows eating in the field?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, I looked at the figures 40 or 50 years ago regarding radiation in milk versus vegetables. I saw that if you ate vegetables for your nutrients, you would be getting several times more strontium than you would from the milk. The cow concentrates calcium, whereas plants tend to receive a high proportion of strontium from the fresh fallout. So the cow is actually a good filter even during the fallout storm.

**John Barkhausen:** Ray, thanks so much for your knowledge and advice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
