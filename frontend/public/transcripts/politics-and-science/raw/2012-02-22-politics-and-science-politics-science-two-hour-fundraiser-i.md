**Speaker A** (00:00): I don't think they've ever used progesterone itself. In a study in humans going back to the 40s, when progesterone was just barely becoming available, people were using it to treat cancer in humans, but it was just on an individual basis. And there have been quite a few publications using medroxyprogesterone stuff, which is not progesterone, to treat kidney cancer and breast cancer and such. And it works somewhat, but it isn't progesterone and doesn't have all of the good properties of progesterone and has some of the bad properties. So the best information is still from animal studies. And even those pretty much faded out after lip shoots left the field in the 50s.

**Speaker B** (01:05): I thought I remembered one with women who had cervical cancer where they were injecting progesterone.

**Speaker A** (01:12): Oh, yeah, yeah, that was.

**Speaker B** (01:13): Was that Medoxin progesterone?

**Speaker A** (01:15): It was just a few women that was real progesterone. But I. It was only a few women and they were just. They had diagnosed them as being incurable, and so they were willing to see what happened. They were trying to cure it. And they had people they photographed and felt the condition of the cervix at the start, and then they injected what they thought were big doses, but they never mentioned that any of the women were anesthetized, which happens when you give a big dose. So we don't really know how much the women were getting because they were injecting it in vegetable oil, which is an unpredictable solvent. And so if they weren't getting anesthetized to any extent that anyone noticed, they were hardly getting anything more than a physiological dose. But still, during the course of the study, they saw a great improvement in the appearance and feeling and symptoms. The bleeding decreased, the lumpiness decreased, and so on. It looked less like cancer after a few weeks of treatment. But since they didn't do the experiment intending to cure cancer, they went ahead and cut out the uteruses after a certain number of weeks had elapsed and concluded that progesterone had no promise as a treatment. The article is mostly interesting for the weird conclusion. And then the article published right next to that in the same book, was about treating breast cancer with estrogen. And as many of the patients got worse as got better with the estrogen, and they concluded that this stuff has great promise. Those two articles, published right against each other, are most interesting for the degree of psychosis that goes unnoticed in medical science.

**Speaker B** (03:53): And maybe in our society in general. It's Funny. You were pointing out the dominance of the estrogen industry over the last couple shows. And I was thinking that's kind of analogous to the dominance of estrogen in the sick person without the progesterone to oppose it. And it seems like the same thing is happening in our society, which indicates to me that there's something wrong.

**Speaker A** (04:23): Yeah. This one study, I think, is still going on. I think his initials are D.G. stein was the leader of the study giving progesterone within the first 24 hours after a catastrophic head injury and finding that the people survive when they get estrogen and recover remarkably well instead of just progressing to dead.

**Speaker B** (04:54): So it's very effective, as you said, for any kind of injury. Stopping excitation.

**Speaker A** (05:03): Yeah, Stops edema and excitation and deterioration of any tissue, but especially noticeable in the brain because edema is deadly in the brain.

**Speaker B** (05:19): And as Ray pointed out in the last few shows, that it's not a money maker. To put it simply, progesterone is not patentable. Perhaps you could. I mean, they've. You said they've tried to alter the molecule some so they could patent it, but those artificial progestins, they call them, actually have estrogenic effects.

**Speaker A** (05:45): Yeah, either estrogenic or androgenic or in some cases, glucocorticoid effects. And just recently I saw an article emphasizing the difference between the real progesterone and the medroxyprogesterone that was used in the Women's Health Initiative study. And this person was sort of sounding annoyed that people were making the confusion, but I don't know how influential that publication will be.

**Speaker B** (06:27): And the medroxyprogesterone is actually what's called a progestin. If you're taking hormone replacement therapy, you think you're getting progesterone, but you're probably just getting progestin.

**Speaker A** (06:40): Yeah. It's similar enough to progesterone that it turns off your own production of progesterone. And the odd thing about real progesterone is that if you aren't producing enough of it and you take some, you produce more of reinforces the system for its own production. Just exactly the opposite of what the synthetic progestins do.

**Speaker B** (07:07): I see on the same subject of cancer, somebody brought up the point that the Craig B. Thompson, president and CEO of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center, has something on YouTube where he discusses new ways to think about cancer and how cancer arises in humans. And I'm going to accept this call here. He concludes that at the end that if you overfeed someone with fat, you do not increase their rise of cancer at all. If you overfeed someone with carbohydrates, you dramatically increase the cancer rate and protein is halfway in between. And this person would like to hear your response to that.

**Speaker A** (07:57): Oh, I haven't read it, but I've seen a couple of other things that I think are equally crazy. Gary Tobes or Tobbs has an article in Science about a year ago saying basically the same thing, which I think he got his idea from Dr. Lundstig's video. But I have read lots of studies on the subject and going back almost 100, well, 90 years anyway, I think the evidence is very clear that fat is the main. Unsaturated fat is, if not the only, at least by far the largest promoter of cancer. Not just in humans, but everywhere they look. And the interesting thing about carbohydrate is that the fats that we make out of carbohydrate when we eat an excess of it are anti growth of cancer. They lower the amount of unsaturated fats circulating in our blood and they have a shift effect on the metabolism of cancer cells. They tend to restore oxidative metabolism and suppress aerobic glycolysis, which is the characteristic cancer metabolism. So this guy, he might have some bit of evidence in mind, but if he doesn't mention the 99% of the overwhelmingly opposing evidence, there's something wrong with his presentation.

**Speaker B** (10:03): Yeah, he doesn't distinguish between fats, he just says fat or carbohydrate.

**Speaker A** (10:08): Yeah, one of the ways they trick the experiment so it looks like they can improve their sales of fish fat or whatever is to give, give the most toxic fat as to the control animals and their test substance, such as beef fat to the other animals. And the fish happens to oxidize so quickly that it doesn't reach the cells in quantity as great as the seed oil does. And if they're feeding a comparison between fat and sugar, for example, they'll make sure to add the carcinogenic required amount of thin oleic acid to the diet. So then the sugar all goes into storage, but the animal is still being exposed to the crucial carcinogenic amount of linoleic acid. I've looked at probably 150 articles that claim to have results of that, sort of. And they're all. It's hard to imagine that they weren't designing it just to get the results they want.

**Speaker B** (11:33): Well, we should probably get back to that in a minute. We have a caller on the Line. Gene, are you there?

**Speaker C** (11:40): Oh, yes, yes, sorry. I should listen. I didn't listen before I called in. Hi, a couple of questions if it's okay. One I tried. I haven't eaten dairy food much dairy food for many years and I've been trying your diet and I started drinking milk, whole raw milk, and my sinuses got stuffed up again.

**Speaker A** (12:11): Is there any what happened?

**Speaker C** (12:14): My sinuses got clogged up. Well, I've always had that problem.

**Speaker A** (12:25): I wouldn't necessarily recommend whole milk or raw milk unless you're familiar with the particular cows. And if you get a bad result from one dairy or one cow, then try another one that feeds the cow something different. I've felt the difference myself just between local dairies and in a supermarket. There was one brand of milk that was always cheaper and tasted a little funny and I always got sick when I drank it. And there are so many things that can go wrong. All milk except whole milk, and maybe even that now. But the government requires the addition of vitamin A and D to all of the commercial milk supplies. And those dairies don't like to tell how they add those vitamins. But generally there is some diluent that the vitamins are carried in probably an emulsifier so that they don't stick to the sides of the vessels or float to the top. So.

**Speaker C** (13:49): This milk was from a local organic raw dairy. Raw milk, you know, with the cream mixed in. And I've had the same problem drinking or eating dairy from many different sources throughout many years. I seem to have the same response, whether it's from store bought or, you know. Right. From the cow or whatever.

**Speaker A** (14:13): Yeah. Do you get that from cottage cheese or cheese?

**Speaker C** (14:17): Yes.

**Speaker A** (14:18): Or from goat milk.

**Speaker C** (14:20): I don't like goat milk. I don't like the taste of that.

**Speaker A** (14:27): So it's undoubtedly some kind of digestive problem, but it's just a matter of experimenting different kinds of cheese. Have you noticed an effect on your sinus symptoms?

**Speaker C** (14:46): Yeah, usually once in a while it doesn't bother me, but most of the time it does. I don't have any digestive problems, just sinus and my lungs get. I get mucus in my lungs as well or I cough up mucus.

**Speaker A** (15:06): How the mucus gets there is that your intestine is being irritated and the irritation is either that you have bacteria growing on the food or the food itself contains allergens. And very often just by changing the dairy or the type of cheese or cooking it rather than eating it raw, you can find which things cause the mucus reaction. But it isn't that the milk gets into your blood and causes mucus production in your head or lungs. It's reaction from your intestine.

**Speaker B** (15:51): Hey, Gene, could you stand back from your microphone or talk a little softer? It's. It's your. You're a little too loud.

**Speaker C** (15:57): Oh, okay, sure. Yeah. I've been working with Lita Li, and she suggests that I drink cream instead of milk to solve the problem.

**Speaker A** (16:07): Drink what kind?

**Speaker C** (16:08): Cream rather than milk.

**Speaker A** (16:12): I've never heard of anyone trying that, but I would say try some homemade skimmed milk, cottage cheese first.

**Speaker C** (16:24): Okay. All right. Is that better, John?

**Speaker B** (16:31): That's a little better. You can even back up more because you're coming, I think, because you're so close. It's very loud.

**Speaker C** (16:37): Okay, well, thank you. My second question is, I have a relative who's been diagnosed with chronic superficial gastritis and also inflamed duodenum. What would you suggest there?

**Speaker A** (16:59): Have they been checked with an endoscopy for bacteria or exactly what the condition is?

**Speaker C** (17:10): This was through a. Yes, yes. Through a colonoscopy and also through the throat.

**Speaker A** (17:19): And did they find that they had any bacterial problem growing up in the duodenum or stomach?

**Speaker C** (17:28): I believe so, but I'm not positive. He's had severe stomach pain for two or three years. It's been getting worse and lots of diarrhea.

**Speaker A** (17:44): It's good to check things like the thyroid, but also to consider an elimination diet. There are so many foods, even natural, fresh foods, you can rank them according to their likelihood to support bacterial growth. And then there are lots of food additives that are definitely anything. With carrageenan, for example, it's causing a lot of cases of inflammation of the stomach, bowel, diarrhea, constipation. And chenan is showing up in an incredible number of foods, everything from organic whipping cream to squid patties.

**Speaker C** (18:46): Okay, we'll check. We'll work on that. All right.

**Speaker B** (18:54): Anything else, Gene?

**Speaker C** (18:59): Not at the moment.

**Speaker B** (19:01): All right. Hey, Ray, hang on just a sec. Gene, is there any use in sneaking up on the milk consumption? Just doing a little bit at a time.

**Speaker A** (19:14): If a person thinks. If they think they might have a problem digesting the lactose or any food that's chemically different, then if you drink two or three ounces at a meal, that exposes the intestine to the new chemical. And in a week or two, or at most a month or two, the enzymes usually will express themselves, even though they might have been gone for years. You can usually induce them in a few Weeks by these small samples, just a half a glass at a time. So there's not enough to feed the bacteria significantly, but enough to sort of tickle the enzyme system in the getting active.

**Speaker C** (20:12): I actually started with just a couple of ounces a day. And as soon as I. As soon as I did, I had that response.

**Speaker B** (20:26): All right, and what about. Were you going to ask about the enzymes gene? We talked about that on Monday. Was that something?

**Speaker C** (20:33): Oh, yeah. As I said, I've been working with Lita Li, I guess you know her. Right. And she has recommended I take a number of enzyme supplements. Are you familiar with those?

**Speaker A** (20:53): Yeah, but I'm very cautious with any kind of a pill shaped supplement.

**Speaker C** (21:01): Me too.

**Speaker A** (21:03): In the process, there are so many allergens that can enter. So anything that especially involves microorganisms, you want to be very cautious. A couple of people have told me that when they took the pure free amino acids that they got incredibly sick. And you have to be really cautious and maybe take a half a tablet as a trial and wait three days or so just to make sure you handle it. The same with any supplement. Vitamin C supplements can cause terrible problems for people. I've seen people who had terrible sinus symptoms for years and years, and when I just suggested they lay off their vitamin supplements for a week, they didn't ever have a runny nose again.

**Speaker B** (22:07): Not too much of a testimonial for vitamins.

**Speaker A** (22:11): Yeah. For a while I was counseling at an alternative health place in Eugene where allergies in the summer. Because of the grass fields around Eugene, allergies were a big problem. And for a couple of years I had a reputation for curing everyone's allergies by getting them to stop their vitamins.

**Speaker B** (22:38): Wow.

**Speaker C** (22:40): Are you familiar with Lyme disease and any connection with that and thyroid?

**Speaker A** (22:47): Yeah. Hypothyroidism is often misdiagnosed as Lyme disease. Candida is the other thing that is. Commonly, if you can't find the cause, then Lyme disease and Candida are the first suspects. But usually it's just hypothyroidism.

**Speaker C** (23:09): What if you test positive for Lyme?

**Speaker A** (23:14): Well, lots of people do. There's some overlap with other. We all tend to be exposed to spirochetes and there's overlap with other spirochetes. And a course of antibiotics for a week or two is a way to eliminate it. The Lyme disease can be eradicated, just as syphilis would be, for example. But by avoiding looking for other causes, such as hypothyroidism, some Doctors make a good business out of. Out of the Lyme treatments forever.

**Speaker C** (24:01): I've been working with a naturopathic doctor who, he recommends, you know, antibiotics for the initial onset of Lyme, but then mostly herbs. And what he says, I guess a number of people say, is that the antibiotics force the spirochete to create a hard shell around themselves, and they go into the shell, which is why the symptoms desist after antibiotics. But then over time, the spirochetes break out of the shell and. And migrate around your. Your body, especially in joints and stuff, which is why people experience joint pain years after the initial onset of the Lyme. Well.

**Speaker A** (24:58): If they haven't eliminated an endocrine problem. Very. What I see is that the hypothyroid people with low immune function also get the whole range of symptoms that are blamed on that, such as arthritis. And if you can cure the disease by correcting the thyroid, it's a lot easier. About 40 or 45 years ago, a friend of mine had an accident working on his house, and the stress of it apparently brought on severe arthritis. And he went to his doctor, who examined him and didn't prescribe cortisone for his arthritis. He prescribed thyroid armor, thyroid supplement, because he saw he was hypothyroid. And my friend was really annoyed, went home grumbling. The doctor had fixed something that he thought wasn't broken. Week or two of taking the thyroid, his arthritis disappeared and never came back. But not many doctors are aware of connections such as injury, stress, arthritis, hypothyroidism. Most doctors would prescribe at that best cortisone to treat the symptoms. But I think a lot of the Lyme doctors are doing a similar thing, making a simple problem complex.

**Speaker B** (26:53): Ray, is it possible that the bite from the tick triggers some antithyroid response?

**Speaker A** (27:04): Well, probably low thyroid people. I have a bigger inflammatory response and probably are more likely to fail to throw off the infection.

**Speaker B** (27:18): I see.

**Speaker A** (27:20): So if you have the diagnosis, it's good to take a course of antibiotics, but antibiotics, a good combination of antibiotics. It's well established as a cure.

**Speaker B** (27:36): I see.

**Speaker A** (27:38): All right.

**Speaker B** (27:39): You have another question? Gene.

**Speaker A** (27:43): You'Re starting to break up again.

**Speaker B** (27:45): Oh, how is it now? Is it still terrible?

**Speaker A** (27:48): It's hardly.

**Speaker B** (27:50): Okay, let's see if it corrects itself in a minute. Gene, whenever you move around, there's a huge amount of noise, too, on the radio, so.

**Speaker C** (28:00): I can't understand what you're saying.

**Speaker B** (28:01): Okay, let me. I'm going to reconnect the call, and we'll start over.

**Speaker C** (28:06): Okay.

**Speaker B** (28:06): Okay.

**Speaker A** (28:07): Okay.

**Speaker C** (28:07): Yep.

**Speaker B** (28:11): All right. You're listening to WMRW LP Warren, this is special wacky fundraiser show with Dr. Raymond Pete. Ray's not wacky, but the technology is amusing. Skype to try to do a call in show and it's our fundraiser. So if you'd like to contribute to WMRW, you can go to WMRW.org and click on the pig.

**Speaker A** (28:45): Hi.

**Speaker B** (28:46): Hey. We're back.

**Speaker A** (28:47): Okay.

**Speaker B** (28:48): And Gene, are you still there? No, we lost Gene too. So the phone line is open again and I should Repeat it. It's 802-5262-326802-52626. If you have a computer with Skype in it and you're sitting in front of it, you can also Skype John Barkhausen. And we should probably open the lineup for some other people. Gene's back. Hey Gene.

**Speaker C** (29:14): Yes?

**Speaker B** (29:15): Yeah. Do you have another question we should probably see if somebody else wants to get into?

**Speaker C** (29:20): Sure. Try someone else. And if they don't, I'll come back with another one.

**Speaker B** (29:24): Ok, great. Is the streaming working? All right.

**Speaker C** (29:27): It is now, yeah.

**Speaker B** (29:28): Okay, great. All right, well, we'll talk to you probably in a little bit.

**Speaker C** (29:33): Should I stay on?

**Speaker B** (29:34): It's better for the noise level to not be on because every little noise in the background distracts.

**Speaker C** (29:39): Oh, so I can listen on the radio and then call in if no one else.

**Speaker B** (29:43): Yeah, that'd be great.

**Speaker C** (29:45): Okay, thanks.

**Speaker B** (29:45): Okay, thanks. And so you think Lyme Ray has an initial infection that can be affected by antibiotics, but most likely it's not the cause of the tiredness and somehow it's triggered hypothyroidism. Ah, so we lost Ray again. On hold. Hello, this is wmrwlp warren with series of mess ups. Calling back Dr. Raymond Peet, who has a PhD in biology and has done extensive research. Hey Ray. Yeah, one more time. This could get old. So I was just asking. So you really think Lyme disease is just a thyroid problem that's triggered by the.

**Speaker A** (31:03): By the immune? No, not the disease, but the diagnosis. I would say 80 or 90% of the people that I've talked to have been to doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating it chronically.

**Speaker B** (31:21): I see. And have you had luck treating people for Lyme?

**Speaker A** (31:26): Yeah. Well, no, no, but they get well.

**Speaker B** (31:30): I see.

**Speaker A** (31:32): And forget about the Lyme diagnosis.

**Speaker B** (31:35): I get you. So you give them nutritional advice?

**Speaker A** (31:40): Yeah.

**Speaker B** (31:40): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (31:43): And I think the power of undigested food is very underestimated.

**Speaker B** (31:54): Can you explain that?

**Speaker A** (31:56): Well, Overcooking food like people used to do 100 years ago. It's much better for the digestion because we aren't designed to eat undercooked or raw vegetable matter. Bacteria can eat it. And if someone happens to have just the right mix of bacteria, their bacteria can eat their vegetables secondarily and release some of the nutrients. But if you get the wrong bacteria, then they produce toxins rather than nutrients.

**Speaker B** (32:40): And that's the endotoxin problem that you've referred to.

**Speaker A** (32:44): Yeah.

**Speaker B** (32:46): Which basically poisons your system and taxes your liver.

**Speaker A** (32:51): Yeah, endotoxin and many other things. Allergens released from the specific plant material, as well as bacterial toxins.

**Speaker B** (33:03): I don't know if we discussed this on the air before, but it's always amazed me that you talk about endotoxin all the time. If you look it up on the Internet, there's a lot of information about it. It's a real thing. It actually causes severe problems. And that seems to be well recognized. But I've talked to several doctors, internists about it. Smart people. They've never ever heard of it.

**Speaker A** (33:28): I guess they forgot that section in medical school during a generation or two. But in the 19th century, the intestine was a big focus of, of Anglo American medicine and some other European varieties. But especially the English and Americans were very interested in what the intestine does to the whole system. The brain, intestine symptom interactions, and the other organs as they're influenced by the intestine. That was still pretty big up until 1920, and there was a campaign against it. Walter C. Alvarez, a newspaper endurologist, helped to suppress the intestine culture. In popular medicine, for example, there was a belief that migraines or headaches in general were produced by toxins absorbed from the intestine. And he was of the new school that didn't want to think about the intestine so much, even though he was a gastroenterologist. So he stuffed wads of cotton into his medical students rectums and reported that the next morning a certain proportion of them had headaches caused just by the pressure in the rectum. He said, so you see, headaches are caused by pressure, not by toxins. But he didn't put any toxins in his student's intestines. So he didn't disprove the idea, but it was just a little propaganda bit. But the other people, Russians for example, studied in more detail that intact toxins, nutrition and pressure interact very meaningfully. In an experimental animal, for example, they would put a balloon in the intestine and blow it up and nothing would happen. The animal would keep functioning. But if they gave the animal hypoglycemia and then blew up the intestine, unpredictable things would happen all through the rabbit. It would have hormonal and neurological reactions triggered just by that pressure of blowing up a balloon in the intestine could cause seizures or wheezing or all kinds of widespread reactions.

**Speaker B** (36:39): And that's when you have low blood sugar. That's when it's particularly dangerous to have blockages.

**Speaker A** (36:46): Yeah. And French and Canadian researchers, instead of using pressure, they combined allergens. They would feed a bed of walnut to an animal and would maybe sneeze from the allergens in it. Then they would give it moderate hypoglycemia and feed it the same thing and it would die in shock. And then if they would give another bunch of animals slight hyperglycemia by infusing some glucose and feed them the same walnut or whatever, they wouldn't even sniffle.

**Speaker B** (37:31): Wow. So that goes along with what you said, that sugar or glucose is protective. So it's. Yeah, it's very important to keep your blood sugar up.

**Speaker A** (37:41): Yeah. I think the particular researcher who did that was named Adamki Wix and it was published in a book by Yasmin or Jasmin J A S M I N Gaiton Yasmin.

**Speaker B** (37:58): And why was Alvarez so opposed to the research that was done in the 18th, 1800s? I have a book of his and he seems like a very reasonable fellow.

**Speaker A** (38:09): Yeah, he was very entertaining and intelligent, but he was just a modern that wanted to get away from the old fashioned country doctor who cured everything with laxative.

**Speaker B** (38:24): I see. And so as long as we're on the subject of digestion, how important is it that people have regular bowel movements?

**Speaker A** (38:40): I think like the person who popularized fiber 40, 50 years ago in the US was studying the African relative freedom from bowel problems, cancer. And he saw that they typically would have three bowel movements a day and that they ate lots of potatoes, that it was the fiber in the potato stimulating the intestine that seemed to protect their bowel. So he published things about the benefits of fiber. And the cereal industry in the US started selling oat bran as the preventive of colon cancer, which caught on in the 70s. But then in the 80s, some Australians tested oat bran diets on animals and found that it promoted increase the incidence of bowel cancer. Apparently by the nature of the breakdown product.

**Speaker B** (39:56): Yeah. I don't think that knowledge has ever gotten around.

**Speaker A** (40:01): Not very well. But in general, fiber does clean the intestine and keeping it moving lowers the estrogen level. Reabsorption, the bile puts out get tries to get rid of toxic materials including estrogen. And if you don't have a regular movement through the intestine, a lot of that gets recycled, reabsorbed and raises your general exposure to toxins, including estrogen.

**Speaker B** (40:41): All right, well, that's a good answer. I better get to some of the questions that have come in by email. I keep thinking we have so much time because it's a two hour show, but if we have any more mess ups with the phone system, it may be a short show. So let me get to these questions. There's one here from Keenan asking.

**Speaker A** (41:08): What.

**Speaker B** (41:08): Do you think of medicinal marijuana in its relationship to cancer and aids? Is it efficacious if I can say that?

**Speaker A** (41:23): Well, it helps with the nausea if a person is having symptoms and can control the symptoms with it. It's very effective for many people. And the tea? When I was 10, a doctor gave me a bag, didn't say what it was, but prescribed a cup of tea every day. And years later I recognized the taste of it as marijuana. But really? Yeah, it was supposed to prevent my headaches, but it didn't do anything noticeable for me. But it is, it used to be prescribed a lot as a tea and I think it's a lot safer that way than smoking it because the smoke itself is carcinogenic and estrogenic and the various chemicals in the leaf are themselves slightly estrogenic or antiandrogenic. So I think that's probably the main concern for someone who's using it regularly. But I think there are other probably healthier solutions for nausea. The antiseratonin drugs and simply increasing the blood sugar, salt and sugar very often help with nausea.

**Speaker B** (43:03): Okay, well, thanks. We have another caller on the line. Roger, are you there?

**Speaker D** (43:08): Yeah.

**Speaker C** (43:08): Hi.

**Speaker B** (43:08): Hi, this is Ray Pete on the line with you.

**Speaker D** (43:12): Hi, Dr. Pete. Thank you for taking my call. My question centers around omega 3 fatty acids. A couple years ago I came across a supplement of whole fish oil, salmon fish oil that contained omega 3s and it was touted as being a great supplement to help arthritis and lower triglyceride glyceride levels and that kind of thing. And then I read your research, which sort of contradicted all of these things that I was hoping that fish oil would do, like save my a great antioxidant and reverse my aging process probably about 20 years. But I Was wondering if you could elaborate on, on what you found and explain what you think the dangers are of taking supplements of fish oil. Because I've been seeing that these fatty acids, the Omega 3s are showing up in all kinds of organic products like organic milk and baby formula. That seems kind of dangerous to me. If there's a problem with the supplement.

**Speaker A** (44:39): Yeah. Someone two or three years ago analyzed the baby formulas and found that the great bulk of the omega minus 3 fat that had been added to it had broken down and was probably in a toxic form. So their worst feature is that they break down and oxidize very fast. And a couple of researchers have looked for them in the blood at the time that they are having their anti inflammatory actions and found that they had already broken down, but just between the mouth and the bloodstream they broke down into completely new chemicals which were what accounted for their anti inflammatory effect. But those same breakdown products are what in the long run suppress the whole immune system and have a lot of other toxic effects. So the short range anti inflammatory effect I see as analogous to the anti inflammatory treatments I used to give with X ray or other radiation.

**Speaker D** (46:05): Yeah. What would some of those, the other effects, negative effects be other than?

**Speaker A** (46:15): Well, the whole immune system gets turned down so that it doesn't produce the inflammation that's bothering you. But in the long run that makes you susceptible to all kinds of infections. And I think in the long run it increases the risk of cancer and all of the age related degenerative processes.

**Speaker D** (46:44): Do you think, do you think it would be important to continue to monitor people, mothers, nurses, all of us who are using these omega supplements to see.

**Speaker A** (46:58): If we have a few people are doing that and warning about their increased use. It seems like a very bad idea to put it in powdered baby food because the time and oxygen exposure before it's eaten, it just does a terrific job of degrading those fats because they're so unstable.

**Speaker C** (47:30): Yeah.

**Speaker D** (47:33): What should we look for as a symptom that this is a problem? More infections, more colds?

**Speaker A** (47:43): Yeah. More infections would be the first thing. I've seen that in experimental animals and there have been some studies in people in which their immune systems were relatively inert against various organisms.

**Speaker B** (48:07): Oh, go ahead, ray.

**Speaker A** (48:09): With the anti inflammatory X ray treatments that they used in the 40s so enthusiastically it took from 10 to 15 years before they saw the harmful effects of them.

**Speaker D** (48:27): And can we, what can we do as consumers to alert or to get other doctors such as yourself to maybe conduct additional research that supports your Theories. I have called various manufacturers of the product and milk companies who are using the product and they assured me that everything was completely fine.

**Speaker A** (48:55): Yeah, it's the same with the additives. They're putting in so many products like the fumed silica, silicon dioxide that you see in vitamin pills and drugs and even foods, and titanium dioxide and so on. These things are proven risky at best. But you talk to the companies that use them and they don't want to think about it. They won't respond to sending them an article indicating that they somehow selectively misread the research incriminating material. It's hard to counter someone's occupational commitment to something that isn't helpful.

**Speaker B** (50:04): And Ray, maybe you can explain why it's come about that. I mean, I don't know if there's a short answer to this, but why it's come about that most of society in scientific culture is invested in these products that actually, although they might help inflammation in the short run, cause cancer in the long run. How did we get here?

**Speaker A** (50:30): The whole idea of science has been shaped by commerce and the military. The people who have something very powerful to gain from using science in a certain way supported being used that way. And the people who are trying to be objective don't have any ulterior motives and that means they don't have a source of funding.

**Speaker B** (51:05): Like there are minority views in science about issues like this, and my understanding is they just can't get published.

**Speaker A** (51:13): Oh yeah, and the. Have you looked at some of the controversies in other fields of science, such as Halton Arp and his quasar astronomy?

**Speaker B** (51:29): No.

**Speaker A** (51:32): He was successful in his career as long as he published his pictures in his Atlas of Odd Galaxies. As long as he just said, here's odd stuff I've been finding. But when he pointed out some very orderly things that related the redshift of quasars to the redshift of galaxies that they were clearly part of, they said, you can't use our telescopes anymore. Even though he was funded by taxpayers money, they wouldn't let him use the public telescopes.

**Speaker B** (52:20): I guess what I've become aware of during the show is that there are scientific dynasties, just like there are dynasties in other fields and commerce. And people get to the top of their career and obviously I think it's just human nature. They don't want to be. They feel like their own reputation and status is on the line if their theory ends up being proven not to be true.

**Speaker A** (52:47): Yeah, there's a little, maybe a one or two minute video on Bitten's of Paul to KNARP talking about his experiences and actually quotes some of the things that happened to him on his way out of the profession. Very ridiculous things that the top people in the field said and did.

**Speaker B** (53:16): Wow.

**Speaker D** (53:16): Well, this sounds like it would be ripe for the Science Channel to, to do a documentary on some of these contradictive things. But thank you very much. I'm going to hang up and listen to you guys on the air.

**Speaker B** (53:28): Okay, thanks for calling, Raj.

**Speaker D** (53:30): And I'm contemplating having dinner and then going to the bathroom after that.

**Speaker B** (53:36): Thank you for telling us.

**Speaker D** (53:40): Good night.

**Speaker B** (53:41): Good night, Raj. All right, the Phone line is open. 08:02-526-23268 02:52-626. Or if you have Skype on your computer, you can Skype John Barkhausen. All one word. Let's see. Have you ever seen the article Ray called? I think it's called against the Tide and it's about minority views in science and the experience of several scientists. We have another caller coming in. I'm going to take that. All right, you're on the air.

**Speaker E** (54:22): Hi, this is Justin. I was wondering if Ray could elaborate on any misconceptions he thought science might have in its view of the immune system.

**Speaker B** (54:34): All right, thanks. Justin. Let me just say before you start, Ray, I just got to say, this is WMRWLP Warren. Okay, sorry.

**Speaker A** (54:43): That was about the immune system.

**Speaker B** (54:45): Yeah, any. Justin, you still there?

**Speaker E** (54:49): Yes, I'm here.

**Speaker B** (54:49): Can you repeat that again?

**Speaker E** (54:53): Any misunderstandings you think science might have in the way it views the functions or the interactions of the immune system?

**Speaker A** (55:03): Yeah, I think the best answer to that is to look at the articles by Pauli Matzinger and Jamie Cunliffe or Cunliffe C U N L I F F E and Polly Matzinger. They, I think they are inspired by the. The thinking of Eli Metchnikov who was contemporary with Ehrlich, the magic bullet drug person. The German view of the immune system is the one that was profitable to the chemical drug industry. Looking for a magic bullet that would kill each kind of germ and then by extension applying it to the cancer, looking for chemicals that would kill cancer cells and not human non cancer cells. But Metchnikoff took a totally different approach to the immune system. The developmental, nutritional, morphogenic approach. And that didn't find any commercial sponsors. And it was the French Russian orientation that actually was the biological orientation rather than the industrial. And so the place where his ideas are well summed up the alternative idea of the immune system is.
