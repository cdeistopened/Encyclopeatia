---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy, and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, and biologist, Raymond Peat. In this hour-long episode, we'll talk about calcium as the cause and solution to many health problems, why an excess of phosphorus is a serious source of stress, libertarianism, the power elite's obsession with eugenics, and the prominent role of CIA fascist spymaster, Allen Dulles, in shaping the world we live in today.

## Calcium and the Work of Adele Davis

**Danny Roddy:** I’d like to read you this Adele Davis quote that you had in your calcium article as a starter. She says:

> "It is extremely important to realize that calcium deposits in soft tissues become worse when the diet is low in calcium. Persons suffering from arthritis, bursitis, scleroderma, hardening of the arteries, and any abnormality where calcium deposits or spurs may cause pain are often afraid to eat foods rich in calcium. Actually, they can never improve until their calcium and magnesium intakes are adequate."

That inspired my email to you about doing this episode on the idea that calcium is not only the solution to many health problems, but it's also the cause of many health problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and that was 50 years ago that she wrote that, at least. It's just horrifying to see how the medical journals now—at least 90% of the people talking about calcium—completely miss that information that she had back in 1960.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think that's possibly an extension of this incorrect view of the cell? Is that how they are getting it so wrong?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I don't think she knew anything about Gilbert Ling, but she did read that that's the difference. She was reading stuff in general and just accumulating information. That is what you have to conclude, even without knowing the principles of the gel nature of cytoplasm and how gels work—what pH does to a gel and its affinity for minerals. But that work had been going on for 20 or 30 years before Gilbert Ling wrote his stuff. It was in the culture and people were just staying awake, just like Adele Davis accumulated it by reading nutrition.

**Danny Roddy:** You frequently mention David McCarron and reference his articles from the late '80s and '90s. Was his work not respected or acknowledged?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He got fired from California University—I think UC Berkeley—and went to Oregon, where they were too backward to see how dangerous he was.

**Danny Roddy:** And the dangerous message was the calcium antihypertensive effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, stop talking about salt and giving people diuretics. The medical business had been killing them already for 30 years. When he said that it's calcium deficiency, not sodium excess, they had to fire him and send him to the backwoods.

## Cell Physiology: Polarization and ATP

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned the gel-like nature of the cell. Can I read you a little summary of the cell, and you can stop me if I'm horribly wrong?

If there's sufficient thyroid, ATP is the final end product of the food materials we consume. In the healthy resting state, ATP polarizes a cell, meaning that it sustains the protein-water-solute structure, preferentially absorbing potassium and magnesium and naturally excluding sodium and calcium. The depletion of ATP leads to the depolarized state where a cell is vulnerable. The depletion of ATP also breaks down into ADP, a lower energy molecule. You lose the complex of magnesium with ATP, and you also lose phosphate. Then the ADP complexes with calcium. This is the general state that leads to reductive stress, low carbon dioxide, high lactic acid, and the shift in the intracellular and extracellular pH.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And meanwhile, things are streaming—oxygen and sugar are streaming in, and CO2 is streaming out, dragging the unnecessary minerals with it.

**Danny Roddy:** The switch between the polarized and depolarized state—is that a natural phenomenon, or should a cell not necessarily need to shift into that disorderly, water-depolarized state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gilbert Ling showed that when he poisoned the energy-producing systems, glycolysis and oxidation, cells retained their polarization for longer than 24 hours, just sitting there essentially dead. Meanwhile, sodium and calcium were bouncing in the cell and bouncing right back out again. So they kept their polarization despite the motion across the surface and into the near regions of the cytoplasm.

**Danny Roddy:** I haven't looked at that paper for a long time. It was always semi-confusing because if he's doing a stress test or energy depletion of the cell, how is it not becoming depolarized?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He didn't excite them; he kept them quiet. They were reptile cells that could stand being cold, so he kept them cold so that there wasn't depletion of the energy. The energy just stayed there, stuck to the proteins.

## Carbon Dioxide and the Resting State

**Danny Roddy:** I had written to him a long time ago asking about carbon dioxide as a cardinal adsorbent. You see carbon dioxide as something essential for maintaining the resting living state or the polarized state.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I asked him something about carbon dioxide about 25 years ago, and he described an experiment he had done in graduate school that exactly answered my question. It explained what they call the lactate paradox of high altitude, where you can work full speed at high altitude without producing lactic acid the way you would at low altitude. He did it in the lab, basically showing that cells don't fully depolarize even when they're stimulated and working if they have a good supply of carbon dioxide. So in the lab, he showed the CO2 was preventing full depolarization, and that's why you see it at high altitude. You don't depolarize enough to shift from oxidation to lactic acid production.

**Danny Roddy:** I think somewhere you said that frequently depolarized cells can lead to this pathology of being killed in the process, or excitotoxicity and cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the cell depends on using its internal glycogen to get the sugar it needs to produce carbon dioxide. If that's depleted, then it starts using any amino acids or fatty acids to oxidize. They produce less carbon dioxide and will turn on the wasteful process of producing lactic acid, and that starts a vicious circle.

**Danny Roddy:** The fats producing less carbon dioxide is one of the aspects of that—the pyruvate decarboxylation—because that produces some CO2. Is it something about oxygen economy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the carbohydrates carry their own oxygen. Each carbon already has part of the carbon dioxide. With fat, you have to start with molecular oxygen. There's no oxygen built into the fat molecule. You use the oxygen to produce the carbon dioxide for each atom of carbon in the fat, whereas with carbohydrate, you use only half of the oxygen molecule because there's already one oxygen atom attached to the carbon.

## Magnesium and Phosphate

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to ask you a little bit about magnesium. Andrew Kim wrote: "Magnesium or potassium is needed to form the phosphorylated ATPase that then, upon exposure to calcium or sodium, transfers a phosphate group to ADP, generating ATP." So in short, magnesium helps to retain and generate ATP. You had called magnesium the basic protective calcium blocker.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And at the same time you're making ATP, you're subtracting some inorganic phosphate from that environment to get rid of its excitatory effect.

**Danny Roddy:** The breakdown of ATP can increase the intracellular phosphate, but is the same thing occurring when a person is just eating way more phosphate than sodium, magnesium, and calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Similar, it tends to push it in. Fructose has the property of lowering intracellular phosphate. The phosphatases are very cell-protective in general. Getting the proteins unphosphorylated puts them into the resting state. When you stick a phosphate onto a protein covalently, it tends to change its whole behavior. The whole cell goes into the excited state. But even before it gets attached enzymically, it's pulling the water system away from the resting state.

My interpretation of muscle contraction or nerve excitation isn't that there is some little motor that runs on the so-called "high energy bond." The way they usually picture it is that the energy from the so-called high energy bond goes into some kind of a motor. But one of my good professors, Sidney Bernhardt, showed in 1959 that there is no high energy bond in ATP. I asked, "Why does everyone talk about the high energy bond?" A famous guy from England had just been at the university that week. He never said very much, but he said, "Not everyone does."

**Danny Roddy:** Gilbert says it in his 2001 book. He says Scow presented his sodium pump hypothesis, and Podolsky and Morales demonstrated that the high energy phosphate bond concept was in serious trouble. But it's still common talk today, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, horrifyingly. It makes you miss the whole thing that's happening, which is that you don't want that free phosphate messing up your water system.

**Danny Roddy:** What is it doing to specifically de-energize the cell? You said it was excitotoxic. Is that increasing some messenger to de-energize the mitochondria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No messenger, just the whole system changes the way it's lined up. Like if you have a bunch of soldiers lined up in rows and then you say, "Give an order," and suddenly the whole thing melts and there's no longer any rows. That's sort of a whole phase transition happening. That's the problem with the receptor idea—that everything to some extent is a receptor. When you have a thousand different things getting ordered differently when it's in one state than in the other, the order that has been kept in the proper positions melts as a whole process, not as a series of isolated processes.

**Danny Roddy:** So you could call phosphate a depolarizer, basically, in excess?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Danny Roddy:** And then that would lead to the cell just having to make the choice of dying or being killed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, if it can't find its internal resources—ideally the glycogen and oxygen. If something cuts off its oxygen and glucose supply, then it starts eating itself and it's in danger of disintegrating. It can do that in more or less organized ways. If it's taken by surprise, it can dump its innards out in very distressing ways. But if it is gradual enough that it is deprived of energy, then it can get itself organized so that it makes its internal materials available to other parts of the organism.

So when you're exercising one set of muscles, if you go about it gradually, you can build those up and not subtract too much from the others because you're feeding what they need. But if you are very intense in your exercise, if it's stressful, then the cortisol gets the material by shutting off the oxygen/sugar use in idle cells, causing them to slowly release their material that can be used by the active cells to build them up. So stress hormones partly are there to prevent toxic death of cells—make it an orderly disintegration that can help the other parts of the organism.

## Stress, Culture, and Libertarianism

**Danny Roddy:** What you just said reminded me of a Selye quote where he was saying that everything is being affected equally, but there is a weakest link somewhere in there that can lead to some specific pathology.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's the working system. It's an adaptive process that feeds support into the system that's working and functioning. The idea of the functional system includes the way your brain is working too. Habits are sort of a functional system. You integrate your thoughts, digestive processes, and muscle activities around a way of living, and that supports that pattern. So you tend to get in a rut if you don't have things to interrupt and give you a more general way of functioning.

**Danny Roddy:** The brain is born into the culture, and then the culture lives in the nervous system. Maslow said something like the culture should be like an adaptive tool.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the social system should be intelligent basically, and then it wouldn't degrade the participants in it. But when the social system is designed unintelligently, it's participating in the degrading process. Maslow said it a lot more elegantly.

**Danny Roddy:** I always like reading your stuff, and I'll see something from Maslow or Rogers, and it will make me understand your work a little bit better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been reading *Freud and the Freudians* for six months when I found Maslow's book. It was a tremendous experience just the way he spoke.

**Danny Roddy:** Was he thought of as a crackpot at the time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, he was a great irritant to the Freudians who were still there, and the new behaviorists were coming on and they didn't think he was at all scientific.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you feel similarly about Rogers? I know you had a criticism about him.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, his approach was great for the union breakers. They immediately saw that. One of his collaborators on the book *The Sciences of Man*, his co-author said that his approach was good for the tobacco industry. So was Selye—Selye was a cigarette promoter. But Rogers, his first book, *Client-Centered Therapy*, the back part of it gives the philosophical basis. It's a very good description of phenomenology. It's philosophically very good, but it can be made bad use of by bad people.

**Danny Roddy:** So if I understand what you're saying, the bad part about it is not wanting to attack and criticize?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Maslow would just butt in and say, "You're feeling messed up because you're dealing with a horrible situation and just get out of that situation."

**Danny Roddy:** To play devil's advocate, somebody might be like, well, that's an authoritarian way of approaching things.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But a direct way of being anti-authoritarian can look authoritarian, but it isn't. And actually, the super anti-authoritarian Rogers followers end up leaving the authoritarians in place.

**Danny Roddy:** Well, that's kind of funny. I swear I'm not obsessed with libertarianism, but it seems like they say, "We're not authoritarian, so we're gonna get rid of the government and then break up into these small groups."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's the Koch brothers and their ilk. They pose as anti-authoritarians, libertarians, because they want to have absolute power. They really would like to own the government, but if people still insist on voting and things, then they want to break up the government entirely and then have their own governing system.

**Danny Roddy:** There was a website called Naked Capitalism, and they had a series of articles called "Journey into a Libertarian Future." The series was satirical, but they were using real quotes from a person named Hans-Hermann Hoppe. It was enlightening, not only because a lot of the libertarians I'm aware of seem to be genetic determinists, but the author also seemed to have a misanthropic contempt for humanity, using phrases like "natural authority" and favoring the elite.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you read any of Murray Bookchin's books or articles?

**Danny Roddy:** No.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He was a good libertarian compared to the Koch type.

**Danny Roddy:** You had mentioned Joe Raimondo, antiwar.com?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. Those are pretty good libertarians. They don't want to kill everyone. They consider themselves the archaic conservatives—the old-fashioned conservatives who actually believe in freedom rather than freedom to control everyone else.

**Danny Roddy:** Something else libertarians often talk about is the non-aggression principle. That might sound good at face value, but based on Hans Selye's or your work on stress, the non-aggression principle really doesn't make any sense when you stress a person to fight for their survival. If you have to provide for yourself or your family or you're going to die, who cares about the non-aggression principle?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there's the reality problem.

## Parathyroid Hormone, Serotonin, and CO2

**Danny Roddy:** Do you want to switch gears and talk about parathyroid hormone and serotonin? You're the only person I know of that makes the connection between the two. I know that low thyroid, hyperventilation, or too much estrogen tend to promote the loss of carbon dioxide. That causes the platelets carrying the serotonin—primarily produced in the intestine—to become leaky. The serotonin leaks out and activates the parathyroid glands.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the place that that should be normal is in lactation. The serotonin turns on prolactin, and the prolactin is parallel to the parathyroid hormone. Both of those break down the bone to provide extra calcium for lactation. So the serotonin works systematically in a logical way to make milk.

But when hypothyroidism is the reason for excess serotonin—hypothyroidism in itself, because you're not producing very much carbon dioxide by not using oxygen much—any little exertion tends to use up your energy and you have to then resort to glycolysis and produce the lactic acid and inflammatory state. Hypothyroid people run at a higher level of histamine, serotonin, and usually adrenaline too. Everything is using the emergency system unnecessarily. Just a background state of a very hypothyroid person is hyperventilating in the sense of running around with those processes turned on.

So when they go to a higher altitude and get even less oxygen and breathe faster, their hyperventilation becomes visible. But anyone, if they're driven to breathe faster than they should, if they use up their carbon dioxide—like an inflammation that produces lactic acid and serotonin—will turn on hyperventilation and stop the adequate production of carbon dioxide. And that sets in motion the things like causing the platelets to release more serotonin and the serotonin activating the prolactin and parathyroid hormone. It causes chronic breakdown of your bones.

**Danny Roddy:** You had said that in a Vernadskyian ideal state where the organism was realized in a really good environment, you would barely need your hormones. I was thinking about parathyroid hormone too simplistically as just being suppressed by calcium, potassium, magnesium, or sodium. But like you just said, the primary thing holding it down is carbon dioxide. So if the atmosphere just spontaneously increased in carbon dioxide, you would need less of your hormones because they're having this adaptive function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide is going to produce lots of sugary fruit and make the diet easier to keep the carbohydrate up, as well as the atmosphere keeping you from wasting your glucose.

## Climate Cycles and Carbon Dioxide

**Danny Roddy:** Is there much information on the Carboniferous period? That's when the Earth had an extremely high concentration of carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there are lots of coal deposits that show what was going on there.

**Danny Roddy:** Wasn't there a rapid evolutionary escalation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just a burst of innovation biologically.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that on a cycle? Could something like that be estimated to occur in the future?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are people working on the idea of cycles of the Earth more or less coordinated with cycles of the sun. There are different opinions about whether you can have an approximate idea of when that's going to happen. But the smaller cycles, the ice ages, are somewhat easier to see meaningful cycles in.

In 1940, the consensus was that a new ice age was approaching. The temperatures had been warming in the first part of the century, but it looked like they were now regressing. That opinion stuck around from 1940 when I was in high school. It was in the magazines. As recently as 1974 or '75, *Time* magazine and *New York Times* were talking about an oncoming ice age. But then Three Mile Island scared people about nuclear power. That scare scared the Pentagon that they would lose their nuclear fuel for making bombs. Almost immediately, they came out with a theory that carbon dioxide was going to create a too-hot planet. No more talk about the ice age that had been discussed for 35 years.

**Danny Roddy:** I've heard that before. Somebody was detailing the transition between the "oiligarchs"—Rockefeller Standard Oil—transitioning into the green movement. Those are all the same people saying don't have children and humans are cancer on this planet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, people are a cancer because now we have automation and don't need workers. The Rockefeller Foundation, starting in the early 1900s, was pioneering disease prevention because they needed healthy workers. Now that there's automation, it would be very economical to get rid of about four or five billion workers.

## Eugenics, Allen Dulles, and Political History

**Danny Roddy:** Upon watching that documentary, they were talking about Standard Oil producing mustard gas and then mustard gas being resynthesized into chemotherapy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, basically. One of my favorite examples of research financing was Elwood Jensen. He was a government-financed chemical warfare person working on things better than cyanide for killing people. The government transitioned him right into working on estrogen. Around that time, estrogen became a big government as well as industry topic, with cancer institutes taking up the study of estrogen.

Elwood Jensen invented the estrogen receptor. The government gave him the only radioactively labeled estrogen to do his research with. Using that, he said that there is no metabolism of estrogen by the uterus. So all you people studying enzymology to explain how estrogen works, you're wrong. It's just hitting the receptor, no metabolism. It turns on the genes and the genes turn on femaleness. Then 15 or 20 years later, other people had access to the various isotopes and could show, yes, the uterus does metabolize estrogen. But meanwhile, everyone had adopted the idea of a receptor turning on genes.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think Elwood Jensen's research was being guided by the hands of these eugenics fanatics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think the chemical warfare and estrogen Pentagon people are all clearly doing that. As a sidelight, they are seeing that inducing cancer almost instantly can be a useful tool for the military.

**Danny Roddy:** I might as well mention it, but it's James Corbett's *How Big Oil Conquered the World* and *Why Big Oil Conquered the World*. He documents how obsessed the elite people were with eugenics and how deep-rooted the class system of "useless eaters" is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the whole genetics movement itself—genetics, not eugenics—grew out of that motivation. The original famous geneticists were also eugenicists. After Hitler became a target of scorn, the eugenics journal changed its name to *Human Genetics*. Just after I got my PhD, I wrote an article in the graduate student newspaper and mentioned that fact—that the eugenics people were still around, still teaching genetics, but that they were embarrassed and mentioned the *Journal of Eugenics* in the library. That week, all of the old volumes disappeared.

**Danny Roddy:** Wasn't Hitler funded by one of the Dulles brothers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, they were his employees. But Standard Oil and several of the big banks—the Bush family and some of the big Democrats in the banks primarily—were financing the fascists right into and through the war. As the war was declared, Roosevelt's government declared that Allen Dulles was officially a German enemy agent temporarily. But very shortly after that, he was put into the secret service—the OSS—and then the CIA, and his brother put into the State Department.

If you look at the whole history of how those corporate powers were treating Roosevelt: in 1933, they had organized a coup and recruited a Marine Corps General, Smedley Butler, to lead the army into Washington to put him out of office. Butler gathered information as they were communicating between the corporations and took the information to Congress. Congress investigated and confirmed what he said, but then did nothing.

After 12 more years, they were influential in putting Truman in as vice president in place of Henry Wallace, because Wallace had gone on record as favoring a continuation of Roosevelt's anti-war policies. Allen Dulles was, meanwhile, in charge of European negotiations. Just a week or two before Roosevelt's death, Allen Dulles was secretly—and against instructions agreed upon by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin—making deals with the Nazis to have the Nazis not fight the Americans and to go fight the Russians. Truman heard about it and said, "That information must be false because no one would do that." Stalin heard about it first, and that was how Roosevelt heard about it. Then, within a few days, Roosevelt conveniently died before he had to accuse Dulles of the treason he was involved in. Allen Dulles then made deals with the German intelligence apparatus and unified the US intelligence system with the Nazi system, and that's what has set the course of history.

**Danny Roddy:** I guess there was a story about Allen Dulles's son, who was having some psychotic problem, and he would say things like, "My dad is a Nazi spy." The author said he never said that again after they gave him his anti-psychotic medication.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably hurt so much.

**Danny Roddy:** But the person that possibly had poisoned Roosevelt was the painter woman. Do you have any perspective on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah, there was talk about the inhalant that he used while he was being painted. Just putting a little too much Benzedrine or something in the inhalant. He sniffed it, held his head, and had an excruciating pain in his head after sniffing his inhalant, and then that inhalant disappeared.

**Danny Roddy:** I had never heard that connection between Dulles and Roosevelt. He's very implicated in two high-profile presidential assassinations.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. Have you heard any of the connections of Lee Harvey Oswald's landlady and George de Mohrenschildt? Lee Harvey Oswald's landlady was working with de Mohrenschildt, who was a 35-year associate of Dulles. They were both helping Lee Harvey Oswald get jobs, like in the convenient book building in Dallas, and his landlady was a very close family friend of the Dulles'. Both of the people managing his movements for the last few months of his life were close longtime associates of Allen Dulles.

**Danny Roddy:** When you're going through life and hearing these things, are you just wondering what's really going on? When you're hearing that Kennedy was assassinated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, my first thought was that Kennedy was such a bad man, no wonder. But then, immediately within a week or so, I realized it was a coup for putting an even worse man in office.

**Danny Roddy:** And something Webster Tarpley said is that we don't know who the new Allen Dulles is right now, but he certainly set a precedent of things to come which are still unraveling right now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, Allen Dulles started associating with that banker/politician crowd when he was about 10 years old. So he had real skill and background in how to maneuver through the political criminal world. I don't think there's anyone with such an extreme international social background operating. So I think there are basically a lot of klutzes.

## Supplements, Hormones, and Progesterone

**Danny Roddy:** I only have a single other question to ask you. It seems like occasionally you've mentioned that pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and/or thyroid aren't as effective if Vitamin D and/or calcium are low. My question was, I know that PTH can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, but is it such a powerful brake on the metabolism that getting the Vitamin D and the calcium or carbon dioxide in order would just be important for having these other things work effectively?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to include sodium and a lot of other things in there, but yeah, it's one of the adequate brakes on the system.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that because of the specific actions of parathyroid hormone, or is it because it causes mast cells to release serotonin and other things like that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's part of a system, so in itself is very powerful. The Vitamin D and calcium are working on other things too, so you can't say that they're only working on the parathyroid hormone. They work on the serotonin and prolactin and growth hormone, essentially everything in themselves to different degrees.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you want to touch on progesterone real quick? I know that just online there was a general confusion where people were misconstruing things about progesterone that you might wanna clear up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. People have been saying completely imaginary things. I imagine someone wanting to sell a product other than Progest-E complex must have made them up because they have no connection to reality. I had nothing to do with the Progest-E formula. It's exactly the formula that I developed in 1976 and has been exactly the same thing all these years. But people have been saying that they added estrogenic substances to it. A lot of people saying that they get estrogen symptoms. It is the usual internet negative placebo suggestibility. But the story that the formula has changed seems to have been repeatedly promoted on some of the internet discussion places.

**Danny Roddy:** Lastly, can we just touch on why somebody might have a strange reaction to progesterone? Like you mentioned that when estrogen is being eliminated, it can pass through an inflamed tissue and then the tissue can contain large amounts of beta-glucuronidase, and that will remove the glucuronic acid leaving pure estrogen to accumulate in the tissues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Except that when you're talking about a whole system, the progesterone is also protecting against the inflamed system with its beta-glucuronidase. So it's tending to stop that process too. So the more you take, basically the more stable everything is. It inhibits the glucuronidase and the sulfatase which reactivate estrogen, and it activates the transferases of sulfate and glucuronide to inactivate estrogen. And it has a similarly organized effect on the various dehydrogenases that reduce the activity of estradiol. Everything progesterone does in reference to estrogen—there are at least 11 things that I've counted—is consistently anti-estrogenic.

So I think it's all a suggestibility. One of the first times I experienced that was a pregnant woman said progesterone was having some strange effect. I asked her how much she had taken. She said she put it on her wrist, a dime-sized area. She had heard about transdermal use of scopolamine for travel sickness and was putting one drop in one spot and thinking it should have an effect. If you take a minuscule amount and then look at your symptoms, you're bound to notice some symptom that has nothing to do with the microscopic amount you've absorbed.

**Danny Roddy:** So besides not taking enough, I think you've also mentioned things like thyroid function being too low and/or Vitamin D deficiency could cause those symptoms—not necessarily because of the progesterone, but because of these other inflammatory aspects that the person is already dealing with.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, one person said she had no effect from taking 100 milligrams—a fourth of a teaspoon of the Progest-E—and I asked her to repeat the dose. She took as much as 400 milligrams and still didn't feel anything. When she had her blood tested, her estrogen was the highest I've ever seen. It was 100 times higher than the estrogen should have been. When your estrogen reaches a certain point, there's no absorptive capacity, no carrying capacity into the blood that can carry enough progesterone to have an effect. For those people, it's necessary to work on the liver, feeding the liver protein or B vitamins—whatever it needs to start detoxifying the estrogen—and increase the thyroid if necessary to make the liver metabolize the estrogen.

**Danny Roddy:** Similarly, I remember you saying that if you were drinking milk or orange juice, that it could cause bloating. You said that sometimes when you drink liquids, it makes inflammation in the intestine more noticeable. I thought that was really profound.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and the word bloat has various meanings. Some people who have one or two ounces of liquid around their intestines—verified by ultrasound—just a small amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity can create a sensation of fullness. Some people refer to that as bloat. But when it's digestive, if you aren't digesting your carbohydrate, the bacteria can produce a large amount of gas. The test for that is just to thump your belly with your fingers. You can tap it in different places and find exactly where there's a gas deposit if there is.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** I think that's all the questions I have for you. What are you working on right now, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cholesterol and then progesterone will be my next newsletters. Thinking about the evolutionary, in every sense, implications and meaning of cholesterol and progesterone.

**Danny Roddy:** Awesome, you have been so generous with your time. My sincere thanks. Thank you so much, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.
