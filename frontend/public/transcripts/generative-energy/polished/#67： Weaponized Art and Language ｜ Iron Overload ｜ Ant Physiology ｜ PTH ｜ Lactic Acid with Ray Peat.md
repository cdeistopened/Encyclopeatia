---# Introduction: The CIA, Art, and Linguistics

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, hello everybody. Welcome to the show. I just interrupted Ray, and he was talking about the CIA and art. Ray, go ahead and reiterate whatever you were going to say before I interrupted you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just that the traditions in painting had accumulated lots of knowledge from the time of Michelangelo and the older classical paintings. They had been learning actual physical principles about light and geometry, teaching their art students an aspect of physics to use in representing the world.

Then, with the First World War, the Dada surrealist reaction and Freudianism rejected the whole so-called rational system that created such terrible things as the World War. That went with a lot of experimentation in the arts, sciences, and humanities. Hitler closed all of the experimental art schools and dissenting science programs.

Right during and after the Second World War, the CIA created the Congress for Cultural Freedom, in which they imposed that revolutionary attitude towards painting—destroying the old because of its connection to the corrupt system. But they put it out as the glory of Western culture and freedom. Siqueiros, the Mexican painter, called it "ghost art" imposed by the Rockefellers to destroy consciousness. Abstract expressionism, for example.

The activities of the CIA, through the Cultural Freedom Foundation, shamed and expelled the traditional people from the universities who preserved the great tradition in painting. A whole generation of painters in the universities didn't learn how to paint at all. We are just now beginning to come out of that phase where the whole culture was deliberately being destroyed and rerouted down the Rockefeller "ghost art" route to destroy actual understanding.

I see Noam Chomsky's linguistics as being one of the most powerful examples of that. Real linguistics had developed with Franz Boas and his students. They had created descriptions and an understanding of a great variety of language and culture. A peak idea was the Whorfian hypothesis, showing the absolute interaction between conceptual understanding of the world and how the language is structured. That was a way of understanding the role of language behind science, art, and culture—the way that language can propagandistically destroy understanding of reality.

At MIT, with Pentagon funding, the trend under Noam Chomsky was to throw out everything that was real in the linguistics tradition and substitute mysticism-based views of consciousness in which words are essentially determined by genes. Many historians of language have looked back and pointed out that his so-called "generative grammar" couldn't generate anything and wasn't a grammar. It was a total fraud. But high school textbooks incorporated his ideas. Supposedly, since it described language production in terms of a language apparatus which is genetically determined, learning his linguistics would make it easier to understand English. They sold those books to school boards across the country. It was absolutely destructive, destroying a consciousness of how language really works. When he got famous for his anti-imperialism, the world politely forgot how fraudulent his linguistics work had been.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you suspect he was working under the direction of anybody specific?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think he was one of the originators. Having grown up studying mysticism, it blended right into that mystical idea that there is no consciousness other than words. In a fairly recent video, he was explaining that animals can't think because they don't have words. But he spelled out the word "dog" because he didn't want to get the dogs excited. So he was saying dogs don't have consciousness because they don't have words, but then he had to spell out the word because they understood it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Weren't the experiments in North Carolina with deaf and mute people relevant here? The state thought they were complete cretins that had no consciousness, no feelings, no mind, and they actually forcibly sterilized them. Later on, somebody did IQ tests on those people and it turned out that they were perfectly intelligent. Doesn't that invalidate Chomsky's theory directly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly.

**Georgi Dinkov:** These people had no language. They were born deaf and mute. All they had was visual and tactile perception. When a psychiatrist did IQ tests on them, it turned out that most of them had normal intelligence. So it's difficult to argue that Chomsky was right because this directly proves that even in humans, people with no language are perfectly capable of conscious experience.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, everything in reality falsifies Chomsky.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why is this guy still a tenured professor at MIT then? Is it just inertia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At the same time he was creating his anti-science doctrine of generative grammar, one of his students said that even though the press was saying Chomsky has explained how the brain creates language, he in person said that when he says "generate," he means it in a mathematical sense of "account for." He knew that people were being misled.

At the same time, Norbert Wiener, with his more holistic approach to cybernetics—a non-digital, analog approach—was present at MIT. But because he criticized war and wouldn't take money from the Pentagon, he was ostracized. Chomsky was glad to receive funding from the Pentagon. He was a supporter of a Pentagon rocket man to be the chancellor of MIT. He was, in a way, the Pentagon's pet anti-imperialist.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Chomsky used to be a close associate of Marvin Minsky, one of the creators of the AI movement. I think Minsky greatly disagreed with Chomsky's theory that language is genetically determined because Minsky said, "If that's the case, we should have been able by now to create an algorithm that would allow a computer to generate and learn a language de novo." And we miserably failed every time we tried.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When I was teaching linguistics, nationally known linguists would come to my class to talk, and I would have a chance to explain what was wrong with Chomsky's thing. I pointed out that you can create a sentence using his rules only if you know what the sentence is you want to produce to know what series of rules to choose. You can't make a sentence that you don't know already by applying his rules.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of your articles, you said that the real structure of language is based on images. So language comes after perception. If language is based on images, is the fundamental structure of language based in physical brain structure, which always changes with time and experience?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the brain structure is formed by interaction with the world.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So in other words, metabolic rate, which greatly influences changes in brain structure, may be the ultimate determinant in the evolution of language.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Someone looked at letters that nuns had written in their 20s. Those who developed Alzheimer's at a relatively young age showed a simplified language structure in their 20s. At a young age with a lot of mental energy, the language structure is extremely complex and unique. Every situation demands a fundamental rethinking of the whole thing. When the mental energy is lower, what you get is strings of cliches.

## Ray Peat's Newsletter: Estrogen, Iron, and Aging

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to chat about Ray's newsletter: *Estrogen, Iron, Degenerative Aging, and Progesterone*. It is amazing that you're still synthesizing these new ideas every two months. What was your motivation behind writing it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just noticing that people weren't putting two and two together over the years. Stuff that people could have been actually doing serious work on 50 years ago. No one really has the motivation or energy to draw the conclusions.

**Danny Roddy:** What are the huge misconceptions that you feel like this newsletter covered?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That working on one part of it, like taking an aromatase inhibitor, isn't going to solve very much. At the same time, improving one thing is likely to be making something else worse. You have to look at the whole process as far as you can and think of how you can remedy things with the least risk of doing more damage.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question on one of the main themes, which says that osteoporosis and dementia are associated with iron overload, but they're also associated with an increased likelihood of anemia. What would be your understanding of anemia? Just low ferritin and low iron saturation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, anemia is low blood, low hematopoietin, low hemoglobin. About 50 years ago, someone was studying the health of California migrant workers and found that the kids running around somewhat hungry and dirty were healthier than the local middle-class Anglo kids. One of the features of the very poor immigrant kids was a hemoglobin of 10 or 10.5. It isn't just malaria in Africa that flares up and kills people when they give them an iron supplement; right in the U.S., they can see that so-called anemic kids are healthier than the ones with the so-called normal levels.

**Danny Roddy:** So by iron overload, you mean the accumulation of unusable iron in the forms of lipofuscin and other iron complexes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Estrogen is one of the things that causes you to retain iron but protectively lowers your hemoglobin and hematocrit. For 100 years, doctors have looked at women with very low hematocrit or hemoglobin and prescribed iron pills, keeping prescribing it even if their hemoglobin got lower, not understanding that the same thing that makes them overload on iron is blocking their bone marrow formation of red blood cells.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the well-known effects of increasing hematocrit and hemoglobin under the effect of androgens—is that due to the opposition of androgens to estrogen or a direct effect of androgens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both. Direct on the bone marrow in particular. Androgen stabilizes it and helps it get warmer and more productive. Estrogen tends to lower the temperature, and that goes with a tendency to inflammation and iron toxicity.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen those studies that claim that the purpose of fever is to deplete serum iron and tryptophan, which helps greatly in fighting off an infection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and it reduces all sorts of cytokines. Chilling creates inflammation, secreting inflammatory cytokines, and causes cells to take up water. The falling temperature is one of the mechanisms by which estrogen changes the body physiology.

## Calcium, Parathyroid Hormone, and CO2

**Danny Roddy:** Can you run through the calcium metabolism and how that leads to the accumulation of iron? What does parathyroid hormone (PTH) have to do with iron overload?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Under stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, that system activates the parathyroid hormone. Serotonin, which is pro-inflammatory, activates the parathyroid to provide more calcium to the bloodstream by taking it out of the bone.

The way it takes it out of the bone is to suppress the formation of carbon dioxide, because carbon dioxide helps the present calcium to crystallize into the bone as calcium carbonate. When the CO2 production is lowered, it's replaced by glycolytic production of lactic acid, and the lactic acid itself helps to dissolve the bone.

In all the rest of your tissues, including the cells in your bone making the lactic acid, the intracellular processes suffer. When they shift from producing carbon dioxide to producing lactate, the intracellular pH rises, increasing the negative ionization of the cell proteins, increasing their affinity for metals with a positive charge. Ionized calcium, iron, aluminum, lead—any other metal that is present will be stuck inside your soft tissue cells along with the calcium.

So the more calcium deficient you are, the more parathyroid hormone you make, and the more other metals will be present to crystallize, poisoning your blood vessels, brain cells, and kidney cells.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In Gilbert Ling's theory, potassium has the highest affinity for the intracellular proteins. How are these other metals able to displace potassium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The carbon dioxide causes an affinity for electrons as an acidic Lewis acid molecule. As it associates with the proteins, the electrons are retracted, making the electron cloud holding the potassium experience a lower attractive concentration of electrons. Since the water polarization of the big potassium atom doesn't interfere with that lower electronic attractive field, the potassium is strongly attracted even to an electron-retracted protein.

But as the carbon dioxide is decreased and the pH rises under the influence of forming lactic acid, then the electron cloud on the protein is no longer retracted towards the CO2. It forms a more intense concentration of negative charge, which will overcome the highly polarized water layers around sodium, but also around other highly concentrated positive charges. Once the sodium starts displacing the potassium, then the calcium, lead, mercury, and iron will have a chance to get in.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So you're saying that during the elevation of lactic acid production, intracellular pH rises because the cell quickly expels the lactic acid it produces?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but the lactic acid quickly moves out of the cell and acidifies the environment, creating other problems. But what happens inside when the lactic acid leaves is an increased pH because of the way the NADH handles its protons.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does lactic acid increase the reactivity of iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CO2 is known to have an inactivating effect on iron, helping to keep it in a relatively oxidized state because of that acid property of CO2. By displacing CO2, lactic acid is likely to make iron more reactive. When you reduce the triply ionized ferric iron, you get the highly reactive ferrous iron. So the reducing property of lactic acid is for sure going to create iron damage.

**Georgi Dinkov:** And in that case, the reactive oxygen species are also a problem because they also have this reductive effect, right? So keeping the metabolic rate high and preventing the leakage of these reactive oxygen species is another thing that will limit the activation of iron.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's a whole flowing system that changes the nature of the cytoplasmic substance.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What is the direct conductor of this whole process? It seems that the direct agent is carbon dioxide, but the thyroid is just the cause of the creation of carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, this CO2 is the most pervasive, powerful, and immediate causer. It simultaneously goes with your consciousness, your level of motivation, and sensitivity. All of the life properties correspond to basically the level of CO2 in your tissue.

**Danny Roddy:** In your estimation, is parathyroid hormone one of the strongest stimulators of lactic acid production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, as I presently understand it.

**Danny Roddy:** I was talking to Kate Deering, and it seemed like estrogen, prolactin, aldosterone, serotonin—every single thing increases parathyroid. It seemed like that was the final common path of stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the angiotensin system is very close to it, but I think that's the right way of seeing it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But the reverse is also true, isn't it? Parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of all of these other mitigators as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because it creates the degenerative alarm condition, and the short-term recuperative stress hormones all exacerbate the long-range degenerative processes.

**Danny Roddy:** What increases cellular uptake of parathyroid hormone, and conversely, what inhibits it? Is there a way to make the cell more resistant to parathyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nothing that I know of.

**Danny Roddy:** Wow. So really the only way to protect is limit its synthesis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium are the things that are best known to do that. But at the same time, reducing angiotensin, serotonin, and aldosterone.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, apparently parathyroid hormone is harder to suppress as you get older or sicker.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it does increase with age. One of the interesting things is that the bone with aging and osteoporosis forms lots of aromatase. It becomes a powerful source of estrogen at the same time that it's degenerating.

**Danny Roddy:** And that would be ameliorated by what? Just decreasing the activity of the parathyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Getting your calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium high enough that you turn off your parathyroid hormone. That's necessarily going to reduce the local stress and all of the signals that increase aromatase.

## Progesterone and Bone Health

**Danny Roddy:** How does progesterone relate to parathyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It strengthens your bones and turns off aromatase. Once you recognize that stressed bones produce estrogen by their local aromatase, then you see one of the reasons that progesterone is going to strengthen the bones—because it inhibits aromatase and knocks out the estrogen receptors.

**Danny Roddy:** In addition to good nutrition, calcium, and vitamin D, progesterone, thyroid, and vitamin K would be good things for osteoporosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, everything good helps your bones.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of your newsletters, you said that serotonin antagonists are highly anabolic for the bone. I've seen studies with drugs like ondansetron, which is a serotonin antagonist, showing they work on osteoclasts and osteoblasts without necessarily affecting parathyroid hormones. It seems like serotonin has a direct effect on bone health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think everything really is overlapping. The receptor idea is just a way of trying to introduce order kind of artificially.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Another question on progesterone. In one of your articles, you mentioned that high enough concentrations of progesterone can actually make the so-called estrogen receptor protein completely disintegrate. Does progesterone have the same sort of disintegrating effect on aromatase too, or is it simply inhibiting its effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's just blocking the promotion. For example, one of the powerful promoters of aromatase is prostaglandin E. The enzyme cyclooxygenase that makes prostaglandin is activated under almost exactly the same circumstances that activate aromatase. Progesterone is known to, in multiple overlapping ways, block the formation of prostaglandin E.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is the main mechanism behind the synthesis of the actual aromatase protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Radiation, hypoxia, vitamin E deficiency, progesterone deficiency—all of these have been known to activate the formation of more aromatase. Each one of those factors is also activating many other parts of the cell. It's like a holistic switch mechanism in which everything gathers up a summation of forces to either turn aromatase on or off.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does the entry of steroids into the cell depend on the steroid structure and the lipophilic or hydrophilic status of the cell? For example, cortisol and estrogen are much more hydrophilic than pregnenolone or progesterone. So if the cell is composed of fully saturated fats and is highly lipophilic, would that decrease the amount of hydrophilic steroids from entering?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because at the same time it's keeping the energy state of the cell up, which maintains the hydrophobic condition. The stabilizing of the hydrophobicity is also the stabilizing of the energy level, and that suppresses all of the things that would call for raising the amount of estrogen or cortisol.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So a very well-energized, highly lipophilic cell would be resistant to estrogen even though it may be expressing the estrogen receptor at a normal level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and it's probably keeping the estrogen receptors on the verge of disintegration to keep the hydrophobicity high.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that may account for some studies that show that if you drastically increase the intake of saturated fat, it shows an increase of estradiol in the urine? Would that be simply because the body is excreting all of this estradiol that cannot be used?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. A group led by Pasqualini has identified the processes of increasing estrogen in the cell or decreasing it. In about 10 different ways, progesterone's effect is to get estrogen out of the cell and inactivated—made water soluble so that it travels through the blood quickly and is excreted. So the deficiency of progesterone will leave your cells highly activated by estrogen.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Since the main method of deactivating estrogen is the glucuronidation process and sulfation, would you say that the presence of sufficient glucose in the diet is vital for the proper excretion of estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. The glucuronic acid is related to the vitamin C producing system and that requires the normal flow of carbohydrate through the system.

## Lipofuscin and Electron Transport

**Danny Roddy:** I have a question about lipofuscin. What is the mechanism through which lipofuscin inhibits the electron transport chain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My basic idea is that it's consuming the oxygen and the electrons that should be available to the mitochondria, and it's directly turning them into hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and water.

**Danny Roddy:** But in order for that process to happen, basically the accumulation of reactive oxygen species needs to occur, which suggests that a block of oxidative phosphorylation is already happening, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but it's like an amplifier. Once the process starts, you're making more heme oxygenase, releasing more iron, getting a more reduced environment that makes the iron more toxic, and consuming oxygen, lowering oxygen tension, accelerating the process. Once a person in old age reaches a point where they're visibly developing massive accumulation of dark pigment, it is extremely quick that they will go on to die.

## Current Events: The "Apocalypse"

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, we joked earlier about the "apocalypse in Oregon." Instead of just going through the news, can you summarize what's going on? Is this the capitalist class winning over the working class?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ruling class knows very well how to herd people, scare them with something, get a lemming conformist trend going, and inform them that everyone is going to do it and you'll be a freak if you don't go along. I think they're even inflating the number of people who are really getting the vaccines. The propaganda has reached a point that it is triggering the irritation and self-defense reflex in more and more people. As they start communicating and finding ways around the censorship, that frightens the ruling class more, so they panic and get more absurd in the lies they're putting out.

**Danny Roddy:** People with two vaccines becoming suddenly "un-vaxxed" because they don't have a third one should shake anybody to their core.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, three vaccines in a year, and that's not counting the influenza, shingles, and chickenpox vaccines. They haven't revised anything, so it says now adults are going to need multiple annual vaccinations. Even though the information has been coming out for several years that the influenza vaccine makes you several times more likely than the unvaccinated to develop a respiratory pneumonia-like problem.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I don't know if you checked out that document I sent you, but there were two tweets: one from Marx in 1842 and another from Ivan Illich in 1976. It seems like people were sounding the alarm on the possibility of a medical dictatorship.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. Illich saw education and medicine as the two basic evils of our society that were destroying humanity.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about technology? The Unabomber thought technology is at the core.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, yeah, the way technology is used in indoctrination. The existence of the technical knowledge itself needn't be harmful, but they create this ideology of the digital view of consciousness. If Norbert Wiener had been followed, there wouldn't have been this digitized reality—quantization of everything as part of the philosophical reductionism.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, by the second, third, and impending fourth vaccine, would there be something a person could measure on a lab test?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. I think the D-dimer would be pretty high.

**Georgi Dinkov:** China is embarking on a massive vaccination campaign to vaccinate 1.1 billion people by October 1st. What do you think is behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think China keeps in mind the history of germ warfare of the United States, and that's probably part of their thinking. But they also collaborated with the United States in that Wuhan Institute of Virology on this gain-of-function research. I think it's a faction in China. I think the president intervened and sort of cut down the Fauci faction.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there anything you want to say about Afghanistan or the so-called FDA approval of the vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there was a possible positive interpretation for Biden wanting to do what Trump wanted to do—get the army out of some of the wars. I think today's bombing probably was the factions that can't afford to have any decrease in war expenditure. The trillions that have gone through the military industry in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan—they don't want to see the tap turned off to their endless money supply.

## Nature, Animals, and Ants

**Danny Roddy:** Ray has previously mentioned that his favorite animals are ants. Are there any animals that Ray considers to be evil or malevolent, such as mosquitoes or hyenas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think so. It's just what they interpret as food that isn't compatible with our well-being. It's a matter of perspective. Mosquitoes and hyenas see lunch when they smell a person.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have any favorite examples of mutual aid in the animal kingdom?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, there are so many of them. You can see a lot of videos on the internet of animals expressing grief, gratitude, and mutual support. I watched one where a bird had fallen into a tar pit, and a tiger went over to it, grabbed onto its wing, and swung it out of the tar pit.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There are videos where a herd of buffaloes saves an antelope that a lion has latched onto. The buffaloes will go in and kick the lion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, actually animals show gratitude and friendship.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think ants communicate strictly through chemical messengers, or do you think they can do electromagnetic things too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I told a story about an ant drowning in honey. Another ant came along, saw the head sticking out, jumped back in shock, and then discussed the situation for a while—very agitated communications. Then it went around to the side and started eating. Another ant came along, did exactly the same thing—jumped back in shock—except this time the communication was very short, and it went around and started eating. They were obviously doing some kind of sign and touch language. It's obviously a very efficient language that can take a totally novel situation and size up the nature of the problem.

**Danny Roddy:** What is so special about ants? Why are they so amazing to you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At a relatively low body temperature, they can be so quick-witted. As they get very cold, they slow down. But they think and calculate with amazing efficiency. Basically as smart as anyone.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think them living in those burrows, they're exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so, yeah.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you seen the studies showing that ants don't age?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That would be the outcome of living in a high CO2 environment, I think.

## Listener Questions

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi and I were talking about collecting urine and each liter being about a thousand calories. Can you explain that test?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you measure your total water intake and urine, then you know how much water you're evaporating. That goes up as you burn calories. You basically perspire about a liter of water for every thousand calories burned.

**Danny Roddy:** I have a quote from you in 2012: "When it's taken in small doses, 50 micrograms of T3 will usually normalize any hypothyroid metabolism." Do you still feel similarly about that upper cap?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's just the equivalent of the old standard two grains of Armour Thyroid. It's partly just an arbitrary number because it varies so much with individuals. But roughly 25 micrograms of T3 sums up about the same as one grain of Armour.

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asked about your upbeat view of Mexico.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The objective evidence is that about 20 years ago, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas really won the popular vote but lost the election by fraud. The fact that in actual votes, as well as electoral success, AMLO had national support shows a lot about the quality of the country. It is very different from European-American consciousness.

**Danny Roddy:** What advice can Dr. Peat give regarding the best way to treat romantic grief, i.e., a broken heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Find a substitute or replacement. It works.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you ask Dr. Peat to expand on his views of ontology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ontologists have usually been confused, getting mental processes confused with thinking about the nature of reality itself. The idea of continuity and of interaction constantly—everything is impressing its aspects on everything else. So the nature of being is constantly changing as the world evolves. The substance itself is changing in the ontological sense, the same way a cell changes with experience.

**Danny Roddy:** Did you know William James had a concept about stress called "reservoirs of power"? He suggested that in every person there are reservoirs of power not ordinarily called upon.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There are documented cases where mothers are capable of lifting cars to save a child. What is the mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A very good coordination of the chemistry and the nervous innervation strengthens the fascia and muscles in a physical way that makes the parts stronger to meet the needs of the moment. I think it involves things like getting up your pregnenolone basic level and DHEA that strengthens the substance at all levels.

**Danny Roddy:** A listener wonders if you could recommend a safe and pro-thyroid way of oil painting.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I try not to use my fingers too much. That's not a good idea generally. And have very good ventilation.

**Danny Roddy:** Could Ray describe what a typical day of eating looks like for him?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very random in a sense, because I got tired of doing it one way and so innovate constantly. The common themes are milk, orange juice, eggs, cheeses, occasional cheese tacos, various soups, and so on.

**Danny Roddy:** Any final words, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keep learning about the virus. It's currently the most important thing about the reasons for the great dangers of the vaccines.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that the powers that be are winning? I can see it going both ways. The United States is not really in a financial position right now to endlessly pay people to do nothing and become dependent simply because it's in such massive amounts of debt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The people getting conscious is the essential thing, and it has to advance at a faster rate to prevent the death of the whole system.
