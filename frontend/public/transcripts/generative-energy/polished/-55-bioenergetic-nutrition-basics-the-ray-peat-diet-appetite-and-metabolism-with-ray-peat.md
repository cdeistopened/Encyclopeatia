## Climate, Metabolism, and Migration

**Danny Roddy:** I was asking Ray about Florida and Texas. Maybe we can start there and then go into the question Georgi just asked, because I think all this stuff is super important. Ray, what is your take on Florida and Texas being these places in the U.S. that are backing down from the COVID hysteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's great. Texas has lots of places with really good climate up in the hills. It's a higher altitude and very livable. I don't know any place in Florida that I would consider livable because of the humidity and heat.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think humans are just not designed to live in a climate like that? What's the exact problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to turn down your metabolic rate tremendously because of the high temperature and humidity.

**Danny Roddy:** Does that mean that people with low metabolism would feel better if they moved to Florida?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Super hypothyroid people just love it. It's making up entirely for their cold metabolism.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that one reason why all the retirees are moving to those places?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Danny Roddy:** So if you have a naturally high rate of metabolism, going to Florida would be problematic because that would be too high?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of the things that happened to me—even though I adjusted my heat production somewhat downward—the humidity and my high metabolism caused me to grow molds, like a fungus sprouting out of me. When I got back to Oregon under moderate temperature and humidity, they shriveled and fell off.

## Geopolitics and Current Events

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi, what was your question?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Based on what I've seen, even over mainstream media, it looks like even in the bastions of COVID hysteria, the measures are kind of falling apart. The population is not buying it. Even CNN ran an article that there is now a plateau of vaccination. About 38% have been vaccinated, and now there are huge surpluses of vaccines left unused because apparently the other 60% just don't want to be vaccinated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's a very natural, sane reaction. The climate change doctrine was promoting change gradually; it had a time frame of something like 10 or 20 years. They jumped on the pandemic idea and realized that the time frame for complete takeover would be reduced to two or three years. But with resistance, there's talk that they're going to have a so-called cyber attack justifying takeover by the governments of the banks—to save everyone's money by confiscating it, basically, and turning to a cyber currency and rationing out your own money to you.

**Danny Roddy:** Jake, Anika, and I were theorizing about when something like that would happen. James Corbett just released a video saying that would be an ideal situation to transition to the new digital currency. If you listen to them right now, aren't they saying that the digital currency is maybe a few years away? Would you expect a cyber attack later rather than sooner?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it depends on how sane the population is. If half the population gets fully aware of the horrors planned for them, then the ruling class is going to have to do something desperate like war or confiscation of the banks. I'm betting on war. I think that it's their favorite tool to start with. They're the most experienced with it. If they start a major war, like with Iran or, God forbid, China or Russia, even the sane population will be forced to get on board and support it because it'll be a matter of survival.

**Danny Roddy:** I have that article I sent to you, Ray, called "Flashpoint Ukraine: Don't Poke the Bear." Can you explain that? War keeps the capitalist machine going, but if they want to do societal change, what's the benefit of starting war with Russia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Their goal is to have Russia and China completely subdued because Russia has such a tremendous area of natural resources. Everyone wants to control their resources. The Russian government has been a nuisance for hundreds of years, and the West is still trying to think of ways to take total control. Meanwhile, keeping a mild war hysteria going is necessary to keep Western Europe and American economies running.

**Danny Roddy:** What are they trying to do right now? Make Russia go to war with the Ukraine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're hoping that Putin will just give up if England and the U.S. give the impression that they will totally back whatever the Ukraine does. Turkey is getting into it, training Ukrainian soldiers and urging them on to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. The surface pressure looks like they're dedicated to having the Ukraine start those invasions, assuming that Putin is just going to let them take the Ukraine, Crimea, and the East of the Ukraine under the control of Kiev.

Putin has said he won't allow that and has landing craft available for coastal support. The Kiev government has withdrawn its forces from the Russian border, recognizing that Russia isn't going to invade, and is putting them along the boundary between East and West Ukraine. They hope threatening to invade Crimea will get full support from the West and force Putin to back down. But I think Biden realizes that Putin isn't going to back down.

**Danny Roddy:** It sounds dark, but if we were to go to war, you'd almost hope that they [Russia] won, right? That would be a better situation for humanity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because the present bunch in Kiev honor Bandera, who was the leader under the Nazi invasion. They are literally neo-Nazis in control. No one really wants them in control; it's only because they create the war threat.

## Plagiarism and the Philosophy of Communication

**Danny Roddy:** I was thinking if we could do an episode about anti-stress nutrition for 2021. I think you're getting more popular, Ray, and as you grow more popular, some people find your nutritional ideas esoteric. I don't think that's true, but I thought maybe we could try our hand at encapsulating some of the core ideas.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They found them so esoteric that they blatantly plagiarized them and presented them as their own.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Ray, you'd be amazed at just how many "famous" podcasters are essentially reading off of your website and never mentioning your name even once. They actually verbatim pick up paragraphs from your website. You can search Google for a full sentence in quotation marks, and you'll be surprised how many other websites are just directly copying your stuff.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For years I've been running across things that are obviously my sentences in strange places.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Well, it's becoming mainstream. Some of the more famous podcasters—some former low-carbers and paleo advocates—are now fully getting on board with the metabolic diet and gaslighting their former clients by pretending that they're still low-carb but writing about your ideas.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, isn't there some philosophical angle for a directionless young man copying what they want to be? Like copying before you can develop into the person you're going to be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I couldn't guess for you, but maybe like Albert Szent-Györgyi or Heraclitus.

**Danny Roddy:** What I'm trying to say is if somebody copies something that I've written, I try not to take it personally because I know that I did it to you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah, it makes me feel good actually that someone likes my sentences.

**Danny Roddy:** Is it that plagiarism is the highest form of flattery?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's nice to see someone liking the same phrases.

**Danny Roddy:** But maybe in Wilhelm Reich's *Listen, Little Man*, he says if you just copy and you're not trying to add anything to it, that's the problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. That's where I think we have direct empirical knowledge of continuous creation. For the astronomers, it's the color of the galaxies. But in our own experience, it's the experience of communication as producing something new. Every time we talk, words don't directly transmit anything. A computer symbol transmits, but no intelligence is transmitted in a computable language.

In natural language, each word is an ambiguity, and the receiver has to do a creative invention to understand it. So every time someone is talking and really understanding what the other person is saying, the receiver is doing a creative act, creating new structures that never existed before in the universe. Talking is an example of continuous creation. As soon as you understand what they're saying, you have given them existence abroad in the world.

## Appetite, Cells, and Consciousness

**Danny Roddy:** You had a quote about a high-level view of nutrition. I think in the diet world, eating nutrition is like doing something you don't want to do—you really want to go to McDonald's. But you've talked about Pavlov and eating as our closest interaction with the world. What is nutrition's meaning to the organism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For many years, I've seen talking about food and understanding what food is doing as an extension of discussing philosophy and politics. It's a very powerful way of getting at the nature of existence and working on improving existence.

**Danny Roddy:** Could expanding consciousness be another way for improving existence?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Raising your body temperature makes it easier to create new levels of being. And when you have expanded your understanding, that makes everything you do easier. Things that you don't understand—like opening a door that's latched—if you don't understand the latch, you can't open the door. But once you understand it, then you can open all the doors with a similar latch. It makes your range of meaningful activity much greater.

**Danny Roddy:** What is your general view of appetite? I think dietary things are almost useless in the face of somebody having a really suppressed appetite.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it comes down to the question of our relationship to our cells and our molecules that make us up. Eventually, we have to start thinking of our cells as having appetite, judgment, and purpose. That has been demonstrated in unicellular organisms all the way down to bacteria—that they have planning, judgment, and purpose. If we deny that to our own internal cells, that just seems silly. Our nervous systems are intimately connected to our cells, and we get our motives essentially by listening to our cells. It's a sort of voting of the intelligent population of cells that we listen to and then execute with things like appetite.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think appetite can be equated with desire for life? Basically, the better your appetite, the more you want to live?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because you're in touch with and listening to your life process all the way down to molecules.

**Danny Roddy:** Let's say you have a great appetite, but different days you desire different foods. Do you think there's something more than just the organism sensing nutrients? Maybe certain foods create different meanings depending on what your mind and soul need?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. Variety is a real thing. You're wanting to discover more about the nature of the universe, and the desire for variety is part of that natural curiosity of our cells.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the customs of the Native American Indians? They believe that whatever food you eat gives you a piece of that animal spirit. They believed that eating the meat of only one animal—except for bison—was not a very good practice because it crystallizes you and makes you rigid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you read the experiments of McConnell in the 1950s? *The Worm Runner's Digest* was one version of his publication. He describes training planarians to respond in a certain way to light or dark, and then chopping the trained planarian up and feeding it to an untrained planarian. They gained the knowledge that was intended by the first planarian.

**Danny Roddy:** So basically memories are stored throughout the entire organism, not located in the brain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. George Unger followed up McConnell's work with different organisms. He found that the nucleic acid, especially RNA composition of a catfish, was changed according to what it was smelling in the water. The sensed or learned material causes molecular changes, and those molecular changes extracted from that organism can produce the same knowledge in an ignorant organism.

**Danny Roddy:** So when a person wakes up in the morning and has no appetite, you're saying that it's like the cumulative cells vote to decrease the rate of metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but something is going wrong and they have to sit back. Like when bacteria in James Shapiro's experiments are given an unmetabolizable sugar, they just sit back and wait for two days and then institute a gene change. They don't want to do anything prematurely.

## EMF and Cellular Perception

**Danny Roddy:** How do the cells achieve quorum? Is it done strictly through chemical signals or electromagnetic as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think both. Experiments by Beatrice Gelber in the 50s and 60s showed that the planarian can see what's happening. The anatomy of a single-celled organism has been known to include the equivalent of a focusing eyeball and brain. A professor of mine described meeting a specialist in amoebas who showed him photographs of the photosensitive spot of an amoeba. What people thought was just a reflex reaction when light hit that spot was actually shining a light in the "eyeball" of the amoeba.

**Danny Roddy:** Since we are now being bathed 24/7 in these electromagnetic frequencies, are they capable of interfering with the cells' ability to form a quorum?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been thinking about the interactions of our normal internal infrared wavelength emissions. Calculations and experiments have shown that about three-quarters of our metabolic energy is going out in that form of radiant energy. The whole signaling system is very responsive to the emissions from other wavelengths.

Gunther Albrecht-Buehler showed that under the microscope, focusing a very narrow beam of infrared light, he could get human cells to chase it. So definitely the infrared spectrum is part of our internal maintenance of organization. You don't want to mess with beaming those frequencies through the organism because they'll be taken as a signal for reorganization. You can disrupt basically every level of cell organization just with electromagnetic energy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, a specific electromagnetic radiation will probably randomly heat an organ whose cells are of the right size so that they start acting like an antenna?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. When they were studying the damage done by radar beam exposure, they found that the size of the organ resonates with the wavelength. A monkey with a small brain could be killed by a higher frequency that wouldn't severely damage a human with a big brain.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is it possible that even non-ionizing radiation, if it's of the right frequency, can cause DNA damage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Blue light, for example, does damage DNA.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I don't know if you've seen these papers published around May of 2020—which got immediately retracted—saying that 5G is now of the right frequency to cause holes inside of the cell, and the cell reacts by plugging these holes by producing endogenous viral particles that happen to match the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Do you think there's any truth to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably. If they had the data that led them to submit it for publication, I would suspect that the editors just didn't like it.

**Danny Roddy:** Isn't part of the problem with EMF that it's placing calcium where it's not supposed to be? So eating a high calcium diet and taking vitamin D would help mitigate the effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, one of the things that vitamin D and calcium accomplish is to reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH, under the influence of any kind of inflammation-promoting signal, turns down energy production. Eating calcium and vitamin D will tend to restore mitochondrial energy production, helping the cell to keep calcium out of the cells.

## Dietary Basics: Fat

**Danny Roddy:** Let's talk about basic requirements for a human living in 2021. Obviously gathering pulse and temperature. You've said many times: maybe 100 grams of protein, two to three times the amount of carbohydrate (favoring sugars over starches), and 1500 to 2000 milligrams or more of calcium. I don't know specifically your thoughts on fat. Could we dive into a fat gram amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If we had a source of pure palmitic and stearic acid, I think they would be safe. We could produce our own N-9 polyunsaturated fats. With oleic acid, palmitic and stearic acid fats are pretty safe. Some experiments show that cocoa butter, rich in stearic acid, protected the heart against damage caused by linoleic dietary PUFA. More recent experiments show that visceral fat percentage can be reduced by increasing stearic acid in the diet.

**Danny Roddy:** Assuming you could get a good source of saturated fat, would you feel comfortable putting a gram number on it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since I've never had the opportunity to have a pleasant tasting pure saturated fat, I would guess you could eat a lot of it.

**Danny Roddy:** What about non-activating the Randle cycle or being as efficient with your energy as possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar is my current understanding of what is most protective. Stress tends to increase your circulating free fatty acids, activating the Randle effect, blocking the ability to use sugar for energy. Increasing the sugar in your diet tends to lower the lipolytic activity, keeps the fat where it belongs, and prevents the Randle shift to fat oxidation. This maximizes your carbon dioxide production, which keeps your stress-producing lactic acid inhibited.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think there's a middle ground for longevity and taste regarding fat? Maybe sub-100 grams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you include oleic acid, stearic, and palmitic, I think something around an ounce would probably be ideal, but I don't think there would be any harm up to that.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Correct me if I'm wrong, Ray, but isn't the problem with most type 2 diabetics and obese people that they're under a chronically elevated lipolytic state under the influence of cortisol and estrogen? In that case, eating more saturated fat would actually help because it would increase the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the bloodstream.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and PUFA is a promoter of estrogenic effects in many different ways.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Quick question about androgens. Bodybuilders abuse steroids to lose weight and gain lean mass. Considering testosterone and progesterone are anti-lipolytic, how do they cause rapid fat loss?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver, when it's well nourished and activated by thyroid rather than estrogen effects, can harmlessly excrete PUFA. Any PUFA that appears in your bloodstream can be recognized by the liver as a toxin and inactivated by attaching glucuronic acid to it and causing it to be excreted in the urine.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the androgens are basically protecting the liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and thyroid, progesterone, and aspirin work in that direction.

**Danny Roddy:** Isn't hypothyroidism associated with gallbladder disease? What if somebody has a bad gallbladder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Taking thyroid clears it up very quickly and predictably. Getting the liver back to metabolizing properly, the gallbladder responds quickly, and you can start tolerating fats in your diet within just a few days.

## Dietary Basics: Protein

**Danny Roddy:** You've said that eating less than 100 grams of protein makes the liver think you're starving. What is the significance of that number?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It probably depends on the balance of amino acids. When your body senses a protein deficiency, it turns on proteolytic enzymes so that it takes down your thymus gland, lymph nodes, muscles, and skin. Those proteins are converted to the essential amino acids which your brain and essential organs need. The sense of protein deficiency is essentially a proteolytic state which takes your whole body down.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Doesn't the liver also need dietary protein specifically to produce sufficient amounts of albumin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh sure, but combined with thyroid function.

**Danny Roddy:** Would you revise this upwards? Is 100 grams a good base amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the military study, that was for even little people working at a desk job; that was required for efficiency.

**Danny Roddy:** Maybe 120-150 was even more appropriate for an older person?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The 100 was just the minimum for efficiency.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there a point at which this dietary protein can cause kidney issues in a hypothyroid person?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes experimented eating a lot more meat in his diet. He found he had to double his thyroid dose. It's very easy to overdo the protein, displacing carbohydrate and liberating the thyroid-suppressing tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine. Experiments using natural gelatin as a protein—lacking those antithyroid amino acids—showed they could tolerate a fairly higher dose of protein.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there a ratio of gelatin to the rest of the protein that you think is beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably. I think that changes with age and activity level. A young person who is growing at a very high metabolic rate needs more of the methionine, cysteine, tryptophan type protein.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there any role physiologically needed for tryptophan aside from producing niacin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A little bit for tissue replacement—making hair, skin, and gut cells that have to be shed. When you reduce any of those three amino acids to a minimum, life expectancy in animal experiments goes up tremendously.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there any way for somebody to gauge if they're becoming too deficient on tryptophan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Digestion is usually the first thing to go wrong. They'll start getting gas or some digestive symptom, which could be that they're not replacing the lining of the intestine fast enough.

## Dietary Basics: Carbohydrates and Sugar

**Danny Roddy:** Is there a base amount of carbohydrate you think a person needs to function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've experimented on people with a 100-gram carbohydrate diet, and I don't think that was even close to a good health level. I think it's probably around that range of 200 or 300 that's minimum.

**Danny Roddy:** What does it mean when a person needs way more than that, like 400 or 500?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Or they just have a very intense metabolic rate. If you're consuming oxygen at twice the rate of normal, then it would be reasonable to expect that you need closer to a pound of carbohydrate per day.

**Danny Roddy:** Would you expect them to increase the carbohydrate content getting into older age?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think increasing it is helpful.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What is your view of sugar alcohols like sorbitol in prune juice for constipation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it works as a laxative, you're going to absorb very little of it. But if it doesn't work as a laxative, then it would tend to get pushed into your tissues.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about xylitol as a mouthwash?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people react badly to it, and I don't know whether it's the xylitol itself or impurities from its manufacturing origin.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, if you can't get sweet oranges, what are other carbohydrate sources you feel comfortable with?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nixtamalized corn is my favorite safe starch because the lime process degrades so many of the toxic factors.

**Danny Roddy:** What about frying starchy foods in saturated fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, having it with fat decreases the ability of uncooked starch grains to cross the lining of the intestine.

**Danny Roddy:** What about orange juice concentrate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, especially if it's from sweet oranges.

**Danny Roddy:** I've been thinking about the meaning of ingesting citric acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We make it ourselves, but it stays within the mitochondrion. When you eat it as a chelator, it can drag all sorts of toxic metals into your bloodstream. And then being oxidized in the mitochondrion, it would be leaving behind whatever junk it dragged in with it.

**Danny Roddy:** So the sour orange juice is higher in citric acid and that is why it causes irritation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. People say that we produce citric acid normally, but it's a compartment thing. It's very isolated, and in the wrong place, it has very bad effects.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you know if they changed the Mexican Coke recipe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nope, I haven't heard anything about it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I noticed something similar. I bought cases of Mexican Coke, and then they replaced it with Guatemalan Coke, which had paper labels. It tastes horrifically metallic. Is it possible it has heavy metal contamination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. For years, the corn syrup was made with a metal catalyst. Some of it was left in the syrup, and so people were being heavy metal poisoned.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Would other acids that give tart taste, such as malic acid or acetic acid, have a potential detrimental chelating effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the ones that have two or three acid groups. Citric acid is the most effective chelator, but the double acid molecules can have a chelating action. Acetic acid is toxic in its own right in excess.

## Supplemental Foods: Liver and Oysters

**Danny Roddy:** Is regular consumption of supplemental foods like liver, oysters, and eggs part of your philosophy? The general idea being when you increase the rate of metabolism, you might need more nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Certain things you do need more of, but the higher energy metabolism makes you need less of anything. For example, when your thyroid level is proper and your vitamin D is good, your cells are able to hang on to magnesium. But the turnover of carbohydrate and protein has to go up directly with your metabolic rate.

**Danny Roddy:** So liver and oysters fortify a person's nutrition, ameliorating many different dietary deficiencies in two foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's too complicated to calculate in terms of individual things. The shotgun effect of eggs, liver, and shellfish is very important to fill in what you don't know.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there something about oysters or liver that make them more difficult to digest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the low fat content of the liver especially. The high protein gives you strong signals and requires a lot of extra sugar and preferably some saturated fat to go with it to slow down the absorption.

**Danny Roddy:** Would you consider liver without gelatin to be risky?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I just make sure to have lots of butter or other fat and sugar—ice cream, for example—after eating some liver. Otherwise, I've noticed it disturbs my sleep with hypoglycemia.

**Danny Roddy:** In terms of oysters, what is a good rule of thumb for how often and how much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For copper and selenium, once a week is enough. Probably two or three ounces.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you use the Crown Prince ones in olive oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's what I'm eating the last two or three years. I just open the can a crack and drain it thoroughly.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have some preparation that you enjoy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just having it with cheese and orange juice makes a really nice meal.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I drain the olive oil the same way Ray does, but I throw a tablespoon of salt on top of them and then fill up the can with vinegar. I found out that if I eat a lot of oysters without enough salt, it gave me insomnia.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Salt and gelatin are both very helpful for good sleep.

## Salt and Electrolytes

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have an amount of salt that you think is necessary for minimal functioning?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, you can adapt very well. When I worked in the woods, our cook was obsessed with the fact that sweating people needed extra salt, so he put a heaping spoonful in our porridge every morning. I found that I had so much salt in my sweat that it was crystallizing on my glasses. I decided to tell him my doctor put me on a low salt diet. Immediately, over the weekend, I didn't need salt tablets in the afternoon, and my sweat was like distilled water.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There are some recent human studies that claim that anything less than five grams of elemental sodium daily activates chronically the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Would you agree with that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, for sure. That tiny amount brings up your anxiety and inflammation. So salt is definitely anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory. A population in Mongolia, for example, eats an average of about 30 grams of salt per day and doesn't have hypertension.

**Danny Roddy:** So at least one teaspoon basic. What about calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always get at least 2500 mg and sometimes 5000 mg of calcium.

**Danny Roddy:** That'd be like a gallon of milk and some cheese?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think lithium can do a lot of these things at much lower amounts that sodium and calcium can do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I used to call it "super sodium" from some of its effects. But its effects on serotonin, I think, are a drawback to having much of it in your diet.

**Danny Roddy:** Isn't magnesium the basic calcium channel blocker?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It could be, but I haven't seen enough evidence of that. It's also the question of absorption and retention. Whatever gets in your cells stays there a very short time and is lost quickly.

**Danny Roddy:** So there's a reason so many different dietary camps agree on supplementing magnesium—they're probably hypometabolic and losing it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and to some extent calcium goes out as your stress hormones go up.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Some people have reported that their blood calcium is at the upper end of the normal range, and their doctor says not to worry. What's your take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That you should worry about it. It's probably decreasing in your bones and increasing in your brain and arteries.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think may be causing this mild hypercalcemia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet, mostly.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** I was reading a paper about "inflammaging." It argued that weak oxy-metabolism, the shift towards NADH and lactate, and the production of cytokines are what chronically activate the stress centers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but the basic thing is the failure of energy or the shift from oxidative to glycolytic energy. That predisposes you to all of the cytokine problems. They're like an amplifying system saying that the cells are in a bad state and evoking emergency measures.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm still working on adaptation based on cell learning—epigenetics as a continuous process of learning and adaptation. Following that, I think it's going to be how the estrogen system works, especially in breast and prostate cancer, and what can be done to intervene.

**Danny Roddy:** That was such a good conversation. Email Catherine at kenogen@gmail.com to purchase Progest-E. Ray, do you have any parting words?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, start learning Spanish. You'll have more fun.

**Danny Roddy:** Didn't you say learning a language would activate a different part of the nervous system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's more constructive to learn another language.

**Danny Roddy:** Awesome. Ray, thank you so much. Georgi Dinkov, thank you for being my partner in crime. We'll see you guys next week.
