## Introduction & Year in Review

**Danny Roddy:** Hey, everybody, welcome to Generative Energy, episode number 105. This is going to be a solo show with me, and I'm going to talk about what happened this year. I have my 2017 Android phone in front of me, and I'm just going to scroll through the camera wheel and try to figure out what happened this year.

Before anything, talking about this year without Ray Peat... I think the only way to describe my feelings on that is to reference a conversation I had with Dodie Anderson. Dodie has been a longtime friend of Ray, I think for 20 years. They had met multiple times and talked absolutely all the time on the phone. I remember telling Dodie that it felt worse over time, and she was like, "Yep, yep, yep, that's how it goes." That was not comforting, knowing that his loss is going to feel more potent over time, but I guess that's just how it goes.

If you remember what I said last year, I never really lost anybody close to me, so it was not a super fun experience. I have mixed feelings about what to do about the whole thing, but I'm always going to go with my heart. Doing right by him is one of the most important things to me. That will probably get me into trouble sometimes, but I feel like he gave me and everybody else so much, and he never asked for absolutely anything. Doing right by him is the most important thing, and doing right by Katherine, his widow, is equally important.

## Future Plans & Bioenergetic Basics

**Danny Roddy:** Generative Energy is probably going to be pretty sporadic this year. I think I planned something with Keith Littlewood—we'll probably talk in the next few months—but definitely not regular episodes. I'm going to turn lots of my attention to *Bioenergetic Basics*. That was that mini-podcast that I was doing. I think that's really the right move because I've never received so much positive feedback on something I've done that helps me with my job.

I can't tell you how many people I've talked to who said, "Oh, I listened to the Bioenergetic Basics thing, and I realized I was taking too much T3 or not taking enough T4."

There is a meme on Twitter now of "Bulgarian Peating" versus "Mexican Peating." As a person like myself, having experienced really bad illness, I think there are safe ways of going about it. That's my message: how to do this stuff in a safe way. I think Ray was really concerned about that too—risk aversion in the sense of not using the most new, possibly dangerous, risky chemicals.

My story involves stopping a lot of supplements, improving my digestion, and realizing that I was harming myself for long periods of time. I think a lot of people do that. I talk to eight or nine people a day, and I see this absolutely all the time. My message is not this ultra-experimental approach. It's more the tried-and-true method of assessing thyroid function, getting the vitamin D level up, eating well, trying to solve bowel problems, and optimizing your environment. Those are things I really believe in.

I have my first digital product in probably 10 years. It's called *Bioenergetic Basics* and it's a course. I recorded this thing probably a dozen times and finally got it to the point where I liked it. It's an hour and ten minutes, cut down from about two and a half hours, so there's lots of editing for it to be as dense as possible. The whole goal was to promote safe practices—all the things that I talk about in one-on-ones absolutely all the time, over 10 years of experience—in a concise way where all the information is in one place.

You can find that on Patreon (patreon.com/dannyroddy) on the shop tab, and you can also find it on Gumroad. To be honest, I think that's better than paying to talk to me. A lot of times I see people's eyes glaze over when we're talking because it's a lot of information to take in at one time. This course is something that you can stop, rewind, and slow down.

## Homesteading: Puppies and Solar Power

**Danny Roddy:** I'm looking at my Instagram here. The guys are probably bored of me talking about this, but I got puppies in January. Let me back up here for a second. I am literally quoted saying, "If the universe wants me to have dogs, I'll get them." Maybe within three or four months of saying that, my mailman came to my house to deliver some packages and he gave me two tiny dogs in a Huggies box. My brain executed a file to rapidly figure out why *not* to take these dogs, but it came up with an error—question mark, empty folder—and I took them.

This was while I was having trouble with chickens and was already stressed out taking care of 30 chickens. I took these dogs and I had no idea what I was doing. I haven't taken care of two dogs ever. I gave them some milk and I was on a phone call and told the person, "You're not going to believe this, but I just inherited two little dogs." The person said, "RIP your sleep."

That was the beginning of a challenging situation. I didn't have a place for these dogs, they kept waking me up every single night, and I'd wake up to cleaning up poop and pee. It taught me so much respect for people that have children. It's basically like you sacrifice some amount of yourself for them. I aged a little bit more this year because I have dogs. It made me really think that I could not have children because I think my health would really suffer in the process.

Also in January or February, I got a new solar system. I had a 20-year-old solar system that was extremely outdated. I use way too much electricity—I use these 250-watt lights, I have a distiller, and I use the microwave all the time. When it was cloudy for a day, I'd have to seriously watch my usage. Electricity would just turn off absolutely all the time. This house is completely off-grid.

I got a new solar system. It was a miracle and it worked really well. I've been adding batteries over this entire year. To be honest, even in December, because it's been very cloudy this entire year, it makes me want to get double the amount of batteries. If you have any desire whatsoever to do this off-grid lifestyle, it is so hard. Not only do you have to put tons of cash into it, you have to start now. Waiting until things get bad to start doing this stuff won't work out well because the learning curve is extremely high. I wouldn't know that I needed six more batteries until I went through December with six batteries and realized I need 12. That's like $16,000.

## Equipment Recommendations

**Danny Roddy:** Something else I figured out in February was the Premier 1 Supplies Prima Heat Lamp. This thing is absolutely incredible. It's for chickens, but I moved it into the office. The reason it's so nice is it recesses the 250-watt bulb in the back of the unit and makes a fire way less likely. Those old aluminum brooders—I've almost started fires with those things probably three or four times, and I can't even count the amount of times I've smashed those bulbs. These things are a game changer and they're not expensive, maybe $55. Any product I mention, I have zero affiliations with.

In May, I got a fence. I was watching a security homestead video—I think the guy's name was Spiro—and he said, "Listen, if you have a property, you absolutely have to put a fence around it because people just wander on it and say they didn't know." This guy was totally right. There was a dude—not dangerous in any way—who thought cutting through the property was a quicker route to wherever he was trying to go. I explained to him that it was private property, and he could have absolutely cared less. He would go through the property, stop at my gate, and expect me to open it for him. It was bizarre. Since I purchased the fence, that gentleman has not been back.

Also, the CT Classic Water Distiller. Again, no affiliation. This thing is incredible. The well water on this property is very toxic; it has lots of fluoride, arsenic, and I think lead as well. The CT Classic Distiller gets rid of all of that. I run this thing four or five times per day when it's sunny and it's just a workhorse. I've been running it absolutely all year. For it not to have broken down for how much I use it is crazy.

## Diet and Chicken Care

**Danny Roddy:** I'm looking at a photo of a meal that I've had about a thousand times this year: eggs, Emmentaler cheese, and well-cooked zucchini. I've definitely been eating more eggs and less meat this year. I don't notice any negatives from it health-wise.

Regarding the chickens, I got new birds in April. Raising chicks again was fun. Now all those birds are laying tons of eggs and I feel like I really dialed in their diet. I was feeding them milk for a while, but that really did not work. They waste a ton of it and they did not look that well. I had the bright idea to switch to cheese and they seem to be doing infinitely better on that. It's actually easier; the cheese has a smaller footprint in the refrigerator.

I feed them grated Mennonite cheese, guavas blended up with distilled water and baking soda, carrot with coconut oil, and occasionally liver. They're doing absolutely fantastic on it. I do need something to shred the cheese because shredding two or three kilos every morning is getting old.

We started building a new chicken run in July and finished in August. That was a game changer. We moved the chickens from a small little area to an absolutely gigantic area, and I think that improved their health almost instantaneously. Chickens in a small space become listless, lethargic, and bored. When I put them in the new space, they brightened up immediately.

I have about 30 chickens, but I'd love to have a hundred. Their diet is pretty expensive, so I need a plan to start selling these eggs. The brand is called "Huevelismos." The eggs are incredible—they taste really good, are very hearty, very filling, and the yolk is very creamy. Raising these chickens has been a good way to distract myself from the terrors of reality.

I also got a new automatic chicken door in October. If you look at chicken doors, you'll find a lot of reviews say, "This door killed my chickens." I did a ridiculous amount of research and ended up on the Pullet-Shut door. I love this thing. It's super well-built and heavy-duty.

## Coaching Insights: Gut Health & Supplements

**Danny Roddy:** Plans for the future include recording lots of *Bioenergetic Basics* episodes. Some titles I'm thinking about:
*   Safe Supplements
*   A Starting Place for Getting into Ray's Work
*   Overcoming Milk Intolerance
*   Solving Male Virility Problems
*   Troubleshooting Sleep Problems

If you have any thoughts, please post below on Substack.

Something I learned from people this year resonates with a quote from Ray. He said that very often when somebody is talking to you, they want to set the context of what's wrong and how you need to approach it. For example, somebody will say, "I have heavy metal poisoning, that's what's causing my problem, and you need to help me with that." It's a challenging situation. I know I've been in that same situation—framing how I think the problem is manifesting and being resistant to basically everything the other person says.

The thing that seems to be really useful is trying to facilitate what the person wants to do in a safe way—not recommending things that are dangerous, but also validating what they're talking about as much as possible. That seems to be more of what coaching is about than relaying technical information.

A substance that seemed to really stand out this year was Cascara Sagrada. This started with somebody who was not responding to basically anything. I think they were even taking large doses of thyroid and it was not helping. He didn't start to notice the effects of anything until he started using Cascara and inducing bowel movements. Thyroid *should* promote bowel movements, but it was not for whatever reason. This person told me they had a huge sigh of relief when they started using the Cascara.

That has happened so many times since. Especially when I hear constipation, I start recommending Cascara because it seems so effective. If a person is immune to everything they're doing, 99% of the time the intestine is the problem. Solving constipation will likely enhance the person's ability to notice what they're employing, whether it's thyroid or whatever. Likewise, if vitamin D and calcium are low, the parathyroid hormone is high, which could create a similar situation. I think parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of serotonin by degranulating mast cells.

One of the ways of being flexible is realizing that when somebody tells you they're taking a quarter of a Cynoplus and a few doses of Cytomel and they're not noticing anything, the intestine is usually always the problem.

## Dirty Electricity

**Danny Roddy:** One other thing I'll mention is dirty electricity. Within the last two months, I was having an audio buzz and looking for solutions. I saw somebody pull out a receptacle tester that I have, and I thought, "Oh, I'll check the dirty electricity on the house." It was so high. I think because I have a solar system, I just couldn't believe it.

I strategically moved filters into my office and the kitchen, closer to the solar system, and it made a pretty big difference. For example, if I sat in one area of the room, I could get tinnitus if I sat there for long enough, and the filters noticeably reduced it. The dirty electricity in this house was absolutely crazy—like a hundred times the safe amount. I have those Greenwave filters (no affiliation) and I purchased probably 20 more of them.

## 2024 Predictions & Preparedness

**Danny Roddy:** We should probably talk about what's going to happen in 2024. I cannot possibly think of how something big could *not* happen next year because of the presidential election. I don't think it really matters who holds the presidency, but clearly the powers that be do not like Trump. I don't subscribe to the idea that everybody's in on it, but clearly the power structure that owns the media just did not like him.

There's something called the Transition Integrity Project, headed by John Podesta. My understanding of that was that under no circumstance could Trump win the last election, and the stakes are even higher this time. These people have already proven to be completely psychotic. They're obviously preparing people for a cyber attack or a power outage, so I would not be surprised if that happened.

Something that really irritates me is when people say, "Oh, you got to think more positively." To me, that is like somebody beating you up, forcing you to take an injection you didn't want, firing you from your job, distancing you from your family, and then telling you, "Hey, I'm coming back to turn off your power and take your food." In that situation, telling the person to think more positively seems completely delusional.

I would expect power being out in the USA for a week, a month, or six months. That would be the worst situation imaginable—toilets not working, septic systems backing up, people completely wigging out, not being able to get their meds. There was a blackout in 2003—I put the video on my Telegram—and people are so unprepared. I would take a blackout in 2003 versus 2024.

Having food, having water, having a way to defend yourself, and having cash would go a long way. That's what I'm doing. I'm excited about the positive things about 2024, but the political and socioeconomic stuff, not so much.

One of the reasons I felt emboldened this year was knowing how many people felt the same way about Ray that I did. I did not feel alone. Again, I think the only thing to do is to do right by Ray, and I'll always try to follow that. If what I'm doing does not look like that, I'll have to think about it and reorient myself.

Appreciate you guys so much. Thank you, have a great rest of your day, and peace out.
