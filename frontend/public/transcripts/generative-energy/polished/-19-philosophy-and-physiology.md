## Introduction: Aristotle, Culture, and Language

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, and we're live. Hello, everybody. Welcome. We have Georgi and Mr. Raymond Peat on the line, and we are talking about Aristotle. We were talking about forms, matter, and deep politics. I'm not going to interrupt what we were talking about, but Georgi, go ahead.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yeah, I was curious what Dr. Peat thinks made specific parts of the world amenable to such contradictory ideas. Is it something in the way people saw reality in those different parts of the world? Why would Eastern Europe or the Eastern world be so amenable to change, while the Western world would be like, "Nope, we're firmly controlled; that's the only theory that we accept is true"? Change must be happening everywhere. Why would it take root in certain parts of the world and not others?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the '50s, I was considering the Whorfian hypothesis—that the structure of language has evolved in remote history and contributes to that. But I fairly quickly realized that cultural things, such as the difference between Aristotle and Plato in the available literature when people were just starting to get literate, played a role. The church was a force for literacy, and it happened that the Eastern Christian church got the good Aristotle literature, and the West was influenced by Platonism.

So I still tend to think that there are slight differences from the structure of language. There's a linguist at Stanford who is the contemporary Whorfian apologist. I think that can be seen in the difference between English and German, for example, and between Chinese and Hindi. Chinese has, through use, reduced the superstructure of grammatical form and depends greatly on context. I think that there's a noticeable difference between English and the older European languages, with more context dependence in English grammar.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the ideas of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. The thing I liked about him was that he numbered his paragraphs instead of trying to make a grand argument that progressed logically. He simply made statements and numbered them because he believed that every statement implies a metaphysical surrounding.

I had been studying Bertrand Russell and the linguistic philosophers who followed him—like John Wisdom—who I saw as trying to sneak in the old Platonism entities, logical atomism, for example. Wittgenstein blew that up and showed somewhat a resonance with the old Leibniz: a universe being implied in every statement, or every event implying the surrounding context.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The thing that made the most impression on me is that he said there's no such thing as private language. There are no private thoughts; they can all be expressed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but when you try to work out the implications of "there is no private language," you're always guessing statistically that you're understanding the other person. If you can't remember for sure, your own language is consistent and testable. When you look at the other person, you're just making a statistically sounder guess, but there's no essential difference between shared language and the private language once you realize that they all depend on memory and interpretation.

## Memory, Matter, and Knowledge

**Georgi Dinkov:** That leads me to the next question. You had a discussion with Danny about Lenin, memory, and matter. You said Lenin stated that knowledge is memory and it's coming from matter, but it's not matter. Matter is everything we don't know. So what is knowledge then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the physiological presence of matter, and the info is the matter itself that hasn't been incorporated into our perspective.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So would you say that knowledge is simply the structure of matter that we incorporate into ourselves?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It's living matter and it's always open to living a new phase, and that openness to new life is matter. Info is all we can say about matter. It's not denying the materiality. It's saying that this is the living matter that is our consciousness, and that's like an internal fountain. It's always going on, going ahead, becoming something else. And that's the nature of matter, that it's creating this constant flow of knowledge.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In another interview, you basically said that nothing is stored. Basically, how we feel about our memories and knowledge depends largely on thyroid function and metabolism. If knowledge isn't stored, where is it? When we access a memory, what does that process physiologically look like?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's some trace in our facial muscles, viscera, posture. We work through a series of reinventions, finding these pictures, which are arrangements of excitations. We don't go straight to a picture; we work by inference and traces to reconstruct it. And so every time we bring up the past, we're creating a new past. It's always newly experienced.

The idea that something is stored becomes part of that Platonist idea that ends up saying atoms are timeless entities and can be accurately described only by changeless units of logic. You can't let change into the system if you're in that logical atomism range. Platonism is denying that an individual atom has a history. The memory as reconstruction is that we're like a whirlwind of consciousness; the shape of our individual whirlwind is always ongoing but is moving ahead with some degree of deduction from our previous states. Looking back, it's like a reverse deduction to reconstruct that we must have experienced that being where we are.

## Animal Reality and Ecosystems

**Danny Roddy:** In one of those same conversations, I was asking you some philosophical questions and you said something like you have to start and end with being an animal. Can you talk about that a little bit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An animal experiencing nature or people around it is aware of its needs and hopes, and also any fears that it has. It interprets particular objects or processes as either hopeful or fearsome. Otherwise, it's in the process of going through the present situation with the intention of finding the realization of what it wants.

Culture has piled up belief and stories that complicate that so that we don't see ourselves as surrounded by future possibilities and threats. I think anytime you're going to get back on the track of realizing yourself, the larger intention—the thing that religious people feel as some kind of overarching meaning—is for the biologically amplified animal to do things that some animals can't do.

By our energy amplification, we can have the animal intentionality encompassing future possibilities on a transpersonal scale, seeing the need for the ecosystem, for the society, for other individuals, and even for different kinds of organisms. Taking responsibility in a straight line with yourself, feeling that you're responsible for all of the stuff around you, seeing it all as hopeful moving towards the future, and not having any of these cultural kinks that say, "I own this," or "I have to destroy this to do this."

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you saying that amplified rate of metabolism coexists with a sense of solidarity with other humans, or the Kropotkin mutual aid, assuming your basic needs are met?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I see Kropotkin blending in with Vernadsky. Vernadsky said that the flow of energy from the sun into the earth is creating a living structural system that is assimilating and accumulating the interactions of the different levels of the ecosystem. This permits optimizing the metabolism of the big animal, developing a big brain, and doing the things that are appropriate. Like animals tearing through the jungle are improving the fertility of the system, not damaging it. Like Alan Savory—his rough idea is compatible with Vernadsky, that the big animals are a big part of the ecosystems that they develop in and they are helping to pull the whole ecosystem forward.

## Verbal vs. Pictorial Thought

**Georgi Dinkov:** On the "being an animal" concept, are you referring to Pavlov's ideas of the first and second signal system? The first signal system being the animal raw perception of reality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't see it as being strictly second. P.K. Anokhin, a colleague younger than Pavlov, developed the picture of consciousness in this unified sense. He called it the "acceptor of action." It's the present state of the organism in a pictorial, space-filling model of the world.

The second signal system, in Pavlov's term, gets its structure by acting as names for structures in this acceptor of action. You have a little three-dimensional holographic movie going on with your intentions cycling through this movie model of the world. The words—the second signal system—attach to each part of the model of the world. Marx or Engels referred to it as a "name of a ghost." The second signal system gets its structure exclusively from this pictorial model of the world.

**Georgi Dinkov:** To me, the way I understood your book was that intuition was part of the first signal system, and then this capacity for rigid, analytical, abstract thought felt like it didn't even need images. That was part of the second signal system. The authoritarian mind tends to really emphasize the second signal system—purely abstract thought without any connection to reality.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was studying psychology at the university, I did a survey asking people how they dreamed as well as their waking thought processes. I found that there were people who didn't know what it was to dream in pictures. They said a dream was like listening to someone tell a story. Those people were absolute zero on a scale of creativity. They followed verbal rules. Somehow they could talk to people and seem to communicate in English, but they had no ability to think with any innovation.

When your acceptor of action is de-energized, it tends to disappear, leaving just these solidified units of language. You can't learn a language without having some fluidity in this model of the world. But by the age of six or seven, people are often losing enough biological energy that they start seeing reality in terms of only the cliches that they can say.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I stumbled upon a symptom in psychiatry called Logorrhea—literally verbal diarrhea. Older studies show it's overwhelmingly connected to psychiatric conditions driven by excess estrogen and serotonin. Do you think that this excessive verbalism is partly mediated by estrogen and serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Women in general produce many more words per minute than men on average. Starting at the menstrual phase, when estrogen is highest, they can't stop talking. I think that involves a short circuit of the pictorial, space-filling thought and directing the energy through these repetitive verbal patterns.

The thing about the acceptor of action, the pictorial model of the world, is that it's always changing. There's nothing repeated. Anything you try to do twice, it's always different the second time. The word consciousness—the estrogen-driven, lubricated word machine—doesn't get any newness admitted. It's always repeating, tending to be cliched.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of your older interviews, you mentioned that you try to spend at least one day a week not uttering any words or reading, just painting and doing non-verbal activities. Do you think that excessive verbalization, when it's voluntary, can be detrimental?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not if you keep your energy up. When I had to teach 12 hours a week, after just two or three weeks, my verbal fluency went up tremendously just because I was exercising that. But I never repeated any idea twice through the whole series of lectures. If you keep your energy up, you can verbalize fairly fluently, but always bending the message a little so there's nothing repeated.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that a unique aspect of your personality, or do you think that's a metabolic thing of trying to always stay in a creative mindset?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I first noticed it when I was three years old and helping my father with a repetitive task. I realized that every time I repeated the task, I was a new person. And ever since then, I've never been able to have the illusion of doing something twice.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If that's the case, then don't you think that schools are really harmful because they emphasize this routine at every step of the educational process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If a person lets themselves be tortured constantly... you just have to be quiet and let them do their thing.

**Danny Roddy:** I feel like one of the worst parts about school was sitting down. Now learning about restraint stress, that seems part of the torture.

**Georgi Dinkov:** My only concern is that you once said that "faint stupidity becomes real stupidity." So I guess a person just has to be sitting there and hoping that they're not going to be stuck in the educational system long enough to become an idiot like all the other people being turned into mental slaves.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who did IQ tests on New York City schools found that every year the students were given more IQ tests, their IQ went down.

## Vaccines, Allergies, and Public Health

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, do you see vaccinations, besides the food and the polyunsaturated fats, as a major problem for society?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Until fairly recently, I hadn't realized that kids are now getting 50 shots by the time they grow up. Robert Kennedy Jr. mentioned that until 1980, only 2.5% of kids had allergies. Starting in the 1980s, over half of the kids now have serious allergies.

If you want to create an allergy in an animal, you give it an injection. Intramuscular is ideal to include some little thing like an egg protein or milk protein, or any of the various proteins that are in the culture media that they make vaccines in. So they are replicating animal allergy creation every time they give a shot. There's no way to deny it sensibly.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think they take on a different meaning nowadays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think the money—billions of dollars, 50 billion a year in profits—is mostly from the sale of just vaccines.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was shocked to see CNN last week putting a headline news that basically said, "CDC is warning: It's not a question of if, but when coronavirus will create a massive epidemic in the United States." Why would a health agency issue such a statement? It seems like scaring all of its citizens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CDC has been saying that the annual deaths produced by influenza range from 9 million to a high of 57 million deaths worldwide per year. Now they expect us to get excited when a dozen people die.

**Danny Roddy:** I have a Twitter application on my phone. When I turn it on, there is a new huge bar on the screen just updating me on coronavirus. I've never asked for updates on coronavirus. It just seems like the marketing campaign is palpable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and the World Health Organization is sharing in the corruption and conflicts of interest. You can't trust any of the big organizations because they manage to profit in some way from the huge amount of wealth that's being directed through the vaccines.

## Viral Resilience and PUFA

**Georgi Dinkov:** I was reading some older studies showing that the more hydrophilic the cell is, the greater its susceptibility to a viral infection. Doesn't that suggest that the presence of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in the blood would increase susceptibility to the virus? Studies published before the 1950s made that exact claim.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That whole subject of polyunsaturated fats is worse than any organized crime campaign. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats are gigantic criminal businesses, and the omega-3 fats are especially powerful in immune suppression, but they market that as being anti-inflammatory.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Wouldn't something as simple as taking some aspirin and niacinamide essentially greatly reduce the risk of catching any viral infection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. And aspirin happens to be an antiviral agent in itself, antibacterial and antiviral. There was a study around Washington, DC, that tested it on AIDS patients. Just big doses of aspirin, and it was working, but no one was interested.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, one of the papers you cited said, "It is perhaps surprising that essential lipids that are supposed to be so good for health are so potent at killing cells."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Immunodeficiency is a big thing apart from any virus. Sepsis has been growing along with other degenerative diseases. Young people never used to get sepsis practically, but now sepsis is affecting younger and younger people in bigger numbers. I think it's largely the stress cumulative effects on PUFA.

## Herd Immunity and Vaccine Safety

**Danny Roddy:** Something that's popular among my group of friends is the idea of herd immunity. Do you want to speak about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It sounds very much like a Nazi program. It doesn't have any convincing weight for me. It just makes me fear the people that say we're a herd that has to be treated one way or another.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you seen any of that movie *Vaxxed*? They talk about the military vaccinating people and creating Gulf War syndrome with the anthrax vaccine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I hadn't read that specifically, but Diana Dutton wrote a book called *Worse Than the Disease* where she details the swine flu. One guy was routed out of bed to go on a forced march, collapsed, and died. He was diagnosed as having swine flu—the only death acknowledged by the head of the CDC. But there were thousands of paralytic reactions and around 300 deaths from the vaccine. So hundreds of times worse than the disease.

## Cancer, Endotoxin, and Metabolism

**Georgi Dinkov:** I wanted to mention something about HIV. A study around 2014 showed that you cannot develop AIDS unless there are high levels of endotoxin in your blood. A subsequent study in 2018 showed that the single most reliable predictor of death in HIV positive people was the level of soluble CD14, which is a biomarker of endotoxin. I never see virologists talk about the role of endotoxin in viral disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm inclined to think that even cancer is largely an endotoxin problem. Chronic year after year of bad food irritating the intestine, causing increased histamine, serotonin, and estrogen, but a constant stream of endotoxin flowing through the system. This shakes up chromosomes, creates inflammation, and fatigues the repair systems. Finally, when the repair systems are down, the cancers that are constantly popping up stop being removed.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So would you say the specific organ where the cancer appears is simply because that particular organ was the most energetically compromised?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When I've mentioned the idea of systemic disease to cancer doctors, they can't grasp it. They've been so indoctrinated with the idea that it's a clone—that one single mutant cell develops into the clone. But way back 80 or 90 years, people have been seeing precancerous gradations surrounding any tumor. The field concept of cancer goes way back almost 200 years.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the study from 2015 regarding the Warburg effect? It basically said that metabolic disturbances and specifically lactic acid precede the genomic abnormalities and are actually the cause of them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Lactic acid creates a reduced state, shifts the balance towards increased sulfhydryl, NADH ratio to NAD. All of the electronic and energetic properties of cancer are initiated just by putting a lot of lactic acid into the system.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I saw doctors chiming in on social media saying, "Oh my God, if this is true, it means in my practice as an oncologist, I've been killing people."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Did you ever read Max Gerson's book, *59 Cases*? Coffee enemas were one of his staples. He generally gave people thyroid and tried to get their metabolism towards oxidative energy production. But cleaning the intestine was probably his single most effective thing. He actually cured numerous advanced cases of cancer. I think chronically keeping the endotoxin down gives the recuperative system a great chance.

**Georgi Dinkov:** That would explain why recent studies with tetracycline and doxycycline are reporting such remarkable effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In 1965, a doctor sent me an argument that he was curing cancer with antibiotics. I didn't at that time think of it in terms of cutting out the endotoxin, but people have been doing it repeatedly over several decades.

There have been a couple of studies in which people accidentally noticed that women given an antibiotic course recovered from their headaches, but blood tests found that before the antibiotic, they had high estrogen and cortisol and low progesterone. After the course of antibiotics, their progesterone went up and both cortisol and estrogen went down—both of which would favor recovery from cancer.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you know that cortisol is given to pretty much any cancer patient as a standard treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Along with morphine. And morphine increases histamine release. Histamine is a powerful tumor promoter, so they usually adjust the dose so that they're dead before they notice that the tumor has grown faster.

## Receptors and Estrogen

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, would you put Paul Ehrlich in the pantheon of people that have ruined science?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He popularized the whole idea of lock-and-key receptor specificity. That whole receptor idea is perfect for selling chemicals. Every chemical can have a receptor. The holistic, ongoing whirlwind picture of the organism—where a large dose of a chemical can have an opposite effect of a small dose—is no good for the chemical industry.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I looked at all the hormones and their receptor structures. There is a significant overlap in the amino acid sequence. Is it even possible to develop a truly selective receptor compound?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I don't think so. The whole idea of receptors derives from Ehrlich and I think it's corrupt right down to its foundation. Pavlov and Szent-Györgyi were familiar with the idea that the dose determines the effect. A small amount of caffeine is sedative, a large amount is stimulating, and an even larger amount is narcotic. The typical curve has been tested on hundreds of substances and it consistently contradicts the idea of a specific receptor doing a specific thing.

You have to think of the cell as a substance which can move from one phase to another, potentially a series of phases, each having a characteristic behavior. The differentiation occurs in the cytoplasm as a whole.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the recent news about the resurgence of hormone replacement therapy with estrogen? They're trying to put down the findings of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About every five or ten years, the actual science makes a little headway. The big headway was the WHI, and within five years, the people at Stanford were explaining why estrogen didn't really cause cancer, strokes, and heart attacks. Their favorite explanation is that it's really progesterone.

Originally, estrogen was recognized as doing certain things, and they identified the estrogen receptor. Even though hypoxia in the absence of estrogen will cause the receptor to behave the same. Estrogen creates hypoxia. When they needed to explain away that estrogen does everything that it does, they discovered the estrogen receptor beta. It turns out that almost everything that estrogen *doesn't* do, the beta does—it stops growth and parallels the actions of progesterone. They're just thinking wildly of ways that they can say that progesterone is responsible for all of the bad stuff that has been blamed on estrogen.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I emailed one of the authors of a big study calling for the reintroduction of estrogen. I asked, "How can you argue that estrogen is good considering that your own organization [NIH] has a webpage which says estrogen is a carcinogen and a mutagen?" He said, "Estrogen has non-genomic effects that are actually beneficial... if we give it at lower dosages, it acts as a powerful antioxidant."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alexander Lipschutz, from about 1938 through the 1940s, did many animal experiments showing that even very small doses of estrogen, unless they were interrupted with progesterone, were carcinogenic not just to the uterus and breast but to the lungs, kidneys, and brain.

## Ray Peat's General Hypothesis

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, people say all sorts of things about why you do what you do. What is your perspective of what maintains health and what differentiates it into the state of sickness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two simple choices. One: the genes have been laid out, creating a blueprint, and all the energy has to do is keep them running. That orientation leads to the idea that the less you live, the longer you will live—that you're going to burn up the apparatus the faster you use it. That comes from the reductionist idea of a machine laid out in genetic blueprints.

The other picture is the developmental picture: that energy flowing from the sun through the atmosphere is creating structures. The flow of energy itself generates structures. The faster the energy flows, the more complex the structure becomes, and the more energy is saved in the system in the form of complexity. It's the speed with which you can waste the energy while responding to it, building your complexity, that is holding up the whole structure. It's simply a picture of an ecosystem responding physically to energy.

## Politics and Empire

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, do you think there's a way forward with the system we have? Do you see glimmers of hope?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you know who Ann Coulter is? I think of her as the personification of goofy reactionary philosophy. But weirdly, she has made some of the most insightful comments about what's going on now. Comparing Bernie Sanders and Trump, she pointed out that the very things Trump campaigned on but didn't fulfill—keeping us out of war, taxing the untaxed corporations, and stopping immigration—Bernie has identical policies to what people were perceiving as Trump's campaign promises. She says that he is Trump's real threat.

**Danny Roddy:** I'm torn on the immigration issue. I read Bucky Fuller saying there shouldn't be borders.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bucky Fuller would say that the corollary is that you stop creating horror experiences at home. Like imposing a fascist on Honduras. Obviously, it's an improvement for them to try to get into the United States, but simply stopping the oppression of third-world countries would stop the immigration. Hondurans would rather live in Honduras with a better standard of living.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think this empire or any empire can be reformed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think theoretically a controlled collapse of the empire is possible—withdrawing the army more or less quickly. If you freed up the Pentagon budget, 90% of it, that amount of money removed from military destruction could far more than finance any kind of Bernie Sanders programs.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would be your response to a person who understands the system is killing them but is shaking with anxiety? Where do they start?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think organizing. That's exactly where the power system exists—any impulse towards organization gets interrupted. New ways of organizing have to develop.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the cultural push towards extreme individualism is an attempt at implementing this isolation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. That's at the heart of preventing organization.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Where is the middle ground?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the first thing is to just start lots of organizations. Two or three people in a group deciding on possible courses of action. Create networks of just little personal interaction groups. If you have two million little groups developing, it will overwhelm the FBI's manpower advantage.

## Consciousness and Time

**Georgi Dinkov:** There have been studies suggesting that medicine has been looking at consciousness the wrong way—the "hard problem." Is consciousness a basic property of matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. I formulated it that way in 1957. I think of consciousness as a substance in itself. I think the donor-acceptor relationship activates a constant oscillation of excited electrons through the neurons. It's a substance analogous to the conductive electron bands in metal, but the electrons are existing on the soft cytoplasmic material.

P.K. Anokhin saw his "acceptor of action" consciousness model as existing as an excited electron substance which follows the rules of Gestalt psychology. It is actually space-filling material of electron plasma.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the frequencies of nerve firing are nothing really related to consciousness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are like the infrastructure of maintaining energy production and substance distribution, but the experience is floating over the infrastructure.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Speaking of resonance, Rupert Sheldrake writes about morphogenetic fields. If two people's consciousnesses are resonating, is there a limit to the distance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the communication can probably be carried on like a carrier wave on the Earth's resonance frequencies—the Schumann resonant frequencies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think time is in terms of a physical entity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My best guess is that Forrest Dudley was right and he described it as the neutrino sea. He proposed that neutrinos have energy and associate with matter according to its mass. Being through time, passing through time as a mass, allows these neutrinos to interact. My inference is that the brain, this structure of donor-acceptor activated gel of electrons, is able to tap into the energy of the neutrino sea. This is where the introduction of novelty as well as energy comes from.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the stars are perhaps the most intense entities with the most intense metabolism, would you say that they possess a type of consciousness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would think a galaxy, the streaming shape-creating forces of galaxies, are probably conscious. There's no more streaming energy through matter than a galaxy in action. But I think our brains are rivaling the galaxies for the complexity of activated substance.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** We're up to about two hours. Ray, Georgi, thank you so much for making this possible. Any parting words, Ray? Can you tell people how to obtain your newsletter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. And see if you can have people come up with ideas and create new organizations.

**Danny Roddy:** I love it. Georgi?

**Georgi Dinkov:** I'm privileged enough to start being able to make my own studies. I was thinking of doing one on essential fatty acid depletion to prove that the symptoms seen in the 1930s were just deficiencies of specific nutrients or calories.

**Danny Roddy:** Awesome. Thank you guys so much.
