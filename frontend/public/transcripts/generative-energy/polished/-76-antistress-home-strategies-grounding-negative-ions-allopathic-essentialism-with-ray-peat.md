# Generative Energy Podcast: 2021 Year in Review

## Introduction: Financial Preparedness

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat. We were just talking about redundancy, prepping, and being prepared for a future where they kick you out of the financial system, tell you you can't go to the grocery store. What else, Ray? What else will we not be allowed to do in the future?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Basically, anything that spends money.

**Danny Roddy:** We're talking about prepping for a momentary thing, but if you're kicked out of the financial system for life, there is going to have to be a rise of new, alternative ways of exchange, correct?

**David Morgan:** Yeah, a lot of people are getting silver. Gold doesn't work too well for daily exchanges because you'd have to chop it up into tiny pieces. But silver is convenient as a practical currency.

**Danny Roddy:** Excuse my ignorance, but how would that even work? Would the person know how much an ounce or a tiny amount of gold would be valued at in exchange?

**David Morgan:** With gold, it involves a certain amount of trust that the person doesn't have some strange alloy that they are pawning off. But silver is very practical in the sense that you can carry enough in your pocket to feed yourself for quite a few days, and it's identifiable as silver rather than other things.

**Danny Roddy:** In Klaus Schwab's book—I have not read the book, unfortunately—I think he says people will live outside the smart cities. So that alternative economy... even the people pulling these heists are recognizing that is going to be a thing. What is it going to be? Not everybody is going to live in the smart cities with the identifications.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, probably 70 or 80% of the people will just do whatever the government tells them to. But if 10 or 20% of the people set up an outside economy, it'll work.

## 2021 Year in Review

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi, interrupt at any moment here. This is the last show of the year. Without getting too detailed, is there anything that sticks out in your mind as phenomenally important? What are your thoughts on 2021?

**Georgi Dinkov:** Just horrifying in general?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. And the solutions are being hidden from all ends of the political spectrum. Everyone is being taught that the other end of the spectrum is out to get them. It's really only the one-hundredth of one percent which is out to get everyone else. The people that Hillary and Obama called the "deplorables," they are just as much ready for an actual solution and radical change as the people who think of themselves as the vanguard and most progressive.

**Georgi Dinkov:** When I was picking up packages, there was an art studio nearby. The woman invited me in, and her husband came, and we inevitably started talking about COVID. Both of them were in Mexico and had three vaccines—one from England, one from Israel. The husband reads research, but when we were talking, he had to put me in a partisan box. He had to label me as a Trump supporter to entertain anything I was saying, even though I told him I haven't voted since Bush/Kerry. He was unable to entertain any idea outside of partisan politics. He was from London and his wife was from Israel.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, the English are more obedient than Americans.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The thing I've been running into anytime I talk to a normal person about this is that coronavirus is so dangerous that *anything* is worth it. However tyrannical the implementation is, it's worth it because coronavirus is the most dangerous thing we've ever experienced in our lifetime.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, that really is it. People should just start looking at some of the facts. Have you heard any of Norman Fenton's talks about these statistics? He's a professor at Queen Mary University in London. All of his papers used to be published until he decided to look at the actual figures for mortality and what the virus is doing.

Anytime you look at the actual deaths from the so-called pandemic, what they did was simply rename influenza and several other major causes of seasonal death as COVID. It had the miraculous effect of ending death from influenza around the world for a couple of years. If you look at the figures for when there is a gigantic surge in deaths from COVID, there is a gigantic disappearance of deaths from influenza. Looking at that one fact coming out of the CDC and other government agencies, the only thing you can conclude is there never was a COVID pandemic. People have had coronavirus colds for hundreds of years, and that's all it is. It's renaming any respiratory-related sickness, and even all sorts of other things, as COVID just to create panic.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So I'm starting to question even the influenza. How did they know in the past, when we had the 60,000 to 80,000 deaths in the United States from the flu, that these were from the flu? They didn't test them with the PCR test.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Just a few years ago people asked that question, and the CDC said, well, it might not have really been 60,000 deaths this year, but it was at least 1,200 caused by the influenza virus.

**Georgi Dinkov:** How about we call them iatrogenic deaths? Because one thing is certain: these people died in the hospitals. Maybe that's all it is. Every year, we have at least 60,000 to 80,000 people dying in the hospital, showing up with respiratory symptoms, but ultimately they died in the care of these doctors. I don't know of many people who died from the flu at home.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. And once you see the terrible emptiness of the government figures regarding coronavirus, that might make you wonder: what about the other vaccines? Did the polio vaccine really cure polio, or did polio suddenly disappear to be replaced by almost identical numbers of Guillain-Barré paralysis and other paralytic diseases? The vaccine cured the *named* paralysis but didn't cure the incidence of paralytic disease.

## Gut Health and Paralysis

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think this Guillain-Barré syndrome has its origin in the gastrointestinal tract? Some kind of inflammatory reaction there?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. In the 1930s, a gastroenterologist was experimenting with distemper in dogs. He could give them an infection and then cut them open to see what was happening. In the early stages of the distemper sickness, where they classified it as a respiratory disease, all that was happening was a virus infection of the intestine. Reflexes from the intestine were causing the respiratory symptoms, but the respiratory tissues were absolutely free of virus at the peak of the disease. It was all intestinal infection causing reflex inflammation of the lungs and respiratory system. That seems to be how a lot of the viruses work. They first make your intestine permeable to bacteria and toxins, and then the sepsis triggers the inflammatory cytokine storm.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So this reflux pneumonia which they prepare for during surgery—they give people anti-acid drugs because they're afraid of reflux getting into the lungs—you're saying we can have this even without the surgery?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, there have been some very clear studies in which people who recover slowly from surgery, or who die following complications after surgery, are suffering because the stress of the surgery made their intestine permeable to the toxins that are not being suppressed by active digestion. If they clean their intestine for two or three days thoroughly with antibiotics before going into surgery, just about 100% of them have no surgical stress complications.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So I guess it would be a good regimen if somebody's about to have surgery, even if it's not abdominal, to sterilize the intestine anyway.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. Even if the doctors don't read the literature, the person should take laxatives, make sure their hormones are good, and have a very fibrous diet for several days before surgery to get a clean flow going through.

## Oat Bran and Fiber

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of fiber, I wanted to talk about oat bran. A long time ago, somebody asked you what the safest grains were, and I think you said masa harina, oats, and maybe one other thing. Is using oat bran an intestinal disinfectant, or is it a source of carbohydrate for you?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I read that a cup of the cooked oat bran is fairly filling, but it has only 88 calories, whereas regular oatmeal has maybe 250 for the same thing. So it does provide some carbohydrates, but it's strongly buffered by the presence of a higher fiber content. Studies in animals showed that over a long run, you might have to worry about some of the breakdown products of the soluble fibers having an estrogenic effect. But in the short run, up to a year or so, its effect is a matter of the bulk and acceleration of the intestines. It has an anti-estrogen effect for people who have been reabsorbing the estrogen that their liver tries to excrete.

**Danny Roddy:** Would you still use the carrot when you had oat bran in the morning?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. Occasionally someone has an oversensitive intestine and the carrot is too powerfully stimulating and can cause a headache or diarrhea. The oat bran is milder. Mushrooms are sort of in between; it depends on if you grind or chop them fairly fine. Bamboo shoots have a very high fiber content, so a little of it has a strong effect in helping to clean up your intestine.

**Danny Roddy:** I will say, oat bran as a breakfast, I really don't know much better than that. It takes a minute to make and even a fourth of a cup seems really filling.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, and if you put the right amount of butter and salt when you're cooking, it's extremely pleasant.

**Danny Roddy:** With milk.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, milk, butter, and sugar.

**Danny Roddy:** The whole internet knows this, but it contains phytic acid, so you'd want to have more calcium. If you made it with milk, do you think that would balance it out?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Some studies say that it just about negates the value of the milk you have with it. So you probably have to eat extra milk, more than you would think. Two quarts of milk will take care of just about anything.

## EMF, Grounding, and Metabolism

**Danny Roddy:** I just moved into a new place and I've been scanning my environment for things that might be inflammatory or toxic. If you were to move into a house with all the new technologies, what would be the first things you would deem as a huge problem and try to mitigate?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** If it has computer stuff, I would wire ethernet cable connections between all of the parts instead of Wi-Fi.

**Danny Roddy:** What about grounding equipment? I have a bunch of equipment on the desk right now. Should a person try to ground everything metal in their environment?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Check if you have a field meter. Check whether your monitor is putting out a big field. My Macintosh monitor had a huge field and was very hot, so I just bought a different monitor. I have a grounding pad, but it didn't affect the Macintosh monitor enough to bother with.

**Danny Roddy:** What's the more effective strategy: grounding every item, or is it more important for yourself to be grounded?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Only if it has big fields that you're sure are reaching out two or three feet beyond the monitor or your keyboard. But when you have things connected by wires, your general environment is much reduced.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned maybe four or five years ago about grounding a person's bed. Can you explain that?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** In Mexico, the temperature is good enough that you can walk barefoot outside anytime you feel like it. The daytime contact with the earth, I think, is enough to get you through the night without grounding. But you can get sheets and bedding that have copper wires woven into the fabric and a connection to put a wire to ground. Theoretically, that protects you considerably if you have 60-cycle or 50-cycle electricity in your environment.

**Danny Roddy:** What is the bioenergetic perspective of being grounded? What does that do?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** They talk about it as a buffer to the electrons that are being produced metabolically. If you take a piece of skin—people vary according to their metabolic rate and thyroid function—but you can put a piece of skin in a culture dish and it will keep projecting a static field into the surrounding space. If you put cyanide in the culture dish, stopping respiration, the electrical field collapses. Washing the cyanide out, the field comes back.

People are in effect bristling with their own static field. An "electret" is what you call it when it's established in wax or plastic. For a long time, they had electret needles for phonograph pickups. It was a piece of ceramic or plastic that had a static electrical field implanted as it was hardening. That polarized system of electrons projects the field permanently so that if you vibrate that piece of plastic, it creates an electrical current.

We, being a soft, flexible material, have to generate that structure and field momentarily by respiring. In an isolated environment, that could lead to influences backwards from our environment to our metabolism. Supposedly, if you ground yourself, that keeps the extraneous charges from interfering with your own biological generation of that electret-like static field.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So instead of grounding yourself, wouldn't taking a hefty dosage of quinones like methylene blue or vitamin K have a similar effect?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** That keeps you oxidizing it. That's protective internally, but the grounding people emphasize that it's protective to make sure you aren't being surrounded by the wrong kind of electrical charge.

**Danny Roddy:** Somebody on YouTube showed that when they were grounded, the EMF was less intense.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, I repeated those experiments and you can see the change. When I was doing electrical stimulation experiments, I tried to set up things to detect the internal electrical behavior of tissues and organisms. But I found that putting a strong detector on my animal, or my tissue, or myself, we got the rock music radio station. No matter what tissue we were trying to examine, the radio station was so powerful it was swamping all of the intrinsic biological signals.

Before I ever supplemented thyroid—I think it was 1976—I knew that I had the hypothyroid signs, the classical things, except that my metabolic rate was very high. Just at rest, I was burning about 4,000 calories. In a BMR test, I was 200-300% above normal oxygen consumption. That delayed me for several years from believing that I could be hypothyroid.

When I took thyroid, suddenly my metabolic energy went down towards normal. But in the few years before I took thyroid, being around lab instruments, I was able to see that high internal metabolism was causing me to have extremely exaggerated projection of charge fields around me. In the lab, where we had to use an electronic stimulator, if I reached towards it to adjust a knob, the machine would suddenly run off scale and go full force. As I pulled my hand away, it would go back, sort of like the Theremin music instrument. I had to always have my lab partner operate the machine because my hand made it malfunction. Even a cosmic ray cloud chamber... the ionization behavior of the humid atmosphere was cleared up by this field that extended about a foot and a half beyond my body.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the people who tend to get shocked very often for no apparent reason, is it fair to say that they have a very high rate of metabolism but the electrons are not getting paired properly with oxygen, so they build up and create this field?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, I think so.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So when you were taking thyroid, it lowered your stress hormones so your metabolic rate went down?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. I've seen it in three or four other men about the same age, usually in their 30s, who no matter how much they ate couldn't put on weight. They would often be 120 or 130 pounds for a standard height. But if they took thyroid, suddenly their ability to build muscle and fat with a normal amount of food was restored.

When you're hypothyroid, I think the mechanism is that your cells lose the ability to constantly retain magnesium. If the cells lose magnesium chronically, they run their energy apparatus constantly. The magnesium allows the ATP to accumulate. If you can't accumulate the ATP, you have to make it constantly. The thyroid supplement lets you retain the necessary magnesium to stabilize the ATP so you can turn off the production periodically.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So these people basically have upregulated glycolysis to produce the necessary ATP through the less efficient means if thyroid is not available.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, and that's where the symptoms and deterioration come in. It's very wasteful of food to have that happen.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about the people who put on weight too easily?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Just low thyroid is not running the machine fast enough.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Who is in a worse position: a person who puts on weight easily or cannot put on weight no matter how much they eat?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The people I've known, like myself, were very energetic and healthy, but they just couldn't put on weight no matter how much they ate.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But this is still stress metabolism, right? Because thyroid wasn't functioning properly.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Well, as long as it was able to use the energy and make ATP, it didn't have to resort to other sources to make ATP. In those hypermetabolic states, there's not necessarily any glycolysis going on.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What was keeping your metabolic rate so high if thyroid wasn't optimal?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think a diet that was heavy on phosphate, not enough calcium and magnesium. People experimenting with allergy patients found that active thyroid hormone let you retain magnesium. Without the T3, you could put the magnesium in and they would work perfectly for a few days, and then they would lose the magnesium. So taking a supplement of magnesium can temporarily moderate your metabolism so you don't have that hypermetabolic reaction to low thyroid.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But you have to keep taking it over and over because you lose it quickly without the ATP?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. The doctors experimenting on their patients found that just one or two intravenous doses was enough to work for a week, but then they could take it orally and keep their magnesium up and their allergies down.

**Danny Roddy:** In keeping with our non-toxic home theme, I emailed you about a home air purifier and you told me you had the Mystic Marvels device. What is a negative ion generator and why is it useful?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The majority of the careful studies have found that serotonin disposition is increased immediately by negative ions in the air. The lungs have the first access to the circulating platelets carrying serotonin produced by stress and inflammation. If your lungs need a boost of energy to detoxify that circulating serotonin, the electrons delivered on air ions participate directly in the monoamine oxidase (MAO) reaction to eliminate it. Some studies show that the blood level of serotonin is decreased as you have more ionized negative air.

**Danny Roddy:** So having that around you, especially in the evening time, would be a good way to not go extremely hypometabolic during the night.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. I think at very high altitude, the ultraviolet in the air is intense enough to give you a steady supply of negative ions.

## Altitude and Longevity

**Danny Roddy:** Some people email me studies showing that there's an increased risk of suicide at altitude. What do you think is responsible for that?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I looked at many of the countries around the world and that simply is a bad generalization. It probably has to do with socioeconomic conditions in Colorado, which they were looking at. But when you look at Bangladesh, Tibet, Colombia, and the low-lying Latin cultures, there's absolutely no correlation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In fact, the people living in the field have a much higher rate, right?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, generally the health is worse as your altitude is lower. Every thousand feet of altitude where you live decreases heart disease mortality, cancer mortality, and dementia.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned in some of your books about the extreme longevity in places like Azerbaijan and the Caucasus Mountains.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There is this guy, Muslimov. He lived in the former Soviet Union. He was an Azeri guy who had a passport showing that he was 160-some years old when he died. He lived at an altitude of about 1,800 meters. Do you think there are studies showing that even higher altitude, like in the Himalayas, leads to living longer?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** All the figures I've seen show that cancer and heart disease are consistently lower the higher you live. Osteoporosis is something very directly connected; your bones get stronger and teeth stay in longer.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the altitude is half of it and the other half is diet, because that guy who lived to 168 ate mostly milk and a little bit of bread.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, that area is a dairy area. They got plenty of milk and cheese.

## Progesterone and Hormones

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, any recent progesterone stories?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** No.

**Danny Roddy:** Did we talk about cycling the last time you were on? How imperative that was?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** For women, it's very important to the extent that their estrogen is still a problem. Even small amounts of estrogen, if continuous and not interrupted, are carcinogenic eventually. The cycling function of progesterone is to thoroughly knock out the estrogen influence and let the tissue gather itself together. It completely stops the carcinogenic estrogen cycle if you interrupt it properly.

But when you take progesterone steadily without the interruption, your liver interprets the constant high level of progesterone as being excessive. Anything your liver experiences at a high level, it produces enzymes to excrete. After two weeks, your liver has built up excretory enzymes that inactivate the progesterone. So after two weeks, the effect of a given dose is weaker. Stopping for at least a week lets your liver reset its threshold for excreting progesterone so you get more for your money.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If progesterone increases the amount of cytochrome P450 synthesized, isn't that in general a very good thing because you're going to be able to detox quite a few other substances?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, it does have a general cleaning up effect.

**Georgi Dinkov:** As far as the acceleration of the detox, wouldn't it be less of a problem if the person took it topically? Because it will avoid the first-pass metabolism.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** It doesn't get it on the first pass anyway. Progesterone and vitamin E, being perfectly soluble in the chylomicrons, bypass the liver many passes until it is all distributed into your fat tissue and brain. The chylomicrons are privileged to pass through the liver without giving up their progesterone. So there's no first-pass effect when you take progesterone in vitamin E.

**Danny Roddy:** When you told the pharmaceutical rep that, he was not very happy to hear that?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** That was DHEA, actually. I told him examples of how it worked for three hours or so all afternoon. And he said, "That's all very interesting, but that's not a good drug."

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of vitamin E, what is the vitamin K connection?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I extracted things from liver and various quinones. Putting them together, they formed a blackish-green oil, apparently an oxidation process. But putting that dark oil onto a paper chromatograph, as the solvent moves up the paper, it separated them back into the normal vitamin K and vitamin E colors. This showed there was only a charge transfer. But in the body, if you have a charge transfer circulating in your blood, that becomes extremely sensitive to environmental light effects.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So if a person is going to take vitamin K or vitamin E, they should take them away from each other, right?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, somewhat. Or not get exposed to bright sunlight or light for the next few hours.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is riboflavin (B2) also subject to the same restriction?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Oh, yes. Blue light or ultraviolet will destroy riboflavin and cause mutations and inflammation in your tissues where it happens. If you take a lot of riboflavin, you want to stay out of the sun for a while.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen the patents Pfizer filed on photodynamic therapy with methylene blue and red light? They claim specifically for cancer, instead of giving toxic drugs, they give methylene blue and irradiate you to generate reactive oxygen species.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's the same as most chemotherapies. They hope it's more specific to the cancer than to your brain cells, but it always kills a lot of your brain cells.

## COVID Variants and PCR

**Danny Roddy:** A lot of people are confused about the variants. David Martin said you could take the sequence of the coronavirus and just cut it off at different places and boom, you have a new variant. What is actually going on here?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The CDC just recently told the FDA that it could discontinue the use of PCR because it's meaningless. But the people who have been promoting it were completely ignorant about what a PCR is. When you use it to identify RNA, such as coronavirus, you have to make DNA from the RNA before you can run the PCR. The full name is Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction.

Almost no one advocating the test has any idea what goes on in multiplying the DNA. It's a manufacturing process that depends on the particular little stretch of DNA that you choose to amplify. You have to trust that the RNA sample was actually meaningfully connected to the virus, and then that you chose a sequence to multiply, and that in the process of increasing the amount of RNA, you were actually replicating that DNA and not some random background material.

They generally ran it at 40 cycles, where everyone recognized that beyond 25 cycles, you were getting so many false positives it was meaningless. So there's nothing about the PCR test that has been used honestly. It has very consistently been used fraudulently by the government agencies.

**Danny Roddy:** Obviously Omicron and Delta are just marketing campaigns.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Can the coronavirus mutate to the point where it becomes a completely different type, like a rhinovirus?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Very unlikely. Even under lab circumstances, it's hardly possible.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Wouldn't this mutation game eventually get exhausted? Is that why we're starting to see them hype up the avian viruses and swine flu again?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The normal evolution of the virus is to get weaker and weaker, so it has a better chance of surviving if it doesn't kill its host prematurely. To the extent that there is some knowledge about the Omicron version, it's very harmless, like a mild cold.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I heard you could get myocarditis from the Omicron variant.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, you can get it from any virus. If you Google that with influenza, you'll get at least 10 studies saying that flu can cause it as well.

## History of Medicine

**Danny Roddy:** Ivan Illich said, "Modern medicine is a negation of health. It isn't organized to serve human health, but only itself as an institution."

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, I've done some newsletters talking about the events in American medicine starting around 1850, when the American Medical Association decided to take over the world. They really were a very hostile group. Racially, they saw herbalists and other theories of healing as inferior people. Native Americans had some very effective techniques, but they connected it to racism. Black people were excluded, and the practical medicine brought from Africa was excluded.

What was left was what has been called allopathic medicine: the use of a single chemical to treat a single defined disease. It created an essentialist rather than an environmentalist approach to disease. Only the doctors were qualified to name the disease and prescribe the one specific chemical. It's a totally fraudulent, anti-scientific view.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Just to refresh my memory on essentialism—that's like immutable traits that can't change?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, that a gene is immortal, that our qualities are immortal. They created an imaginary embryological history of developing the gonads. They claimed to see something that can't be seen under the microscope. Until about the year 2000, biologists had complete faith in that cluster of assertions about immutability of traits—the Gregor Mendel theory of inheritance, which was essentially designed to counter Darwin and Lamarck and evolutionary thinking. Nothing evolves if you have eternal parts that are constantly coming back in different proportions.

## Listener Questions

**Danny Roddy:** Can you ask Ray: What is an electron? What do they look like?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** That's something that a good chemistry professor or biologist might actually consider. But the physics establishment insists that it's a matter of a verbal set of definitions. They won't tolerate questions on how to imagine in a realistic way what an electron is.

They say resonance is a matter between an electron and a nucleus. They don't want to have any images of the wave front of an electromagnetic field approaching the nucleus. A German researcher put a laser beam horizontally through a thin crystal inserted in the electron beam of an electron microscope. The electrons hitting the field shouldn't have done anything visible. But the color of the laser going perpendicularly through the crystal added a resonant frequency to supposedly a beam of pure electrons. The beam broke up into blue spots on the inert target area, showing that the laser energy was being absorbed by the electron *itself*, not an atom-electron system. That experiment represents something true about reality, but it totally undermines the official physics doctrine about what an electron is.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So is an electron essentially a standing wave in the neutrino sea?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, whatever that means. It's a wave object, not a point-like particle.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you ask him if he has heard of Walter Kilner? And if so, what he thinks about his use of dicyanin to observe the human aura?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I haven't heard of it.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you comment on the aura? Is that just an extension of these bioelectric fields?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I suspect that people are actually seeing that field. At the time I was having my very intense electrical fields, a psychic told my roommate that I had a very weird aura. When she went through the room, she seemed to be cringing, like she was avoiding heat coming off me.

**Danny Roddy:** What does Ray see in his mind when he thinks of the cell?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think of them as little personalities. Each cell has its field, and like Ortega y Gasset said of a person, "I am I and my circumstance." The cell is in the same situation. As soon as the circumstance changes, the cell is no longer what it was.

**Danny Roddy:** Can Dr. Peat elaborate on a bioenergetic view of sex determination during embryonic development?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Temperature and stress hormones. In fish, reptiles, and birds, the temperature is essential to developing the ratio.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the high ratio of females to males is nature's protective mechanism? If the environment is not good, it's better to have more females than males because one male can ensure continuation.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, I think so.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The recent statistics showing a lot more girls are being born... could it be a sign that conditions are deteriorating?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** That sounds very reasonable.

**Georgi Dinkov:** That IQ drop of kids born in 2020—is this going to result in a profoundly stupid society?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Have you read Ernest Sternglass? He studied the effects of radiation on miscarriages. He showed that at the peak of atmospheric contamination from the 1963 bomb testing, 18 years later, the academic scores went down. He showed very clearly that the greatest decrease was in the highest scoring category. It knocked out the exceptionally competent kids of that age.

**Danny Roddy:** Are Sheldrake's morphic fields and Vernadsky's Noosphere the same thing?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, they could be. Vernadsky was very optimistic at the ending of the Second World War. He said he was confident the world would find a way out of it by increasing its metabolic rate, accumulating carbon dioxide, warming things up, making brains get bigger, and making plants grow faster. The Noosphere idea is that we're all headed in that direction just because of the nature of the universe.

**Danny Roddy:** If a counterculture painting movement was to start today, what themes or styles would Ray like to see?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think a little of the realism of Frans Hals. Perceiving interesting things in people. Frans Hals was very confident at capturing instantaneous things that represented much more of the person than a photograph would have.

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray think starch is responsible for a change in personality towards war and conquer?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** It goes with malnutrition. The high starch diets end up tending to be deficient in some of the essential nutrients. High phosphate and stress-inducing things make people irritable and authoritarian.

**Danny Roddy:** What is the cost of getting drunk occasionally—like blackout drunk—on your health and longevity?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think it's very stressful to lose consciousness. It greatly depletes your liver glycogen and takes multiple days to recover.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Wouldn't taking a hefty dose of progesterone largely replicate the effects of getting drunk?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** It increases your ability to store glycogen, so it doesn't have any long-term negative effects. But when I accidentally overdosed on it, the coordination of my hands and feet was impossible for a while. When I deliberately took a very large amount because I had a bad migraine, I went with the euphoria, simply went to sleep in about two minutes, and had no more headache.

## 2022 Predictions

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, people hate when I ask you to speculate, but what do you think we're in store for in 2022?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think the resistors are going to put up more and more resistance. But Bill Gates has already said that people are working on a vaccine for the Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus, which is similar to the Ebola virus and kills up to 90% of the people it infects. He says that is likely to be the next epidemic. Since they are about ready to have a vaccine for it, I think he might be right. As soon as a vaccine is able to come to market at a profit of half a trillion dollars, then we can have the Marburg epidemic.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But if this Marburg virus is so deadly, just like Ebola, then it can't really be a pandemic because it's going to kill most of the hosts before it has a chance to spread, right?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** It's just scarier. That's all that's needed to have a vaccine that is going to save everyone. All it has to do is kill a few dozen people, and then they can sell a trillion dollars worth of vaccines.

**Georgi Dinkov:** It'll probably be much easier to mandate because they'll say, "Look, this is truly deadly, don't resist."

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. Since so many people have caught on and don't want the vaccine, and realize that vaccine mortality goes up the first month after being vaccinated, they need something to really scare people. Show people bleeding out of their eyes and ears—a real horror show.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, stay on the line. Guys, thank you so much for hanging out. Sincerely appreciate this year. Other than being a total horror show, I've had fun doing this podcast. Georgi and Ray, you guys always make it really special.
