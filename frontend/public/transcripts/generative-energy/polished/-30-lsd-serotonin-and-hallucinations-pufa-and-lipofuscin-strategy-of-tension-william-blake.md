# Generative Energy Podcast: Science, Society, and Bioenergetics

## Introduction and Scientific Nobel Prizes

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, we're live. Georgi Dinkov, Raymond Peat, thank you guys so much for joining us. Georgi, go back to your question. I won't interfere. Go ahead.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I want to expand on what we've been discussing. Aside from Otto Warburg, Szent-Györgyi, and I guess Ilya Prigogine, do you know of any other scientists who got the Nobel Prize for actually humanistic work—work that expanded knowledge and science for the benefit of humanity? Or does it seem to be mostly awarded for pathological ideas these days?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Metchnikoff.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Metchnikoff, okay. But you can count these people on one hand across a hundred years. This means a very small minority of good awards, with the vast majority being mostly pathological discoveries.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and Metchnikoff shared his with Paul Ehrlich, who represented the business monopoly and chemical monopoly world.

## HIV, Montagnier, and Scientific Censorship

**Georgi Dinkov:** Right. Are you familiar with the work of Luc Montagnier, the co-discoverer of HIV?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I've followed it in detail, on and off since about 1980.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you noticed that he's become a pariah in the scientific community? He started talking about HIV not being as dangerous unless you have a bad lifestyle and low metabolism. He's talking about curing autism with antibiotics, which of course implicates serotonin. This guy used to be the director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and now he is essentially in hiding. Everyone says he's insane.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Much later, when Peter Duesberg questioned the virus-gene connection in cancer, money began flowing from the government into cancer research. Then Duesberg said, "Wait a minute, I was mistaken there," and went on to other work. As long as he stayed out of directly interfering with the funding of the nonsense oncogene virus work, he continued his research.

But when he questioned whether the HIV retrovirus caused AIDS, that was the last straw. Even the other professors at the university told graduate students not to attend his seminars or courses, and the NIH cut off funding. All of the science organizations stopped inviting him because he was a risk for asking embarrassing questions. Have you heard Kary Mullis talk about Luc Montagnier and Peter Duesberg?

**Georgi Dinkov:** No, I haven't.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mullis was a hyperactive kid who went into science and didn't let his intelligence be ruined by getting trained in science. He continued to look at evidence and ask questions. Once, he went up to Montagnier at a meeting and said he needed a reference for the statement, "HIV is the probable cause of AIDS." Montagnier referred him to the declaration by the NIH that it is the cause. Mullis said, "Well, but there was no evidence mentioned there."

Montagnier said, "Well, recently someone showed that by treating a retrovirus in a certain way, you could get it to kill chimpanzees a week after you inject it." Mullis pointed out that that has nothing to do with a deficiency syndrome. He said Montagnier just walked away—no more questions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Well, it's becoming too dangerous for him to speak, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but then 30 years later, the science world turned away from him.

## Biological Resonance and Viral Replication

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen some of his other work on bacteria and DNA emitting electromagnetic waves and changing the structure of water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't looked closely at how they pick up the signals and analyze it, but they say they're getting signals—sort of an echo in the water. If people don't have a challenge, you have to approximate the measuring system before you can say it simply doesn't exist.

**Georgi Dinkov:** He was actually able to replicate the HIV virus across two different containers of serum. The second one didn't have any trace of the virus, confirmed by a PCR test. But if the second container was in close proximity to the one that contained the virus, and both were in a resonating field of the Schumann resonance frequency (between six and 10 Hertz), then apparently after about 12 hours, the second container was able to fully replicate the virus if given the starting materials—like RNA and DNA polymerase.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That sort of thing has been around since about 1940. Someone was adding proteins to different types of cells and finding that the cell could replicate and the offspring would still contain that protein for several generations. One of these studies showed that with extreme techniques for removing any contaminating protein, the amount of protein coming out of the cell would be thousands of times greater than the amount the cell had been exposed to. This was very clear evidence that on a single exposure, a human cell could absorb, copy, and produce unlimited quantities of a foreign protein. This means it had not only copied DNA, it had translated the protein into RNA or DNA, and then used the nucleic acid to produce endless quantities of that protein.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Here's a fascinating follow-up question. We, as bodies, are essentially bigger replicas of these containers Montagnier was using. If two people—one HIV positive or carrying any pathogen—are in close proximity for a long time, and we are all bathing in Schumann resonance, wouldn't that imply we could replicate the infection into a healthy person without any physical pathogen exchange?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it works the other way: a healthy person is going to give the sick person a boost to eradicate the problem. I think that's how life has been working all along. It's not just a little particle of new DNA created to make them immune to something in the environment. Whether it requires passing a chunk of DNA or simply the information needed to make the DNA protein, I think the protective healing effect is likely to be predominant unless the whole system is so sick that it's on the way to dying as a whole.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So would you say it's an averaging effect? If you have a community where three are healthy and two are sick, does the whole community tend toward an average?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there's a ratchet on it in the direction of surviving healthy and superior individuals. It requires a sickness of the whole community before you get regression.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The reason I ask is that you've said we should surround ourselves with healthy, positively-minded people. If healthy people pull the sick toward health, is there a danger if we are surrounded by sick, negatively-minded people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have a geographic area where sick people have accumulated because of cultural habits like drug use, you can have such a sick environment that it would take a big infusion of healthy people to change it. There would be social and political conflict. You have to look at the number of people supporting an unhealthy culture—running around obediently wearing masks and behaving stupidly. It reaches a point where it feels like it's bad for one's health.

## Social Control and "TSA-ification" of Life

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of that, we traveled from a smaller town to Chiang Mai, a bigger city in Thailand. To get to the grocery store, you have to go into a mall, scan a QR code, wash your hands, get temperature checked, and go through a thermal scanner. Then there are people watching from each level of the mall. It’s definitely hitting a reality check point of total insanity. I didn't wear my mask—or took it off—and a woman chased me through the store to tell me to put it back on. It feels like the "TSA-ification" of daily tasks.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even when people are alone, walking down the street with no one within 200 feet, wearing a mask in hot weather... they obviously suffer. It is pitiful to see such terrible obedience.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Well, don't worry, Ray, because apparently the experts say that protests of up to 100 people are okay, but social outdoor gatherings are limited to 12. Is the population so dumbed down? It’s an obvious showing of the hand because it's so absurd. What do you think the point of putting this stuff out through the news is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That thing about the 100 people allowed to protest shows that if people just ignore them, they'll change their rules so that they seem to be in control.

## Racism, Classism, and Civil Unrest

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, since you have a broad view of these things, what is your general perception of how racial tensions get stoked?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I took a couple of trips into and through the Southern states in 1960 and 1964. Even though I thought of myself as a white person, I was seen by the natives as at least as dangerous as a black person. I narrowly escaped getting killed a couple of times. I stayed away for about 30 years. I saw it as the worst sort of sadistic xenophobia. I can see why black people would shuffle and say "Yes" if they thought that would save them. But something about my face or manner made them want to kill me.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you go into that a little more? Was it your appearance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It must have been that I had an out-of-state driver's license, fat sideburns, and probably dressed in an unconventional way. You could see the hatred emanating when I would stop at a gas station. It was a general culture of total obedience to some mysterious standard of being.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the protests going on right now are actually achieving anything? Or is it similar to the MLK movement where no fundamental change is really happening?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They aren't really doing anything threatening to the system. Getting city council people to say they'll defund the police—what does that mean? That the police will privatize and be autonomous? Somehow the whole system has to be broken up. Crime has to be recognized when it's committed by police. But the Nazis and Klansmen have infiltrated many of the police departments. There is organized racism and classism, wanting to kill homeless people as well as black people.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You’ve said before that Occupy Wall Street could have been the real party for the majority, but it got infiltrated. Do you see something similar happening with Black Lives Matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, by avoiding the general class question and making it too narrow. A lot of the people that voted for Trump had a mistaken understanding about what class is and what really threatens them. Those people should be incorporated into a reform that eliminates crime in all directions, but especially obliterates the organized crime of the police forces.

**Danny Roddy:** The dominant narrative right now is "white privilege," "white guilt," and "white fragility." It seems odd that the narrative is that "white people" are responsible for all the problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When Martin Luther King began emphasizing the problems of white people and made it a class issue rather than a racial one, almost immediately that was when he got killed.

**Danny Roddy:** How is racism used to occupy the minds of people in favor of not thinking about class? How would you define class?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Simply not possessing property, not having social power and privilege above the middle income. The lower half of the population should realize they are in the lower class, but they've been taught to call everyone down to about $15,000 a year "middle class."

What's happening now with the pandemic is clearly designed to destroy all those people who have thought of themselves as the middle class. As the unemployment rate goes up, small and medium-sized businesses are failing. If traditional cyclic unemployment caused deaths by suicide and drugs, imagine what the destruction of all these businesses will do. It will be killing millions of people.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Isn't this playing with fire on behalf of the powers that be? A lot of people in this country are armed. If you push them into a corner, won't they revolt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people causing their problems have tremendous security forces. People like Fauci—you can't even get close to them. They aren't subject to force of that sort. They don't have anyone to shoot, despite how many guns they have. They're infinitely outgunned. So that sort of revolt is worse than useless.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you expect a large-scale collapse in the US in the next few years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I can't see how it can do anything but get worse until maybe five or ten million people start rejecting orders. That might cause a movement that could save the whole country.

## Geopolitics: The US vs. China

**Georgi Dinkov:** What is the end game here? You said before it's a streamlined economy to compete with China.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, bringing the empire rapidly to absolute world control. China is the massive impediment to that. They see China prepared to do a better job of automating everything. So they want to hurt all the economies and be the only ones who reach automation through artificial intelligence. They use fear—currently viruses—to control people.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think China jumped on this as an opportunity as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think part of that is sophistication. Very few people are talking about the germ warfare aspect. It briefly came out in February or March, each side accusing the other. But anyone who knows history knows the US has been in that business for the whole 20th century. China doesn't want to get in that competition.

**Danny Roddy:** It seems there is tension specifically between the US and China to maintain the dominant empire?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** China's population is so huge relative to the US. The real drift of history is strongly in the direction of China. Now that they've got an efficient economy and a unified government, the population is almost a determinant of the outcome. Extraordinary measures are needed to change that trend of history.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the population is the determining factor, wouldn't it make sense for the US to prop up its own population instead of decimating it? Or does the empire not care about the US as a country?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The industry went to China, so most Americans are useless in the sense of producing profit for the financial class. They aren't going to lose anything if millions of middle and lower-class Americans start dying off. Their income is going to accelerate for quite a while in proportion to the die-off. It's international capital.

## Philosophy, The Elite, and William Blake

**Danny Roddy:** I got requests to talk about the esoteric part of the elite—images like Jacob Rothschild with Marina Abramovic. Is there an element of mysticism or Luciferianism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's worse than any of the Christian heresies or demonisms. It is the belief that they can encode reality—that reality is computable and controllable by defining it as quantized, digitizable units. It is an absolute mentalism or idealism. They assert that reality is, at base, nothing but symbols.

It started being the explicit language in the 1930s. By the 1950s, it had become a religion. People like Norbert Wiener and Vannevar Bush, who believed in an analog approach to cybernetics where in-betweens exist and are meaningful, were written out of science. Meanwhile, Noam Chomsky represented the vanguard of this mentalistic view, claiming language could be dealt with objectively as particles connected to genes. Everything is abstract inference from symbols to symbols, eliminating continuity and meaning.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So they realized computers are powerless at emulating human intelligence, so they decided to make people behave like computers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly right. It's authoritarianism put into an ideology of idealism.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding William Blake—you mentioned teaching students who gave bizarre answers about his poetry. What do you think Blake meant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blake ironically used the language of the angels, by whom he meant satanic powers. He said that trickery and imposed meanings were used to enslave people. "Horses of instruction" meant that horses are enslaved and learn their lessons—analogous to people who are obedient.

**Georgi Dinkov:** My understanding is he was highly critical of traditional Christianity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't see that the "angels" are Satan (in the sense of evil) and that the "devils" are the oppressed who have the potential to rebel and save life, you miss the point. Like the Clod and the Pebble. The Clod obediently accepts that God is in heaven, and gets trampled. The Pebble is tough, resistant, and takes care of himself.

## LSD, Serotonin, and Consciousness

**Danny Roddy:** Is there a relationship between hallucinations and serotonin? Are hallucinations separate from the drug's effects on the serotonin system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The accumulating evidence for the first 15 years was clear that LSD was a simple anti-serotonin action. Serotonin in overdose can make you crazy and hallucinate, but it's a misery experience. Small amounts of LSD are protective against serotonin. Stress poisons you with serotonin and increases your tendency to be obedient. A little bit of LSD, by blocking serotonin, can open a person up and get them out of this digitized world.

**Danny Roddy:** If the culture increases serotonin, and serotonin influences visual perception, are things seen on LSD more real than day-to-day sight?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very often they are. The drug industry wanted to promote serotonin and tryptophan, so they claimed LSD makes you insane because it blocks serotonin. But serotonin is really a stress emergency signal.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about studies showing selective serotonin antagonists like cyproheptadine can prevent the hallucination trip? Doesn't that imply the trip is connected to the serotonin system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think some hallucination experiences come from the overdose effect of LSD acting like ergot and serotonin—constricting blood vessels in the brain, shutting off energy production, leading to distortion rather than opening.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the hallucinations are not necessary for the positive effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not at all. They're a harmful side effect. The range of 10 to 20 micrograms is adequate for expanding consciousness.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You said consciousness extends in space and time. Is it accurate to imagine consciousness like waves in a lake—the totality of those waves, not just the point of impact?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Consciousness isn't in your head. It's never in your head if you're conscious.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you touch on that? A lot of people describe a frontal sensation of presence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Feeling being is a complex, changing thing. Your body, as it approaches other beings, feels a connection from your heart and solar plexus. I think those are actual radiation-like experiences. When you feel you're interacting through those nerve centers, you are in reality interacting. The frown of an authority figure will cause your solar plexus to shrink and cut you off from others.

## Resonance and Sheldrake

**Georgi Dinkov:** Rupert Sheldrake talks about morphic resonance fields. What are these fields composed of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Horace Dudley's work intrigued me. He believed the neutrino sea is fundamental—the sub-quantic medium. I prefer that idea over just electromagnetic waves.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Regarding Sheldrake's idea of collective memory in groups—why would this be limited to a specific culture? Why not a universal field?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think interaction has a tuning effect. People are embedded in authoritarian culture which suppresses biological connectedness. Small groups can create a private culture that gives them freedom from the big authoritarian process.

## Diet and Ethics

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does the moral argument of vegans not wanting to eat sentient beings have credibility?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Of course. When you look at food cosmically—the flow of energy—the safest nutrition for long life and clear consciousness happens to be fruit and milk. Milk purifies nutrients. Fruit is designed to nourish its seeds or feed an animal to distribute them. The body of the fruit is a positive thing in the cosmic flow.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about eggs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Less ideal, but still no sentient process has developed.

## Bioenergetics: PUFA, Fats, and Supplements

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, there is a quote attributed to you: "By the time a person is 30, they have enough PUFA to last a lifetime." Is that accurate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That seems to presume there's some use for polyunsaturated fat. I see them as harmful right from the start. As soon as breastfeeding stops or if they use formula with added PUFA, the brain starts assimilating it. It accumulates, slowing metabolism. By age 30 or 40, it reaches the point of causing aging symptoms and a cold brain.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If saturated fat gets preferentially oxidized while PUFA gets stored, is it difficult to change fatty acid composition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Under stress, PUFA comes out preferentially and becomes toxic. To displace it, longer chain saturated fatty acids like palmitic and stearic acid seem better because they get absorbed through the lymphatic system to the tissues. Shorter chains like coconut oil go to the liver.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you remember the old Vitamin E studies regarding stamina?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they found crude Vitamin E increased stamina, but it was actually the very long-chain saturated fats (waxy material) associated with it, not the Vitamin E itself. These are the policosanols.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding the ketone body ratio—proponents say fasting and ketosis increase NAD relative to NADH.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All the best biochemists showed that diabetes and fasting cause extreme reduction of NADH rather than NAD—a shift towards cancer physiology. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is called a ketone body, but it's not a ketone; it shifts cell balance the same way lactic acid does. It's a reductant.

**Danny Roddy:** The parathyroid calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is a moment-to-moment thing, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. High phosphate turns on the parathyroid hormone (PTH). A high calcium diet with Vitamin D energizes thyroid function because it gets you out of that PTH/inflammatory state.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about studies showing high Vitamin D causes calcification?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of them confuse 1,25-hydroxy (active) with 25-hydroxy (storage). The 25-hydroxy supports Klotho (the anti-aging protein). The 1,25-hydroxy—the so-called active Vitamin D—knocks down Klotho and raises PTH. The toxic effects are done by the activated Vitamin D. Taking the precursor (cholecalciferol) lowers the risk because it suppresses the activation in the kidneys.

**Danny Roddy:** Cortisol is made from progesterone but doesn't increase it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Think of the connections like a rope. If there's a deficiency, it pulls the precursor. You can't push the rope. Taking progesterone won't force cortisol production; it satisfies the need.

**Danny Roddy:** What about the Progesterone/DHEA ratio?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A 30-year-old taking 10mg of DHEA is likely to produce too much estrogen if they are slightly hypothyroid. Progesterone helps activate the thyroid and reduce aromatase.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've been looking for the study where rats were fed a cup of pregnenolone a day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw it in a book published around 1950 edited by Abraham White.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Regarding lipofuscin—can long-chain fats displace it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In nerve cells, they found ethanol worked almost as well as Vitamin E in dissolving lipofuscin. A tiny amount of ethanol vapor is a powerful anti-free radical agent. Years ago, I saw people with "fried" skin from age pigment take progesterone, and it cleared up. Progesterone suppresses estrogen and shifts the balance toward elimination.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What is your opinion on steroidal aromatase inhibitors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have side effects. It's better to use natural anti-aromatase agents like progesterone or thyroid.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm thinking about how education is going to be affected by the lockdown mentality—converting from real education to digital indoctrination. Some thought needs to be given to how actual living education might be protected.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, thank you so much. Georgi Dinkov, thank you. We'll be back next month.
