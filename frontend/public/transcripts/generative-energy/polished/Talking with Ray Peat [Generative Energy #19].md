---# Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy, and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, and biologist, Raymond Peat. In this hour-long episode, we'll talk about Ray's interest in nutrition, the lead-up to writing his 1973 book, *Nutrition for Women*, and his latest newsletter, "Mushrooms, Observations, and Interpretations."

I wanted to start with your interest in nutrition and end up at recipes. I was trying to put a timeline together of when you graduated with your degree in linguistics and then Blake College.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got my bachelor's degree at Southern Oregon College in 1956. Then I worked in the woods for a while and got a job teaching. First, I studied at the University of Oregon in 1957 and '58, starting in the English department, then switched to philosophy and psychology. After about one or two terms in each department, I decided I couldn't stay to finish a master's in that area. I even tried art history.

During this time, I was looking around for some program that would let me integrate all of these areas. It looked like linguistics would allow me to bring together what the brain is doing when it speaks and thinks. Every time you reach a word that seems appropriate, you're putting that word into a new context that never existed before. So really, every act of communication is a creative invention. It seemed to me that the approach to how consciousness works would be possible through analyzing language.

I found that Ohio State University had a PhD program called the Interdepartmental Linguistics Committee that would grant a PhD on the basis of interdepartmental language studies. Since that seemed just what I wanted to do, I applied there and looked for a job to support myself nearby.

I found a little Swedenborgian college called Urbana University, founded in 1859. They had a really good hundred-year-old library. I enrolled in English, Russian, and philosophy department courses there, but did most of my studying and thinking at Urbana College.

## Teaching Biology and Radiation Concerns

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What I was teaching at Urbana was introduction to biology intended for physics majors. The president of the college said he wanted a non-technical approach to the subject to let the students understand current magazine and newspaper articles in their field. At that time, 1959 and '60, the most interesting current science topics were the biological effects of radioactive fallout from atmospheric bomb testing and the development of computers.

So, I built the course largely around how to interpret the biological effects of radiation in the most general sense, and how information works in the organism analogous to how information is handled in computers.

Because of the physics part of my courses, a conservative priest who was head of the board of directors didn't like the students asking questions about how safe atmospheric bomb testing was. They went looking for a new biology teacher. They had Leo Koch come in from the University of Illinois as a prospective replacement for me. He chose to give his lecture at Urbana on the dangers of radiation and the biological effects of atmospheric bomb testing. So, he was discarded as a possible replacement. Within a week or two, he lost his job at the University of Illinois too.

I realized that even though they hadn't told me I wasn't going to have a job the next year, when he wasn't hired—and in fact got fired at Illinois—I would have to look for another job. That started me thinking about organizing a college that would be run by the students and teachers jointly without any priests or boards of directors.

**Danny Roddy:** To try to understand your orientation, had you already read Szent-Györgyi and were you familiar with Otto Warburg? What was the tip-off that radiation was something that was really harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. I had been reading for seven or eight years. Actually, it started in 1947 or '48; people were circulating mimeographed pamphlets pointing out the age acceleration of any kind of ionizing radiation. So that had been in my mind for a good 12 years.

Linus Pauling was in the news as opposing the bomb testing. That was why they took away his passport, so he couldn't get outside the U.S. to talk to other people about it. He was strongly influenced by Szent-Györgyi. I think it was through Linus Pauling's writings that I got interested in Szent-Györgyi.

I think it was about 1950 that Szent-Györgyi was traveling around the country doing his demonstrations. He had a stroboscopic arrangement in which he could flash an ultraviolet light, cut off the flash, and reveal the fluorescent delay. He was demonstrating the effect of the living state versus the frozen state on electronic behavior.

Between 1959 and '60, Linus Pauling started explaining anesthesia on the basis of structuring water. Under pressure, even nitrogen causes anesthesia, but the heavy noble gases at moderate pressure will cause shutting off of nerve activity without harming the cell. There's no chemical reaction involved. Szent-Györgyi was saying that this probably explains all anesthetics. The hydrophobic molecules that aren't noble gases are likewise not chemically interacting with the cells or the water; they were simply offering a surface changing the crystalline properties of the water. He gave a clathrate analogy.

That was part of how I was interpreting the toxic effects of radiation: by affecting this interaction between the electron state of molecules and the water structure. Linus Pauling was talking about the dangers of high-energy radiation going directly into the chemical bond of DNA. I was thinking about it in terms of Szent-Györgyi's very subtle effects on the electronic state—stabilizing a higher energy state of electrons when the water is organized. I was more extreme in my concerns about radiation even than Linus Pauling was.

## Blake College and CIA Interference

**Danny Roddy:** When you left Ohio with the idea of starting Blake College, you were around 25 or 26?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Since Leo Koch didn't have a job either, he was on a lecture tour about academic freedom. In his talks, he would say, "We're starting a college that won't be susceptible to censorship." He gathered up some interested students.

I found that California would let us grant degrees if we had $50,000 invested. But they wouldn't let us even acknowledge that a student had studied with us if we didn't have the money put up. I found that was the rule in all of the states I contacted. The Assistant Secretary of Public Instruction at Oregon told me, "It doesn't matter what students know."

I decided to set it up in Mexico City because of the peso difference and the political difference. They had a secular government at that time and would approve of any science-based curriculum as long as you kept the church out of it.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that when Madalyn Murray O'Hair was involved?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. My parents sent me an article about her being persecuted by the Maryland police. It said that she and her old mother had assaulted a group of cops and caused one to have a heart attack. It sounded so ridiculous that she could beat up the cops that had come to arrest her. Everyone assumed she was being persecuted. She fled to Hawaii.

My girlfriend at Blake College took pity on her. I wrote to her and asked if she wanted to be a teacher at Blake College. Madalyn said yes, but asked for help with transportation. My girlfriend Cheryl went to San Francisco, bought an old car, and Madalyn put on a nun's habit and got out of Hawaii dressed as a nun.

**Danny Roddy:** By that time were you totally into nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reading Adelle Davis in the 50s was what really influenced me. A friend of mine in Mexico City said that his niece, 18 months old, was in the hospital with intractable diarrhea. I told him about Adelle Davis' experience with vitamin B6. I happened to have a bottle with me and gave him a 10-milligram tablet. On the third or fourth day, when the doctor said she wouldn't last more than another day, he gave her 10 milligrams of vitamin B6. Within an hour or so the dysentery stopped and she completely recovered. That was my first experience with Adelle Davis' suggestions and it impressed me.

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to ask about the interference you faced. Was it because of Blake College, Madalyn, or both?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The U.S. was basically occupying Mexico during this period, continuing all of the intelligence agencies: Naval intelligence, military intelligence, CIA, FBI. Just a couple of weeks after opening the school in Mexico City, the cultural attaché of the embassy came to visit. He asked, "Since you're a graduate student in linguistics, why aren't you with the Summer Institute of Linguistics?" I said I wasn't interested in Bible translations. The Summer Institute for Linguistics was basically a CIA front to subdue the native populations of Central and South America.

Around the time of the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, a man in an American uniform—which was illegal in Mexico at that time—came to our new location in Valle de Bravo. He identified himself as the military attaché of the embassy. He had private interviews with me and each of the students, asking us what our opinion was about the war in Vietnam.

**Danny Roddy:** Were you freaked out at all the attention, or did you expect it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wasn't aware of how totally covered with US intelligence agents Mexico was at that time. Madalyn Murray had a very organized thing working with the embassy to time the takeover for when I was going to be on the road driving to the US for a job in Montana. She was having a report given to the embassy, the federal police of Mexico, and the English-speaking newspapers about what was going on at Blake College.

They basically framed the college to look like some kind of drug lab. For example, the landlady had a German Shepherd with an ear infection. One of the students, who knew about injecting things, gave the dog a shot of penicillin and cured the ear. The students organized under Madalyn told her that story, and she turned it into "drug orgies," giving morphine even to the dog.

Alejandro Jodorowsky, the filmmaker, came to visit. He organized the maids' children into a "Panic Theater" thing where they played clay flutes. The police confiscated the tape recording of his flute music and claimed it was part of the drug orgies.

Just before I reached the Mexican border, an old unshaven guy with a striped shopping bag imposed himself on me for a ride. As we drove, we talked politics and were absolutely sympathetic. When we came to the border checkpoint, the soldier asked for his ID. He said, "I'm just an ignorant peasant." The soldier let us go. As we pulled away, my passenger said, "That guy ought to be fired," reached in his bag, and pulled out his ID showing he was a federal police agent. He had been there to make sure I got out of the country because the federal police had arrested all the students and teachers back at the college.

**Danny Roddy:** Why did they let you go?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the teachers was a friend of the daughter of the Mayo Clinic people. The Mayo Clinic had a team of lawyers arrive on their private jet to talk to the president. The students were immediately let out and sent to the border.

## Ray's Health History and Metabolism

**Danny Roddy:** I read about your own health journey. A major discovery of yours was pregnenolone and vitamin E. Was that before you wrote *Nutrition for Women* in 1973?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that was after. *Nutrition for Women* started when I was talking to a girlfriend about how hormones interact with nutrients. She said this ought to be more widely available, so I started writing up little short bits.

**Danny Roddy:** The idea of oxidative metabolism reinforcing structure and vice versa—was that obvious to you early on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was nine or ten, I had been having periodic migraines. I became nearsighted and noticed that some of my classmates—girls who were nearsighted—also had migraines. I saw that it was not only myopia and migraines, but that these girls were often hypothyroid. So for many years, I considered whether I was hypothyroid.

However, when I was 16 and worked in the woods, people joked that my lunch weighed five pounds. I calculated that I was eating something like 10,000 calories a day while weighing 160 pounds. So, I was convinced I couldn't be hypothyroid.

**Danny Roddy:** Did you think the hyperthyroid state was the result of adrenaline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think of it as metabolic inefficiency. I evaporated water many times faster than other people. When I worked on a surveying crew, I would refill two canteens every hour. I found that I couldn't urinate from breakfast until after supper, even though I had drunk typically 12 liters of water during the day. I was easily metabolizing 10,000 or 12,000 calories per day. It was inefficient, wasteful youth metabolism.

When I first tried thyroid—for some odd reasoning, despite being so hypermetabolic—suddenly my metabolism slowed down, became more efficient, and I could be comfortable on 3,000 or 4,000 calories a day. That was 1976.

**Danny Roddy:** When did the pregnenolone discovery happen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1983, I started having migraine equivalents—artery inflammation and throbbing inside my mouth, nose, or beside my eye. Thyroid wasn't enough.

I had a bottle of vitamin E that I had used to try and dissolve pregnenolone. It didn't seem to dissolve much, so the powder was sitting at the bottom. When I took that, thinking it was just vitamin E, I was in perfect health. But then I went on a trip and took a different vitamin E supply. I got sick with the migraine equivalent. When I got back, I realized the difference was the bottle. I took a dab of pregnenolone, and the pain stopped within several minutes. That was 1984. I immediately began taking pregnenolone and the symptoms never recurred.

## Unsaturated Fats and Diet Evolution

**Danny Roddy:** Were you always thinking about unsaturated fats and their connection with pregnenolone and thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In *Nutrition Reviews*, probably in the early 70s, there was an experiment feeding rats different quantities and proportions of saturated and fatty acids. The unsaturated fatty acids produced obesity over a lifetime regardless of the quantity, and the saturated fats produced leanness regardless of the quantity. That convinced me it was acting on the oxidative system, the same thing thyroid works on.

In my estrogen research for my dissertation, I had seen studies from the 1940s showing that polyunsaturated fats were causing both testicular and brain degeneration, and that vitamin E was an anti-estrogen as well as protecting against that degeneration.

**Danny Roddy:** The foods you originally thought of as constructing a good diet—was that originally for low-income people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was in Mexico, I saw the effects of extreme malnutrition. I found that eggs, milk, and wheat germ were a good way to get protein and vitamins. However, the wheat germ gave me a terrific calcium deficiency and extreme temperature sensitivity in my teeth, which went away when I took a huge calcium supplement.

In 1962, thinking about how to economize on food—getting a survival diet for maybe $15 a month—potatoes turned out to be one of the best answers. Potatoes and milk. Later, I saw that if you combined orange juice with eggs in sufficient quantity, you could get both your calories and all essential nutrients.

## Mushrooms and Immunity

**Danny Roddy:** One of the things I love about your most recent newsletter is that you didn't usually recommend mushrooms, but then you basically changed your mind based on empiricism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the 1970s, I had been a mushroom lover. But then I saw articles by Bela Toth showing there were liver toxins in all of the mushrooms. He didn't mention that they were destroyed by heat, but I was so impressed by the ubiquity of liver toxicity and carcinogenicity that I stopped eating them.

**Danny Roddy:** What brought you back to them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The immune function. They are like an animal turned inside out as far as immunity goes. We live with rotten stuff on the inside (in our intestine), and they live embedded in rotting stuff. They have to have mechanisms that allow them not to be destroyed by toxins and pathogens in their environment.

For many years, I've been interested in endotoxin. Walter C. Alvarez, a gastroenterologist, showed that pressure in the intestine was enough to trigger a migraine in some people. But the pressure works in an environment already destabilized by endotoxin. The combination of low blood sugar and endotoxin predisposes you to any kind of other stress. Since the mushroom develops essentially in a bath of endotoxins, they are an inspiration to think about how our immune system works.

**Danny Roddy:** And they're very anti-estrogenic, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. They have anti-aromatase ingredients. One thing I didn't talk about in the newsletter was their anti-nitric oxide activity, paralleling the anti-aromatase.

The change in thinking about the immune system—from the early 20th-century idea of antibodies fighting "not self" to the ideas of Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matzinger—focuses on protecting the self. The integrity of the self is based on keeping the cytoplasm in its well-energized state in which the water has a relatively hydrophobic quality.

There are at least three classes of things in mushrooms I think we should concentrate on:
1.  **Steroids:** Lanosterol in mushrooms (cholesterol in ourselves) and progesterone stabilize the cytoplasm so proteins stay in solution.
2.  **Anti-estrogens:** These defend against the low-level defense system. In a crisis, you turn on estrogen and nitric oxide to stimulate cell renewal. If you have mechanisms that prevent the formation of estrogen and nitric oxide, you remove forces that tend to disrupt the cytoplasm.
3.  **Trehalose:** This is a mushroom sugar that stabilizes against endotoxin.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there an amount of mushrooms you need to get those effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's probably around a cup a day. The study I saw in China showed that a very small amount, combined with green tea, lowered breast cancer rates by 87%.

## Recipes and Preparation

**Danny Roddy:** You suggested in the newsletter to cook them for three hours. Do you have any recipes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I'm going to eat a large amount, like a cup, I like to put cheddar cheese or something meltable on it and melt it in the microwave. It makes a really scrumptious dish.

**Danny Roddy:** Could mushrooms replace meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think they would completely replace meat. The typical dietician chart shows potatoes and mushrooms as having insignificant amounts of protein because they compare the dry state of grains to the wet state of mushrooms. If you multiply the mushroom protein by five or ten to account for the water, you get something comparable to bean protein. I would compare it to milk; they are down in the range of 3% protein, like milk.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you try to get a certain amount of calcium per day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over the years I've averaged 2,500 milligrams of calcium at least, and around 100 to 120 grams of protein. Milk, cheese, and eggs are my staples, along with all the good tropical fruits I can manage.

**Danny Roddy:** Are you working on anything else right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** More on the nitric oxide stuff. It's a huge topic. I've been following it since the 1980s. At that time, I was interested in carbon monoxide as an endogenous toxicant. It turns out that even carbon monoxide is protective sometimes against nitric oxide. I see nitric oxide as one of the few things worse than carbon monoxide.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, I cannot thank you enough for doing this.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Thank you.
