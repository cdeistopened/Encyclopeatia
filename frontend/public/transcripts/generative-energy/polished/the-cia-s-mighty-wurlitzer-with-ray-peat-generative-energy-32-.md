## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy of DannyRoddy.com, and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, and biologist, Raymond Peat. In this hour-long episode, we'll talk about the creation of the CIA and its primary role in shaping U.S. culture through painting, music, language, literature, economics, philosophy, religion, social activism, and politics.

I feel like I just crammed for a test. I read your newsletter, I read the article by Paul Green—I forget his name—and I read a few people distilling down that book because I couldn't get a hold of it. I read the David Talbot book and reviewed that. Then I found a list of CIA atrocities, which was mind-blowing.

When you talked about the Indonesian genocide, I had no idea that's what *The Act of Killing* and *The Look of Silence* were about. I knew the general idea, but I didn't put it together. Those movies made a huge impact on me a few years ago, so I was pretty shocked.

To start things off, it might be interesting to get your current read on the political situation. For me, that was the thing that got me interested in exploring the past—how did we end up here? In your newsletter, you said that the CIA was "treating the world like an orchard, fertilizing some trees, pruning others, and removing unwanted trees and weeds." That was really interesting to me. So, if you go back in the past, maybe you can figure out how we got here.

What are your general thoughts on free speech, this left-right thing, the media, and race tensions? It’s interesting coming from you because you've lived through Vietnam, civil rights, and so on.

## The Coup Against FDR and the Rise of the Deep State

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the place you decided to start is sort of arbitrary. My consciousness started early during the Roosevelt time.

**Danny Roddy:** I was going to get your general thoughts on the current situation and then jump right back into Pearl Harbor. Do you want to go with Pearl Harbor first or go from the place that you wanted to go?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One perspective I have that brings things up to the present is looking at the coup against FDR in 1933 and '34, as described to Congress by Smedley Butler. The coupists—the great corporations of the country that wanted to get rid of Roosevelt because he was committing treason to their class—went quiet for several years. They focused on Harry Truman in the late 1930s as their guy, whom they put in place finally in 1944.

As I see it, they opportunely killed Roosevelt just before he found out what Allen Dulles was doing with the Nazis. So they had Truman in place when they shifted over to the Nazi-Dulles side.

During that time, Fletcher Prouty was involved in a lot of the secret plans going on in Asia during the Second World War. He tells a little about that in his book, *The Secret Team*, which refers to the privately operated CIA as related to Nixon and the Kennedy assassination. Along this stretch of time, you have people like Ted Shackley and Ronald Reagan getting put in place with the assistance of George H.W. Bush and the October Surprise.

**Danny Roddy:** The October Surprise was where he went to Paris to make deals with the Iranians not to release the hostages until they got Jimmy Carter out of office?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. On the airplane to Paris with Bush were high officials that everyone knew: Senator John Heinz and John Tower, conservative right-wing Republicans. Several years later, on successive days—April 4 and April 5 of '91—they both died in airplane crashes. People who were in a position to know what George Sr. and his associates were doing all came to bad ends.

Nixon and Schlesinger got put out through Watergate, and Carter got put out by various manipulations, such as the October Surprise. All of these things interact. Periodically, someone starts to string the pieces together, and they very thoroughly get wiped out as far as anything taken seriously goes. Do you know about Daniel Sheehan and the Christic Institute?

**Danny Roddy:** No.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He did a lot of putting together and sued the government for murder and assassination. Even though he had the evidence, his organization was destroyed because the judge said it was frivolous. He had to pay all of the legal expenses, and that bankrupted his organization.

## Media Control and Operation Mockingbird

**Danny Roddy:** Is this along the same lines as the JFK stuff? I'm skipping far ahead, but Edward J. Epstein was one of the biggest critics. The idea was that the CIA set up their critics—set up opposition to the ideas—so that it would be controlled.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was Braden who called it his "Mighty Wurlitzer" that could play any tune he wanted. Their best loudspeakers were the *Washington Post* and *New York Times*. The *Washington Post* was one of the most effective in wiping out people like the Christic Institute.

**Danny Roddy:** And that's Operation Mockingbird?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was one of its names at the time. But basically, it's just what they do.

**Danny Roddy:** When I was reading David Talbot’s book, he said Henry Luce, the Time-Life guy, was so interconnected to everybody. These major news outlets just had hardcore agendas and were all being manipulated by Dulles.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're all the same people. The CIA guys were recruited from among those. It's the scum of the ruling class.

## 1947: The Creation of the CIA and Nazification

**Danny Roddy:** Stepping back a little bit, you mentioned that you thought the culture had changed in 1947. That coincided with the creation of the CIA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The 1944 Democrat Convention—I knew several people who were there, and they stayed furiously bitter for 50 years afterwards about what happened. Fake tickets were printed up for people who had never been in the election, and the real delegates were shut out. So it was a completely funny convention that chose Truman to be the next president.

**Danny Roddy:** Who do you think was behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That same group that started the coup in '33 and '34. Morgan and DuPont were the only names that I recall, but it was the top powers in the corporations. They got Truman in position.

Dulles had been a Nazi finance agent between the banks and the corporations of Germany—Rockefeller and Farben. He was a buddy with all of the top Nazis. He was in Switzerland dealing with the Nazis, arranging for them not to fight the Americans coming up the Italian peninsula so that they could go hold off the Russians to keep them from getting all the way through Germany.

Stalin, through his spies, found out what was going on in the first week or two of April 1945. Roosevelt said, "Maybe Stalin is losing it because this couldn't be happening. Stalin must be making it up that Dulles is letting the German-Italian branch of the army head to the Eastern Front." Before FDR found out that Stalin was right, he was dead.

If he had found out, that would have revealed that Dulles was leading a pro-Nazi army, dealing with the Gehlen Intelligence Organization and the top army people to unite the Americans with the Nazis against Russia to keep control of Western Europe.

So, the whole denazification thing in Germany was fraudulent. They just changed their party labels. As many of the technical people as possible were brought into the U.S., like Wernher von Braun for the rockets. Instead of denazifying Germany, the U.S. was Nazified.

**Danny Roddy:** You were actually there. Were there any people asking, "What is going on? How are these Nazis being brought over here?" Was the press just not doing its job?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost no one was concerned. They said they were denazified, so they're okay; they were really the "good underground Nazis." The Nazi reality never sank in.

Take Konrad Lorenz getting the Nobel Prize. He was the architect of genocide. Even in his post-Nobel book, he kept using all of the ideas that he had presented to Hitler as the reason for exterminating Black people, Gypsies, Jews, and Slavs. All of the people that got killed wholesale were justified by the specific things that Konrad Lorenz wrote, and he kept writing them. In his newer book, he used a German word slightly milder than "extirpated"—something like "weeded out."

**Danny Roddy:** It reminds me of Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize for dropping bombs for eight years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** [Laughter]

**Danny Roddy:** So, 1947, the creation of the CIA under Truman. President Truman signs the National Security Act of 1947, and that gives no rules to the CIA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By that time, he knew who Allen Dulles was, if he had any brain at all. That whole thing became fairly public, except it didn't get to Roosevelt in time to save his life.

**Danny Roddy:** Why was it necessary to kill Roosevelt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because Dulles and his people were committing horrible treason and setting up the Cold War—setting up Europe to make war against Russia.

**Danny Roddy:** If Stalin was aware of everything, was there no way for him to penetrate the propaganda?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, because the jukebox was being operated by Dulles and his people.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that the Congress for Cultural Freedom?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That, and radio stations and the great newspapers. 95% of the newspapers followed the *Washington Post* and *New York Times*. There were only three newspapers known for being independent out of thousands in the U.S.: the *St. Louis Post-Dispatch*, *Medford Mail Tribune*, and the *Valley News* in California.

**Danny Roddy:** Frances Stonor Saunders says, "Whether they liked it or not, whether they knew it or not, there were few writers, poets, artists, historians, scientists, or critics in post-war Europe whose names were not in some way linked to this covert enterprise." So even if you didn't know you were part of this cabal, you were actually part of it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If all the newspapers, radio stations, and foundations in the U.S. said it was criminal to think otherwise, you were just quiet because everyone around you seemed crazy.

**Danny Roddy:** Did you keep your thoughts to yourself at that time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I was in the seventh grade in a social studies class. The seventh-grade boys were supposed to spend their recess time cleaning the grounds. I put up posters showing a reclining gopher and organized the "Loafer Gophers" instead of the "Eager Beavers," and got scolded for that.

Then in social studies class, a kid who was kind of a goofy, nice kid asked Mrs. White, the teacher, "Are they going to kill Raymond Peat for being a communist, if that's the policy?" She said, "I don't think so. He's a nice little boy."

## Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Imperialism

**Danny Roddy:** Was Eisenhower following the same line of being put in the presidency like Truman, or was he the real deal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically, he was very stupid. But yeah, he was just following the ruling class, whatever they said.

**Danny Roddy:** And Allen Dulles was CIA director in 1953 under Eisenhower.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eisenhower came out by witness many years later that he had specifically given orders to kill Patrice Lumumba. At the time, I considered both Eisenhower and Kennedy—who had been elected by that time—as having been involved. Kennedy, as President-elect, should have been aware of what was happening.

I started out being very negative towards Kennedy. A few months later, Dag Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash. I figured Kennedy must have been responsible because it was right in his administration, under his direct authority, that the CIA was there in charge of things.

Hammarskjöld had been facilitating the imperialists in the Congo—the Belgian, British, and American agents. But after Patrice Lumumba was killed, Hammarskjöld suddenly started being even-handed. He was going to arrange peace discussions between the two sides. That was when he got killed. It was obviously an assassination.

**Danny Roddy:** I want to get to Dag Hammarskjöld and George de Mohrenschildt. But first, what are your thoughts on the antagonism between JFK and Dulles? I'm confused how somebody like that even got into office if they hated him so much.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Kennedy's point was to go after Eisenhower and Nixon for being weak on communism. He said he would lead a great military buildup, which he did. He was the militarist's candidate. He said that Eisenhower had let him in on the fact that they were going to invade Cuba. Part of his militarism was saying, "Eisenhower has let Castro get away with everything. We'll go after Castro." So he was the right-wing extremist in that election. That really annoyed Nixon because Nixon had told him what they were going to do, and Nixon couldn't say, "Wait, we're already planning that."

**Danny Roddy:** That conflicts with the idea from David Talbot and others that JFK was anti-war or a reasonable person.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He might really have been upset over the Hammarskjöld killing because of what Hammarskjöld had in mind for Indonesia, which was to make Sukarno a puppet of the U.S. rather than leaving it with the Netherlands. Kennedy had his way of controlling Indonesia without the formality of colonialism. But despite whatever relative good he saw for Indonesia, he was still thinking imperialism. Twice he talked to his ambassador to Brazil asking if it was basically time to do a coup yet against João Goulart. The ambassador said when the time was opportune, but there was nothing urgent right then.

## Indonesia, Gold, and Regime Change

**Danny Roddy:** Paul Green describes some plot where they discovered some mineral that they wanted, and Dulles was friends with George de Mohrenschildt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Neither Kennedy nor Hammarskjöld, nor just about anyone in the world, knew about the high-quality oil or the gold and copper—two huge deposits in Indonesia. The Dulles-de Mohrenschildt people had been secretive about that so none of the authorities knew. They wanted to get the Dutch out before they let it become public. The Rockefeller people bought up the properties, and I think they still own it through a Phoenix-based company.

**Danny Roddy:** So under the guise of anti-communism, the CIA overthrows the democratically elected Sukarno with a military coup. The CIA had been trying to eliminate Sukarno since 1957. According to Paul Green, Sukarno not siding with Dulles enraged him.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was all it was with João Goulart in Brazil. Kennedy said, "He's looking slightly neutral. We'll have to get rid of him right away or later."

**Danny Roddy:** When I read the list of atrocities through the CIA, it seemed bonkers. Do you see Dulles as the person driving all of these different things? It seems so complex to manage all these regime changes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to visualize the ruling class and how it works. It has these upper levels of academics and political lawyers for the big corporations working like secretaries of state and intelligence agency heads. There's a whole crop of these very well-informed people at the heart of both economic and political affairs. They are like a worldwide coarse mesh—only a few hundred people on that level sitting on top of thousands of corporations. Maybe 3 million or so ruling class people in America and Europe. They already have the power, so the state power is fairly trivial compared to how we think of it. They see the state officials as inconveniences, but not too hard to get rid of.

**Danny Roddy:** The creation of the CIA gave this oligarchy a tool to do whatever they wanted.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you see the Neo-Darwinian marriage with Malthusianism as a type of elite religion for them to justify their actions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The science world is very similar to the finance-politics world and has its intersections. A few of the top science people are closely connected to the political power. It's all the same recognition of power: where they're going and who they want to control for what purposes.

## Obama, Anthropology, and CIA Fronts

**Danny Roddy:** We talked about the Indonesian mass genocide in 1965-66. Do you want to talk about the connection between Obama, his mom Ann Dunham, and his stepdad Lolo Soetoro?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reporter Wayne Madsen, I think his picture is basically right. His grandmother was probably connected with the CIA as a paymaster for people in the Pacific. A friend of mine was a tool of the Nugan Hand Bank, which was the CIA funnel for drug and weapons money in Vietnam and Iran-Contra through the '60s and '70s. That opium and weapons money was handled through Australia and Hawaii.

I assume there's been some interaction between the bank that Grandma Obama—Madelyn Dunham—worked for. She was a vice president of the bank that was handling CIA money.

His mother was in that anthropology study. Pretty much the anthropology profession was serving the CIA, mapping out people to either exterminate or control. In Mexico and Latin America, it was the Summer Institute of Linguistics, which codified native languages to give them instructions. Anthropology and religious missionaries were tied into the CIA to gather information on populations. In Indonesia, the anthropology people were helping make surveys of who was to be exterminated by the new government to make sure they didn't go neutral or favor China.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned opium. How much of that is involved in the power elite funding things? I perused a book on Skull and Bones saying that whole thing is tied to the sale of opium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They use whatever has force. Religious missionaries are one way of doing it, drugs are another, and just force is another.

## Ramparts and Limited Hangouts

**Danny Roddy:** In 1966, the *Ramparts* affair happened, where the magazine began untangling the nefarious acts of the CIA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people say the CIA was subsidizing them and promoting them to do a partial "limited hangout." The facts are so much worse that they want to make it seem that everything has come out, to make people stop looking at the connections.

When you start putting things together—like conservative senators Heinz and Tower having that connection to George Bush—it becomes inconvenient. That ties into John Kerry and his investigation, and why he didn't pursue it. It shows interconnectedness in government. On the surface, it seems crazy to connect extreme right-wing senators to extreme left-wing organizations like the Christic Institute. But when you weave the strings together, you get a thousand parts that fit snugly. The official explanation starts sounding crazy.

**Danny Roddy:** What year was it when Bush and Kerry ran against each other, and they're both Skull & Bones members? What a coincidence.

## Brzezinski, Afghanistan, and Religious Extremism

**Danny Roddy:** I was interested in Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, and the Trilateral Commission.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Brzezinski was controlling Carter, basically. Rockefeller was controlling Brzezinski. Brzezinski cooked up the plan to get Saudi Arabia to start sending people into Afghanistan with U.S. weapons.

The Soviets had set up a secular government in Afghanistan with education for women and basically democratic practices. Every time a secular government is created in the Muslim world, it's as bad as being neutral. Brzezinski was one example of that; the overthrow of Mossadegh was their first big anti-secular case.

The most fanatic anti-secularism came when the Soviets had set up a non-religious government in Afghanistan. The Cuban Missile Crisis had the outcome of the U.S. agreeing to take their rockets out of Turkey, and the Soviets hoped to get another buffer state without rockets in Afghanistan. To prevent that, Brzezinski got the fanatics armed with the best weapons to fight the Afghan democracy and the Soviets who supported it. That went on until Carter was out of office, and eventually, the fanatics won under extreme support from the U.S.

**Danny Roddy:** There are articles showing what Afghanistan looked like in the 1970s, and it looks like modern people walking around. Today it's just rubble.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The religious extremism was all created by Brzezinski. They brought the same sort of people into Serbia and took over Kosovo.

**Danny Roddy:** It's interesting that Brzezinski was so tied to Obama. He was in Obama's inner circle.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same sort of thing as Hillary Clinton praising Henry Kissinger. It revealed who she really is. You've heard about her newest book in which she explains the real meaning of George Orwell's *1984*? She says it means we should trust our leaders, experts, and the press more.

**Danny Roddy:** That reminds me of Mayor Giuliani saying, "Real freedom is about obeying authority."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. The meaning of *1984*.

## Modern Politics and the Deep State

**Danny Roddy:** Having been through so much, do you see the current situation as incomprehensible, or is it a logical continuation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only pleasant thing about it is that so many other people are starting to see the loose ends. Before, if you had an economic theory of why wars were fought, you were ignorant, crazy, or subversive. But the atmosphere has changed; lots of people are questioning things now.

**Danny Roddy:** If you talked about the deep state before, you would be labeled crazy. Now it is being talked about openly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People always prefer surfaces, but now the surface is being slightly redefined. Before, the state said it wasn't true that the state was really rotten all the way down. Now they analyze it and say, "Here's the surface and there's a deep state." But it's always been just one rotten state. Now people are starting to break it down into its parts and seeing the illusion—how consent is manufactured.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you see the creation of the CIA as the real issue, not necessarily the government per se?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. People started separating the CIA from the government when Eisenhower had scheduled peace talks with Khrushchev. Everyone was expecting big things. Then, with Lee Harvey Oswald—a U-2 expert—in place in Russia, Dulles sent a U-2 plane over Russia. He knew they had the expert who knew exactly the recipe for shooting it down and overcoming their radar defenses.

Sending this U-2 plane over to be shot down just days before the peace talk sabotaged the talks. Eisenhower knew who Dulles was and still let it happen. Eisenhower was stupid, but he was also the one who kept Dulles in place. So you could say there were different factions working, but they weren't really separate. They were just slightly inconvenient to each other.

**Danny Roddy:** I watched a video by Lisa Pease, and she echoed what you just said—that Oswald was incredibly good at radar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was what he was trained for, as well as speaking Russian in Japan. The information that has come out provides a complete, fine-grained picture of what was going on in the assassination. All of the context fits: who was murdered, the official story, the function of the Warren Commission. There's not really any mystery anymore.

**Danny Roddy:** What is your general thought on Trump? Do you see him as part of this oligarchical cabal or a free agent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think he's a free agent with some good instincts, but also an instinct of self-preservation. His thing about not wanting nuclear war is his basic good impulse. But what can you do with just being president?

**Danny Roddy:** Some people said when he met with Kissinger, "Oh, this guy is no good."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think he's insincere about most of what he does. But over the years, he seemed to come up with some insights. About 20 years ago, he suggested having a one-time wealth tax. He said it would cost him $200 million or something, but it would pay off the national debt, and we'd be almost tax-free from then on.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** Truman said to his biographer Merle Miller in 1973 that the creation of the CIA was a mistake.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Recognizing any of its evil, how could he say otherwise?

**Danny Roddy:** He said the CIA makes their own wars. He also has a quote saying that they killed Dag Hammarskjöld.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A witness to the cabinet meeting where Eisenhower told them to do it didn't come out for 50 years, but everyone knew it at the time. I suppose Truman had much better information than the public.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have any thoughts on Lyman Lemnitzer, who wrote Operation Northwoods? Reading through that is sobering on how crazy things can get.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually, the most disgusting things they do in conversation; they don't do stupid things like keeping records. Even the act of keeping records, I'm sure they don't do it with the really vile stuff. In that situation, people are free to imagine, and their imagination can seldom catch up to what's really happening right now.

**Danny Roddy:** To end on a positive note: Are things so bad that you don't see them getting better, or do you see some hope?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you get a lot of people with some very simple insights—like abuse of power is going to be the rule, so there should never be power exercised in private or in secret—people will automatically start moving in the right direction. Just insist on complete openness. With the control systems through the media, schools, and legal system, everything is going to have to happen outside of all of those channels.

**Danny Roddy:** James Angleton, CIA counterintelligence head, said in his testimony to the Church Committee, "It is inconceivable that a secret intelligence arm of the government has to comply with all the overt orders of the government."

Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm working on an article on milk, putting milk in a cultural context. Looking at the false assumptions and thinking about how to start rethinking things from a new point.

**Danny Roddy:** Awesome. I cannot wait to read it. Ray, you've been so generous with your time. I sincerely appreciate it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Fun to talk to you. Thank you.

**Danny Roddy:** Bye, Ray.
