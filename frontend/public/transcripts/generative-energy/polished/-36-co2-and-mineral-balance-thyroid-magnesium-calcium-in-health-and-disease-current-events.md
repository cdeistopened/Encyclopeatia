## Introduction: Caffeine and Steroids

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, and we're live. Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat. Georgi, I won't interrupt. Go ahead and ask your question.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yes, I saw a study published in 2004. It was a bodybuilder in Portugal who went to the hospital for some reason. The doctors gave him some blood tests, and he admitted to taking steroids. But when he showed the doctors the vials that he'd been using, the amount of steroid in the vials was really small, yet he had huge muscles. They tested for other chemicals, and he denied taking anything else.

He said, "Yeah, I've been only taking that steroid, and every time I take the steroid, I'm also taking 200 milligrams of caffeine." So they said, "Hmm, maybe the caffeine is somehow promoting the effects of the steroid." Then they tested *in vitro* dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with caffeine, and caffeine increased the transcription effects through the androgen receptor by 300% to 400%. So they concluded that caffeine somehow increases the effects of the anabolic steroids, at least of androgens like dihydrotestosterone. I thought the same thing may be happening with thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, one of the good things that the favorable steroids do—progesterone, the androgens in particular—is to stabilize the cell in such a way that it can expel calcium and sodium, get rid of the short circuit of the energy process, suppress glycolysis, and move into the oxidizing state. Caffeine works probably analogously to the steroids and carbon dioxide, by a structural electron-attracting effect that they all have in common.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen some of the older studies from the '50s and '60s showing that they administered some kind of a vitamin D analog—I think it's called dihydrotachysterol—that was really good at calcifying soft tissue? And then they showed that androgens can actually decalcify the cell; like testosterone and progesterone can get the calcium outside of the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, caffeine does the same thing. I think that's the basis for caffeine's protective effect on the liver, against fatty liver, fibrosis of the liver, and carcinogenesis. All kinds of cancer-causing processes are blocked by caffeine, whether it's radiation, chemical carcinogens, or even viral processes. All of those are pro-inflammatory, pro-glycolytic, reductive processes. Caffeine is like progesterone, supporting the oxidizing structures.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think caffeine has some effect similar to sodium, like it's perceived by the cell as a mild irritant, so the cell ramps up its metabolism in response to being exposed to caffeine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that would account for the stimulating effect, but at the same time it has the calming in a bigger sense, stopping the dangerous types of excitation while letting the cell respond to adrenaline.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there's a certain amount of caffeine daily that's optimal? Because I saw some epidemiological studies saying that anything more than three cups of coffee a day didn't really increase the benefit regarding liver disease and osteoporosis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most of the best studies that I've seen found five cups a day. The benefit was still increasing in the population. They said five or more cups per day, for example, had the least liver disease, least dementia, and in some studies the least cancer. So I think it depends on your need. In some people, it might go up to maybe 50 cups a day. When I was hypothyroid, I felt best when I would have 30 to 50 cups, just constantly drinking fairly strong coffee with cream.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Wow, so you were drinking more coffee than milk at that time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, no, I drank a lot of milk too, but generally not together. And interestingly, I didn't produce a tremendous amount of urine because I evaporated so much. At that time I would steam up even a fairly big room full of windows in cool weather.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would be a good sign that the person is getting their metabolism too high and getting a bit dehydrated? Is there anything else that can be used to test besides urine color or viscosity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your urine starts getting very dark and thick, you should take more fluid. It doesn't hurt to pour excess water through. Sometimes in hot weather when I would drink gallons and gallons, I might make maybe two quarts of urine. Depending on the heat and activity, sometimes I could evaporate two or three gallons out of my lungs and skin.

**Georgi Dinkov:** But in cold weather, it's probably a little bit better to be on the high osmolarity side, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, probably.

## Carbon Dioxide, Calcium, and Energy

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, kind of the theme of the show goes along with what we were just talking about. Last time we talked about turning food into electrons, passing them through the cell, making carbon dioxide, ATP, and water. So I thought this week we could talk about carbon dioxide and the calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium regulation, because I know that's a central theme in a lot of your work. Maybe starting from wherever you see as the most pertinent: the regulation of those ions and what happens when too much calcium and sodium go inside the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can start almost anywhere and end up the same place. Things that support oxidation, like thyroid hormone, are acting largely through forming carbon dioxide. One of the major functions of carbon dioxide is, in proportion to its increase, it suppresses formation of lactic acid as the alternative low-energy form of metabolism.

The low energy goes with letting large amounts of calcium and sodium accumulate in cells, leading eventually to chronic structural changes. So keeping your CO2 up steadily, year after year, gradually prevents the structural changes so that keeping yourself in the CO2/thyroid responsive state doesn't get harder with aging. If you slip back periodically, going out of the carbon dioxide state tends to allow collagen to increase, and lipofuscin and other esters of cholesterol with polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) increase as harmful baggage that builds up with age.

**Danny Roddy:** I think in our last conversation you were saying whether calcium was sedative or excitatory depended on carbon dioxide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The CO2, one of its actions in the bloodstream is to form compounds—not exactly calcium bicarbonate, but complex ionic compounds—keeping calcium in an ionized state. When it's in this ionized, water-soluble state, it isn't in a state that has an affinity for cells.

If you hyperventilate for a minute or two, you'll notice that your fingers, hands, and feet tend to cramp up. Losing the calcium outside of cells in the water-soluble state, along with other changes happening with the loss of carbon dioxide, causes the calcium to go into cells instead of being held outside by the CO2. So the absence of CO2 in the cell makes the cell gain an affinity for calcium.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Isn't the mechanism for entering the cell by calcium binding with ADP? When ATP levels drop and ADP levels rise, calcium has an affinity for ADP and that's what is keeping it there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, ATP binds magnesium, so most of the magnesium in the cell is attached to the ATP molecule. With the lower energy state—less thyroid and less CO2—the ATP isn't reformed as fast, so you have more ADP which binds calcium. That's part of the cell increasing its affinity for calcium at the same time that calcium is losing its affinity for the blood solution.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So if you're not producing enough CO2, there's nothing to take calcium outside of the cell as well, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. CO2 effectively, by streaming as it's formed from the mitochondria into the extracellular fluid, tends to drag with it the mobile ions, calcium and sodium. When you lack carbon dioxide, the formation of lactic acid takes over. Lactic acid has the same destabilizing effect that calcium, lack of oxygen, or lack of thyroid does.

The lactic acid shifts the oxidative-reductive ratio of everything in the cell so that all of the components lose their electron affinity to a small degree. The cell loses its interactive affinity for carbon dioxide and progesterone. Lactic acid itself is to some extent a chelator of calcium. Probably the best explanation for calcification of the arteries and soft tissues is that lactic acid goes into the blood vessel or other cell at an abnormal concentration along with increased calcium, and together the chelated calcium and lactate combination with phosphate tends to form permanent crystallization inside the cell.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I saw two studies recently showing that blood vessel calcification can be directly triggered by cortisol and aldosterone. Do you think those effects are mostly due to the fact that they interfere with the cell's oxidative metabolism and increase the production of lactic acid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep. Blocking the energy. Aldosterone and cortisol both directly interfere with mitochondrial oxygen use.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you see the intracellular calcium as a signal to slow down the system or is it like a biological screw up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In one situation it's a challenge to adapt to, so it can be a growth and development signal that accounts for our particular shape. But that same process, when we are no longer evolving fast enough to invent something new to do with it, starts making tissues stay too long in the excited state. It gets harder and harder to rouse your oxidative resources to relax the tissues, squeeze the calcium out, and stop the lactate production.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If there isn't enough ATP to bind the magnesium, my guess is that magnesium will simply flow out of the cell, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, apparently that's what happens when your thyroid is low.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So if the doctor says, "Oh, let me test your blood magnesium," maybe magnesium in the blood shouldn't be high. That wouldn't necessarily be a good sign, right? Since it's an intracellular mineral.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly like potassium. High potassium often means that your cells are dying and letting their potassium leak into the bloodstream. Same with magnesium.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think there's any good blood test for intracellular magnesium? I saw a company advertising an erythrocyte magnesium test.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Erythrocytes are mainly glycolytic in their energy system, so they aren't very representative of the oxidative cells. But it's undoubtedly better than just the dissolved magnesium.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about hair and nail tests?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nails are probably pretty good, but hair is exposed to the air, water, dust, and fumes which bind strongly to the hair. Hair is a terrible way to get an impression of what's happening in your body. But nails, especially toenails where they're relatively shielded if you wear shoes, will be better.

## Cellular Excitation, Cancer, and Treatments

**Georgi Dinkov:** Ray, you mentioned intracellular calcium being excitatory, but in your "Fats, Functions, and Malfunctions" newsletter, you quoted an article that said DHA and arachidonic acid brought the cells to a new steady state of moderately elevated intracellular calcium, where the cells became virtually insensitive to external stimuli. Can you expand on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably the long-range thing is the cholesterol-PUFA ester that interferes with the proper stabilizing functions of cholesterol. In a way, it's keeping the cell in an activated condition that lets calcium remain too long. In that semi-activated condition, you don't have as far to move. If you're already half contracted, it takes a giant stimulus to get you to contract the rest of the way.

**Danny Roddy:** What's the differentiator between if a cell becomes overexcited and shifts into the proliferative stage versus becoming insensitive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably a lot of things acting on whether the mitochondria can activate the cell dissolution process of apoptosis, in which the cell activates the right proteolytic enzymes and dehydrates and harmlessly deconstructs. That takes a certain amount of energy. When the cell is beyond that state of responding to stress with a neat dissolution, you get either a nasty inflammatory lingering death that poisons its environment, or it becomes a deranged scar tissue or tumor cell.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I'm sure you've seen older studies showing that giving animals with cancer GABA drugs, like benzodiazepines, was highly therapeutic. How does GABA act on the calcium in the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The basic thing is that the GABA gets rid of the sodium and calcium excess.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Another interesting study showed that infusions of the magnesium salt of ATP quickly made tumors go away in animals. Do you think the energetic supply of ATP and magnesium was the signal that allowed the cell to get rid of its extra calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. The compound with magnesium probably is the right way to use ATP therapeutically because other forms will break down easily. Free ATP is very dangerous; it's one of the major danger signals or activators of inflammation. But when it's bound to magnesium, it is probably not toxic outside the cell and can get inside the cell easier.

## Calcium Supplementation and Parathyroid Hormone

**Georgi Dinkov:** As far as your recommendation to consume a significant amount of calcium daily, some people have emailed me asking if someone is in a state of calcium overload, wouldn't giving them extra calcium make things worse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The harmful calcium overload usually results from high parathyroid hormone (PTH), which usually goes with increased aldosterone and other problems. But the overload is intracellular under the influence of the anti-metabolic action of PTH. Vitamin D and calcium act first to knock down parathyroid hormone—the lower the better—and let the cells return to the self-maintaining state.

People who have had their parathyroid glands removed surgically for kidney disease often recover from lots of symptoms. Their sleep improves, seizures stop, and inflammation decreases. If your kidneys haven't deteriorated, taking vitamin D and getting lots of calcium will hold down your PTH and let the cells re-energize themselves and get rid of their calcium.

When I talk about vitamin D, I mean cholecalciferol, definitely not the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. That activates the so-called vitamin D receptor, which is activated by high PTH and does the dirty work of high PTH, such as turning on lactic acid production.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Most people with advanced cancer have hypercalcemia. That's probably due to the excessive lactic acid which all tumors produce and high parathyroid hormone, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep. I've been thinking for a long time that there should be regular testing of blood lactate. You can diagnose cancer even if you can't find a tumor. If you have a serious cancer developing, your blood lactate is going to be increasing, and the lactate becomes carcinogenic to other tissues.

**Danny Roddy:** Where would you want to see the lactic acid? What would be a healthy amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Now they usually say the normal range is 0.5 to 2.2 millimoles. But already at 2.0, the mortality is increasing. I would say maybe 1.0 would be a maximum compatible with health.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In your "Fats and Malfunctions" article, you said that intracellular calcium increases lipolysis. Is that a signal to the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, right inside the cell. Meerson had his famous calcium triad. He said besides contraction, calcium acts to increase proteolytic enzymes, lipolytic enzymes, and nucleic acid degrading enzymes. Those were the three main effects that made calcium deadly under the prolonged influence of stress and lactate.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is nitric oxide involved in how it's killing the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there are a lot of pathways that converge on nitric oxide too, like on calcium uptake. They all end up lowering oxidative production of energy and blocking CO2 formation.

## Reducing Lactic Acid

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've been looking at studies showing that methylene blue can directly reoxidize lactate back to pyruvate. Do you know of any other intervention that may help lower it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The right amount of caffeine helps, but all of the anti-inflammatory things are helpful. Vitamin K and ubiquinone are part of the defensive process.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I noticed a study using low-dose doxycycline for osteoporosis where lactic acid dropped dramatically. Being a quinone itself, was it acting like methylene blue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that is very reasonable because some of the flavonoids like fisetin, just by a slight shift in the electron affinity in the direction of more oxidized retraction of electrons, will have a big effect on stopping lactic acid formation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Would things like apigenin and naringenin also have a similar effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think those are the three most active.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There is a Wikipedia page about "phytoprogesterones," listing fisetin, apigenin, and naringenin because they activate the progesterone receptor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they're all doing a little bit of the same thing.

## Hormones and Evolution

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, I asked you a few years ago about prolactin and parathyroid hormone having parallel functions. Do you think one evolved before the other?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Evolution invents one way to do something, and then as it advances, it invents another way, but it doesn't give up the first invention. Usually, we have two or three ways of doing everything.

**Danny Roddy:** Occasionally I've seen lab work where prolactin is low (5 or 6) and PTH is high (40 or 50).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Different things like thyroid deficiency increasing TSH fairly directly increases prolactin without such a direct effect on PTH. But they vary closely with each other. High cortisol, PTH, and prolactin are doing similar things, but each one has its own other regulatory influences.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) being related to endotoxin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, just as one of our basic threatening environmental factors starting the threat to disorganize the cell.

**Georgi Dinkov:** PTHrP is known to be dramatically overproduced in cancer patients. Is that something cancer cells produce themselves to get more calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, apparently. What it really needs is something to ionize the calcium and get rid of it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In one of your articles, you mentioned that cancer cells have such hunger for polyunsaturated fats that they can get quickly overloaded with them and die. Maybe the same thing is happening with calcium—a desperate attempt to trigger apoptosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's a reasonable thought.

## Diet and Evolution

**Danny Roddy:** I've heard frequently that Ray's emphasis on calcium is misguided because evolutionarily we would have never got that much calcium in our diet. What is your perspective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eating leaves. Leaves are very rich in calcium relative to the protein. That's why milk gets its high concentration of calcium—mainly from the leafy diet. And if fruit is our evolutionary main driving force, the high sugar metabolism allows a low-stress metabolism that can use its calcium very efficiently. In experiments with a calcium-deficient diet, animals that got extra sucrose had stronger bones even without enough calcium.

**Danny Roddy:** So the idea that we evolved eating gigantic proportions of meat is pure fantasy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. I don't think that's possible because of the effect of high phosphate to calcium ratio. Eating a high fruit diet with sucrose—50% being fructose—lowers the reductive force of the cell and shifts it into the oxidizing state. The pattern of cell metabolism when we have enough sucrose is to not let calcium get into its toxic condition.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Even carnivores don't eat meat all the time. I don't think our ancestors were capable of eating meat every day. Also, fructose tends to deplete phosphate in the body because its metabolism consumes phosphorus, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it lowers the intracellular phosphate at least.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Somebody sent me a study saying, "Don't eat fructose. It's going to lower your energy levels because if fructose metabolism consumes phosphorus, you will not have enough to synthesize ATP."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's an optimal level of ATP, and you never get your phosphate so low that you can't use it to make as much ATP as you need. An excess of phosphate has a calcium-binding effect and cell damage, and it keeps the cell in the excited state. Keeping your phosphate under control is the good thing that parathyroid hormone does. The accumulation of phosphate with aging is what has made the Klotho gene so interesting; the anti-aging protein is mainly a calcium-phosphate regulator.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Have you seen studies that policosanols, the very long-chain saturated fatty acid alcohols, are also capable of activating Klotho?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't seen that, but that effect of a long saturated chain has a structural calming, stabilizing effect. So it's logical that it would be favoring Klotho.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A lot of Caribbean countries have a high number of centenarians. They call it the Caribbean paradox because they smoke cigars and drink rum. Do you think their high consumption of policosanols from sugar cane might have something to do with their longevity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there are several good studies in which there's a powerful correlation between saturation of the tissues and longevity. The more PUFA you have, the shorter your life is.

## Anthropology and Skull Shape

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of evolution, the Boskop skull and people with those larger heads—what do you think is going on there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of these things we've been talking about increase the foldedness of the cortex. High energy things tend to give us a thicker cortex. As it produces more functioning cells, it gets thicker and has to wrinkle. I think that's the thing that can, in a very short time, account for a very big skull like the Boskop.

**Danny Roddy:** You mentioned the last 130 years of history were fraudulent.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the history and biological books are written to confirm a paradigm which is radically wrong. Franz Boas, the founder of scientific anthropology, studied head shape. He showed that environment can have profound effects on the overall shape of the skull in just a single generation. People with parents from Europe had different head shapes if they lived in New York, due to climate and diet.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Vitamin K has strong anecdotal evidence that even small amounts drastically increase the ratio of head to body size and make the jaw wider in a matter of months to a year.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With aging, everyone's head gets wider. A handbook of aging data showed that with every decade up to age 90, there was a steady increase in the amount of DNA inside the skull.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Marian Diamond in the 1960s studied the effect of an enriched environment on rats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** She found that increased progesterone prenatally radically increased the brain size. Estrogen decreased the mass of the brain but increased the shape of the face, making the jaws bigger. The progesterone produced a bigger cranium in relation to the face—a sort of baby-faced rat, more intelligent-looking but younger-looking.

**Danny Roddy:** Have you noticed a difference in Hollywood stars from the '50s versus today?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think Trump's wives illustrate the stylish change in Hollywood and the advertising culture.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Some anthropologists studying Indians in the Andes noticed that even in very old Indians, there was no decline in DHEA and testosterone. Also, the older males looked more like children, and their heads were bigger.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone tends to increase and make up for the reduced oxygen concentration at altitude. Progesterone facilitates the delivery of oxygen and sugar to the tissues.

**Georgi Dinkov:** You talked about flamingos living past 150 with no difference in health span. Do you know what that could be due to?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think high salt and calcium. They tend to live in salty lakes, and their diet is exaggeratedly overloaded with both calcium and salt.

## Psychology and Society

**Danny Roddy:** I was reading Carl Rogers' *On Becoming a Person*. He said clients seem to move toward being a process, a fluidity, not disturbed by inconsistency. Do you map a hormonal situation to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. All of the things that reduce stress and rigidity. Lowering your serotonin tends to make you less authoritarian and rigid. Increasing cell energy makes you more flexible mentally. Margaret Mead showed that literacy freezes everything associated with literacy, which tends to be authoritarianism. Non-literate cultures were absolutely flexible and intelligently revised their whole culture when needed.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think self-actualization is a similar hormonal situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Right from the beginning, all of our understanding is empathetic. There is no awareness of the world which isn't also assimilating the empathetic view of others. That has to be educated out of people to fit into a society in which inequality is a virtue.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you know doctors undergo special training to teach them not to empathize with patients?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because the premise is that if you're treating sick people and they die, you'll get depressed.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think analytical thought is under the control of serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, serotonin creates basically fear, anxiety, and withdrawal. Education is designed to change our organism towards a "follow the leader" behavior.

## COVID-19 and Politics

**Danny Roddy:** Can I do a quick summary? You're saying the virus is real, but people testing positive is a facade because there's no accurate test?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're calling everything that tests positive a "case." But a case has always meant a case of sickness. It's dishonest to call it a case when it's only a test. If the virus is present, it doesn't mean you have reacted to it or had any sickness. This particular coronavirus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme, which destroys inflammatory angiotensin. If there is a huge amount of virus, it inactivates the enzyme, turning on your inflammatory system. But if you have enough progesterone and carbon dioxide, you turn off the inflammation at the base. 80% of people don't get sick when it's present because they have enough progesterone and CO2 and not too much PUFA.

**Georgi Dinkov:** A recent article in the British Medical Journal showed 20-50% of people have pre-existing immunity, and most had no antibodies. It's T-cell reactivity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That should stimulate a reconsideration of the whole 115 years of medical immunology theory. The "lock and key" antibody idea is bogus. The real immune system is everything in the organism that makes it able to stay healthy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** For some diseases like HIV or Hepatitis, having high antibodies is a bad sign.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Progesterone is considered an immune suppressant because it limits antibody production, whereas estrogen drives furious production of antibodies. Estrogen destroys our thymus; progesterone can regenerate it.

**Danny Roddy:** Let's speculate about the endgame. I've been watching Ice Age Farmer, documenting the destruction of food warehouses.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That fits perfectly with the digital money program. If that happens, you don't have to destroy the food supply to get it under monopoly control; you'll have everyone's purchasing power under central control.

**Danny Roddy:** James Corbett put out a video called "Coronavirus and Climate Change," suggesting they are seeding the narrative that climate change is worse than COVID.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're getting away with a nonsense virus pandemic. If people catch on, they'll have to come up with something new. They're blaming the fires on the Pacific Coast on climate change, but it's really driven by 100 years of clear-cutting forests, which were the climate moderators.

**Danny Roddy:** What's the point of these disasters?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The overall policy is to change the whole economy, get rid of self-sufficient economic activity, and turn everyone into a potential employee.

**Danny Roddy:** What about rural areas? Do you think they'll sweep through and stop self-sufficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the '30s, they sent the military or police to wipe out pigs, chickens, fruit, and vegetables to increase the price of food. Now they'll identify independent co-ops as terrorist dangers or claim the animals have COVID-19.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think local law enforcement might switch loyalty?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At some point, the empire necessarily has to fail. When it fails, we can expect intelligence to erupt in unexpected places, including rural police. But for now, they are heavily indoctrinated.

## Listener Questions

**Danny Roddy:** Desiccated liver tablets have become popular. You wrote that they contain oxidized tryptophan, cysteine, vitamin A, and ubiquinone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What you'll get will be a few stable B vitamins and lots of iron, plus toxic breakdown products. Vitamin A in the process of oxidizing can catalyze attacks on surrounding materials. Eggs would be the next best substitute rather than dehydrated liver.

**Danny Roddy:** Does gray hair always involve an excess of iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Iron probably goes into the damaged pigment-forming copper-containing enzymes. Even though excess iron wasn't necessarily the cause, it's likely to show up as a presence associated with the white hair.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Ray, are you familiar with quinine in tonic water? A recent study showed quinine was 10 times more effective than hydroxychloroquine in killing the coronavirus. Also, studies show it depletes tryptophan and blocks serotonin receptors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That convinces me to try some tonic water.

**Georgi Dinkov:** The British drank tonic water with 300-500mg of quinine per liter while colonizing India. The FDA limits it to about 85mg now.

**Danny Roddy:** Last thing: Your thoughts on Trump getting coronavirus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have no opinion. I'm not convinced that he even has anything. It would be politically opportune.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, thank you so much. Georgi, thank you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Thank you.
