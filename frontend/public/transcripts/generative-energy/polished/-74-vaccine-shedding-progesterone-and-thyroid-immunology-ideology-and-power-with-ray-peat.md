## Introduction: Bacon, Nitrates, and Allergens

**Danny Roddy:** One, and we're live. Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat. Ray, how are you? It's been two months, feels like forever. Catch us up on everything that's going on with you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm good. My voice is pretty much recovered from the laryngitis.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think it's just the stress of everything and the winter? I'm in a pretty cold house right now, and I've had to make a lot of adjustments just because of how cold it is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think what started it was eating some bacon that was cured with celery juice powder. It's a very allergenic material, and I think I gradually built up into a generalized allergic reaction that was like an intense cold as far as my voice was concerned.

**Danny Roddy:** You're the only person I know talking about how really terrible the food supply is and how so many allergens that people think might be benign can cause serious symptoms like you're describing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The market is full of good solutions to problems that never existed. Very intense salt, sodium chloride, is fine for curing pork or making bacon. You just have to soak some of the salt out of it to make it ready to eat. Many years ago, they found that a little bit of sodium or potassium nitrate or nitrite would give it a pink color and suppress bacteria growth, so that became the rule.

When someone discovered that it could be carcinogenic in very large amounts, they looked for alternatives. Some crops—if there's a heavy nitrogen fertilizer in commercial vegetable crops—become carcinogenic because of the extreme amount of nitrate and nitrite they contain. To create an alternative market, someone took the juice of these toxic industrial crops, dehydrated it into a powder, and found that the vegetable juice contained enough nitrate and nitrite to produce the pink color people wanted in ham and bacon.

So, that has become very popular now as supposedly a "safe" bacon, but it has exactly as much nitrate and nitrite as the bacon and ham made with the pure chemicals. However, it also contains the complex, extreme allergens that some of these plants have. Celery juice happens to be on the edge of toxic ordinarily, even if you aren't allergic to it. But if you're allergic to it, then it can become extremely harmful.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Well, the great news is we don't have to worry about the additives they're putting in the meat because nobody will be eating meat anymore soon.

## The Pandemic Narrative and Origins

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, everybody's dying to hear your current thoughts. What is going on right now? If somebody was clueless as to what was happening, how would you explain it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the winter and spring of 2020, I was saying essentially nothing is going on regarding a health condition. Nothing unusual was happening in the world. The only thing that was happening was a gigantic, highly organized scheme to convince and scare people that some deadly new pathogen was circulating.

Fairly early in 2020, I described my interpretation of the background. All through 2019, the germ warfare lab at Fort Detrick kept announcing that it was having spills and leaking designer viruses into the environment. Finally, the parent agency shut down what had been known for decades as the germ warfare laboratory. For them to have all of these little stories put into the press over a period of a few months, and then to take the step of closing the whole laboratory, I took that to be very significant. Ordinarily, they completely cover those up.

That summer, there were cases of novel pneumonia that were blamed on chemical cigarette substitutes, but they resembled in some ways the virus that later was known as COVID. Then, the annual military games between nations took place in Wuhan in the early fall of 2019. Ordinarily, the American military athletes are people training as Olympic competitors. That year, the Americans were ridiculously incompetent athletes—the historical worst showing of American military athletes since the games had been done.

Someone who had worked at Fort Detrick interpreted that the same way I did: following a string of highly publicized leaks from the U.S. germ warfare lab, then having the military circulate among the Chinese in the military competitions just before the supposed leak from Wuhan... to anyone who knows the history of American germ warfare, being so open and public about the connections seemed like a signal. Any sensible potential enemy would have to consider the possibility that the U.S. was actually preparing a release in China of their engineered viruses.

The Chinese, I imagine, would have interpreted that as an ambiguous announcement that there could be a germ release. It was so clumsily publicized that the enemy wouldn't want to take a chance that maybe it was a real release. They should take precautions. That would account for China being ready and highly organized in the way they responded, but their response was extreme—more than anything they had ever done.

On the surface, it looked like a test—an activation to see what China would do. If China was extreme in their lockdown, then China would be something to copy around the world.

## The "Great Reset" and Economic Shifts

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Within a few weeks of the Wuhan military games, there was a worldwide meeting in New York sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, Johns Hopkins University, and many other world powers—Event 201. In that meeting, they worked out a model of how governments should respond to the release of something like a COVID virus.

It was a detailed program to reorganize the world. The Rockefeller Foundation had the earliest explicit outline of the things that would have to be done, dating back to 2011. One of the articles was on "Lockstep." Basically, all three of their scenarios showed that the only prevention of the world catastrophe they imagined involved destroying the old economy to be replaced by an artificial intelligence economy.

This was expressed by Eric Schmidt, formerly of Google, who was working for an artificial intelligence anticipation committee of the Pentagon. Early in 2019, he gave a talk saying that the only way to save the world economy was to destroy all of the existing or legacy economies and to prepare for the monopoly giant corporations to take over.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So, the same thing as with the Vietnamese village—the captain who had to destroy it to save it from the Viet Cong?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. This was being delivered from all directions—universities, the Pentagon, all of the big foundations—and it was all coming out in the five to ten years before the actual event.

**Georgi Dinkov:** At this point, at least in the United States, it seems like the narrative is done. They try to push the mandates, but currently, they're on hold. Nobody's even wearing masks anymore on the street in DC. Where do you think this is going?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Luckily, we're not going there as fast as the ruling class had hoped. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, said at the very beginning of the pandemic that they were having a lot of success changing the world through the fear of global warming, but that was promising to take another five or ten years because it had to go through legislatures. He said this health crisis gives us the great opportunity to move directly into the reset using the authoritarian powers of government health boards.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What is that new artificial intelligence economy that Schmidt was babbling about? I work in that industry, and the whole premise of AI taking over and replacing workers is nowhere near what is being advertised. At best, it can do maybe 10% of what's been promised.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're still hoping that it will quickly come along according to their plans. But you can see within weeks, Amazon, for example, was making billions of dollars more than previously just because if you close down local businesses, people have to shop online. In Eric Schmidt's talk early in 2019, he said shopping online is a valid recreation—you'll love it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Well, Klaus Schwab's slogan was, "You will own nothing and you'll be happy."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, except them. They didn't say who was going to own everything if you aren't.

## Vaccines, Mandates, and Shedding

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of their giant plans worked to some degree because so many people are vaccinated now. Since the vaccine doesn't work at all as a vaccine and reduces antibodies for maybe six months, you have to get new injections. First, you need a third injection, but since that lasts only six months, you need a fourth and a fifth. Meanwhile, the taxpayers are paying many billions of dollars to the people selling these toxic injections. Since the law was passed in 1986, the providers of vaccines can't be held liable for anything that happens. It will become an annual or even more frequent affair to update your vaccine.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So we're moving towards a model of mandated consumption of services and products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the same idea they've been doing for years regarding transportation. You are legally required to insure yourself if you have a car. The Obama Act mandated that everyone had to buy health insurance or pay a fine.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the mandate for the vaccination fails through OSHA, do you think another option for the government would be to tell everyone who is not vaccinated that they will cancel their insurance plan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things like that. I think moving quickly towards more direct control of digital currency is one of their goals, so that there is no business going on without the authorization of the banks and the government.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what kind of emails are you getting from people being injured by the vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's now probably 10 to 1 more often than "What can we do to protect against a viral infection?" It's "What to do after you've been poisoned by the vaccine?"

**Danny Roddy:** And those symptoms are just the result of the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Sometimes directly following the vaccine, other times things such as bleeding episodes, sudden series of nosebleeds, dysmenorrhea in women, or babies starting to have vaginal bleeding. Apparently, these are being produced by the shedding of the vaccine material—putting the spike protein into unvaccinated people from vaccinated people.

**Georgi Dinkov:** How big of a concern do you think that is? Would that effectively make staying unvaccinated almost pointless?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The worst shedding fades out after the first few weeks, so hopefully that amplification shouldn't get out of control. But it's enough to make a person want to avoid crowds for a long time.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, since they're now planning for this to be a booster every six months, maybe every six months the unvaccinated should self-quarantine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think we should get together and insist on quarantining the vaccinated people for at least a month.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what if your significant other was vaccinated? Would you think the companionship and love would be worth inhaling the spike protein?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think I would keep my distance for a few weeks.

## Political Scenarios and "The Rich Man's Trick"

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you suspect they might have a placebo? This is a big experiment. Do you think not everybody is getting the same vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think for the insiders, you don't want to have famous people disappearing, dying, or having a stroke after getting vaccinated. I think they are very selective in avoiding giving anything but a pure water injection to the great majority of prominent public figures.

**Danny Roddy:** It feels like at the beginning of the year we were talking about pregnant women, and now it's 5 to 10-year-olds, and Fauci just said babies should get it. Does it take 30 to 50 years to figure out the side effects of any given drug or vaccine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, at least 50 years because it can be transgenerational. Cancers take 20 to 40 years generally to develop, but like the DES (diethylstilbestrol) babies of the 1950s, their children—three and four generations after the exposure—are still developing unique reproductive system cancers.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you have any theories on how they'll cover up kids getting myocarditis and dying after being vaccinated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By not investigating them at all. People like Fauci just say the vaccine is perfectly safe. They don't do autopsies or official investigations. The VAERS reports show a hundred-fold increase in deaths compared to the preceding 10 years, but they are not "happening" according to the government because no one is investigating.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think is next in store for the US? The COVID narrative doesn't seem to work anymore.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they're working on many alternatives. They're talking about things that could happen to the economy apart from a pandemic. A lot of ideas are waiting that could be sprung on us anytime.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think a possibility will be that they'll crash the economy and say, "Look, it was because of the virus, but now the damage is so severe, no amount of bailouts will help, so you'll just have to accept this new model"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. That's their business—making up scenarios through which they can take over absolute power.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Completely off topic, but have you ever seen "Everything is a Rich Man's Trick," the documentary?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government is run by the ruling class ultra-rich. Instead of doing anything to harm the ruling class, periodically the government is used to put on a show that they're going to knock down the ruling class. But that's exactly a scheme of the ruling class to preserve its position. The Antitrust Acts early in the century were a show. They didn't reduce the profits made by the monopolists.

**Danny Roddy:** I'm blanking on the family's name, but it was a Russian family. The revolutionaries took them in late at night and killed the whole family. That was a message to these ruling class families.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what the revolutionaries did—they rounded up the Tsar's family, the Romanovs, and killed them all.

## Immunology, Ideology, and Power

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, your last newsletter was called "Immunology, Ideology, and Power." Can you touch on the role the antibody theory of immunity has played in creating big pharma?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The German chemical industry supported Paul Ehrlich's experiments using dyes to kill pathogens. He showed that dyes had some of the specialized toxic properties of heavy metal poisons. He used the argument of specificity—the "magic bullet" doctrine—that a chemical medication should seek out and attach itself to the pathogen and not harm the host.

This became very dominant in the cancer industry, but it really created Big Pharma when the dye industry took over with derivatives of dyes. For them, the perfect definition of a magic bullet was antibodies. This was blended with the pharmaceutical ideal that every disease has its chemical treatment of absolute specificity.

Ehrlich shared the 1908 Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff. Ehrlich used the lecture to sell the idea of drug specificity. In Metchnikoff's talk, the only chemical treatment he mentioned that really helped was quinine. Quinine, as a natural substance, happened to have a broad spectrum of benefit, acting as a tonic to the host as well as inhibiting a variety of organisms.

Since there was no industry yet able to deal with the extreme complexity of the actual immune system that Metchnikoff described, the actual immune system was dropped out of science after 1908. By 1920 and 1930, vaccination and the development of antibodies became a staple of medicine. They were creating thousands of specific drugs, most of which turned out to be more toxic than beneficial, rather than something like quinine with an extremely broad spectrum of effectiveness.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There was a British writer who wrote that the British Empire conquered the tropical nations not because of its military acumen, but because of its incredibly healthy tonic water, which was made with a lot more quinine than the one nowadays.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the strongest of the tonic waters available have 70 or 80 milligrams per liter.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is the quinine an electron withdrawing agent helping to stabilize the flow of electrons?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's a basic part of it. It turns out that almost anything bitter tasting has an activating effect on our immune system. I think it's the organism's recognition of chemical generality in the world. When sickness is developing, tastes change and people start getting more interested in bitters.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In Eastern European folk medicine, bitter compounds are used for infectious disease and as anabolic agents.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a lot going on now with the biological meaning of the receptors for bitter tasting substances. Apparently, they tend to stimulate a detox system.

## Progesterone and Hormones

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, if somebody responds negatively to Progesterone—like they have breast pain—what comes to mind as a possibility?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very low thyroid functioning people are the ones who have that kind of reaction. If your thyroid is pretty low, even a teaspoonful of the vitamin E solution isn't enough to achieve a Progesterone effect. The first thing is to make sure your temperature and heart rate are in a good range because of having adequate calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid. Then you're sensitive to smaller amounts of Progesterone.

**Danny Roddy:** The Progesterone is kicking the estrogen out of the cells and it's deactivated, but it can be reactivated if it passes through an inflamed tissue, is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. All of those circulating things are picked up in proportion to the inflammation. One of the early detoxifying systems involves the liver's attachment of glucuronic acid to the substance to be excreted. It turns out that if you stress a tissue, it causes a tremendous increase in the enzyme that removes glucuronic acid from the substance. So your liver can be working very efficiently to detoxify it, but if something is locally irritated and inflamed, the blood passing through there will be subject to modification by the glucuronidase enzymes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Sulfatase as well. Basically, estrogen has been turned into estrone sulfate. Now they've been showing that estrone sulfate is the primary estrogen in menopausal women. It's like a long-term storage form of estrogen that circulates and gets converted into estradiol in any tissue that is stressed or inflamed.

## Listener Q&A

**Danny Roddy:** Who is the healthiest person Ray has ever known, and what does he think made them that way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known lots of healthy old people who were hardly aware that they had a stomach or digestive organs. They just ate what was available. A lot of it is the momentum that you inherit. There are fewer people like that now than there were 50 or 60 years ago.

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray have any thoughts on people's names influencing their behavior and personality? E.g., Raymond means "council protection" and Peat is a fuel.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over the years, I've noticed probably more than 100 famous researchers whose names obviously connected. Like Ray Birdwhistell, the nonverbal communication researcher, or Dr. Dripps, the anesthesia specialist, or Bacon Chow, the nutritionist. I think it puts it in their mind and arouses their interest eventually.

**Danny Roddy:** Is having a good sense of humor a sign that a person has a healthy metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With animals, you can see that simply the amount of well-being and energy drives the playing instinct. Cats, dogs, sheep... the sheep take a break from being normal and passive and just spend the afternoon dancing and frolicking.

**Danny Roddy:** Does Ray have any thoughts on handedness? I'm reading that left-handed people have a higher incidence of chronic disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the high energy metabolism is pretty much the whole thing. The Russian experimenters found that handedness became extreme when neurosis was developed along with energy metabolism failing. The healthiest—in the sense of a big brain—females in particular, who have bigger brains in proportion to their bodies than males, these excess brain conditions are where human-ness primarily exists.

**Danny Roddy:** What does Ray do to maintain a sense of novelty and wonder in his daily life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Looking for it. Looking for novelty is probably the best way to find it.

**Danny Roddy:** And you do that by reading or watching nature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Always possible. Our TV burned out many years ago right after the last of the so-called liberal programs was cancelled. We just haven't thought of TV since.

**Danny Roddy:** How do you get your news, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Occasional rumors and books. The situation with newspapers used to be that if you looked for the contrary of what the current government position was, that would be where the truth was.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In the movie *Inglourious Basterds*, the Nazi officer says, "I don't care about facts. They can be easily manufactured. But rumors can actually be quite revealing."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. You still have to interpret the meaning based on who is spreading the rumor.

## Intelligence, Neurosis, and Mexico

**Danny Roddy:** Ray once said incidents of neurotic fatigue, anxiety, and depression increased along with IQ. Is it only related to energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The culture dictates what it will accept as the level of general intelligence. Studies have found that the top IQ in big organizations tends to be in the 100-120 range. My favorite study was at Oregon State University using the Miller Analogies Test. The researcher looked at academic records and saw that the median score on the test correlated with peak academic success. But exactly as the scores deviated upward from the mean or downward, the academic success declined.

**Danny Roddy:** So the very smart and very dumb are unlikely to succeed in life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The original IQ guy at Stanford found that people in the 130s had very good academic careers, but those with 170 or 180 IQ were the ones constantly under pressure and sensing that they didn't belong.

**Danny Roddy:** As a person's health improves, do they become more sensitive to stressors such as toxic smells or bad food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One big difference is between men and women. Women are many times more sensitive than men regarding defense against toxins. Estrogen is the sensitizer there.

**Danny Roddy:** Last question. I get emails every day asking about Mexico. Is it safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was just reading about AMLO's (President López Obrador) challenge to his judicial system regarding vaccines for children. He definitely opposed it. It looks like he's getting away with saying that the vaccine is too dangerous for children. He personally is constantly judging how much he can get away with, and a lot of that depends on the foundations, giant corporations, and the U.S. government.

**Danny Roddy:** If AMLO was killed tomorrow, you said before that Mexico would retain its spirit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people who elected him are very progressive and conscious that the reason they haven't been able to go ahead is that the U.S. has intervened over and over. A big part of the population knows that they can't get away with fixing the economy quickly.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, what are you working on right now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The next newsletter is going to be around the idea of menopause relating to the failure of energy with aging.

**Georgi Dinkov:** One last question: Does Ray think there's any value to self-discipline and forming useful habits, or do you think a person's best life would be lived spontaneously?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely spontaneity. You've done your own energy in if you force yourself to work.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So do you think there's any circumstance in life where one needs to exercise their will?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes you have to do something until you can survive without doing it. You should only do unpleasant things if you're really forced to do them.

**Danny Roddy:** Amazing. Ray, thank you so much. Georgi Dinkov, thank you. Everybody have an amazing weekend.
