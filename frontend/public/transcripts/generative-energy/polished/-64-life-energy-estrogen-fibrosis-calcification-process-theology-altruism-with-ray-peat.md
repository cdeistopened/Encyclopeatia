## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Guys, welcome to the show. Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov. Georgi, I interrupted you. Go ahead, what were you going to say?

**Georgi Dinkov:** No, I was saying instead of a stick, just silently spray them with bee pheromones. They sell this odorless spray, and if you spray a few times on their clothes, they will have every domesticated and wild bee—and potentially hornets—chasing after them no matter where they go.

**Danny Roddy:** Just for some context, I was asking Ray what he would do if the pressure keeps tightening for vaccination. I asked Ray specifically what he would do if somebody knocked at his door and what it would take for him to leave.

But I feel like we haven't talked for a little while. Is there any specific topic you think is critical?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I've been thinking about the topic for the July newsletter. I try to finish my thinking by around the end of the month. It's going to be something related to iron, calcification of tissues, stress, and aging. These are themes that I got involved with more than 50 years ago, but I see little glimmers of change and interest in the culture. These are timely topics—age pigment and lipofuscin, for example.

**Danny Roddy:** That is something that's become more popular in the last year or two in general internet land. But you've been writing about inflammation, swelling, fibrosis, and calcification for decades. That seems to be incredibly misunderstood.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think it was 20 years ago that newsletter was concentrating on the connective tissue response to estrogen and stress. It talked a lot about the collagen surroundings of cells, which is one of the basic harms that stresses and estrogen activate. People were really doing definitive research in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, and then that pretty much disappeared because it impinged on industrial profit motives—the crude oil industry, the estrogen industry, and various branches of the drug and medical industries.

## Fibrosis, Calcification, and Aging

**Danny Roddy:** What's the typical medical view of fibrosis and how does your view differ?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The reason for the differences is that they're thinking in terms of the classical cell chemicals and enzymes enclosed in a barrier membrane, and the signals as being reductionist signals. 50 or 60 years ago, a researcher named Chvapil found that hypoxia and estrogen created the conditions to produce fibrosis by collagen synthesis.

Following his perceptions, I've tended to think in terms of global stresses and functions, whereas the standard medical thing is to think in terms of a concrete signal, like an irritant or a pathogen. What really shaped my dissertation in 1970 to 1972 was seeing that hypoxia, radiation, estrogen, and excessive PUFA all created the same biochemical reactions. On the cellular level, it was analogous to Hans Selye's general adaptation syndrome on the level of the organism. Here, it is the local adaptation syndrome on the level of cells and tissues.

**Georgi Dinkov:** On a more basic level, can we say that fibrosis is basically the connective tissue equivalent of the lipid pathway for getting rid of excess, unpaired electrons?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Except it doesn't get rid of them. It's a bad solution. It gets rid of them in the sense of killing off that part of the organism, walling it off, and detoxifying it, but cutting it off from function.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So it's like a dead storage for electrons, basically.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, separating the area of damage like a lizard throwing off its tail.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Would fatty acid synthesis precede fibrosis? Would it be a suboptimal way of getting rid of these excess electrons?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Oh, yeah. I guess that's a more physiological way. You just blow up with fat instead of calcifying and cutting off a part.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Right. So people gaining weight during middle age is a very common process. Then fibrosis, deterioration, losing muscle mass, and getting saggy tissue seems to be the process that happens later on if metabolic things are not recovered.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** It's doing on the systemic, whole-organism level what the local fibrosis does. It's preserving the organism at the expense of losing its functional tissue, such as muscle, and replacing it with fat. Exactly the same processes are involved. Intense calcification will cut off an area and turn it to stone. The process of aging is a very, very slow turning to stone. It involves calcification but in a diffuse way that increases inflammation as it lowers function.

**Georgi Dinkov:** And the calcium initially gets there with the intent to help because the cells need it as an anti-inflammatory. But if the cells are de-energized, then calcium starts to accumulate too much. Then, under the influence of parathyroid hormone (PTH), it starts to become part of the fibrotic tissue. Is that correct?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, the parathyroid hormone is working by amplifying the de-energized situation that starts it all. Something I noticed in the 60s—it turns up over and over in the old microscope literature—is that calcium deposits generally involve an association of iron. If you use stains for iron, you'll see it with all of these little calcium deposits.

## Tumors and Tissue Isolation

**Georgi Dinkov:** What's the signal in the organism that decides between killing off and separating a particular tissue, or turning into a tumor? Is there a threshold, or is it a chance event?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Adolf Fahr talked about that. He pointed out that there's always a progression from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification. Somewhere along that line, some cells manage to survive in a damaged condition. The tumor is a revolt of certain cells in the area that's being isolated and killed off. Those cells decide to survive. Since the organism didn't have the resources to prevent the loss of that calcifying area, they are also likely to lack what the escaping cells need. So although they escaped, they don't have the support from the organism to continue functioning as part of the organism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So if somebody were to look at a solid tumor localized to an organ, it should look like concentric circles with the tumor in the center, then a layer of calcification, a layer of fibrosis, a layer of inflammation, and a layer of glycolytic metabolism further out?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** One of the common things is that a tumor itself will be turned off by calcification. The body will wall it off and not let it go farther.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So calcification is basically a desperate attempt at walling off a metabolically deranged tissue.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, and it can do the same with invasive bacteria or parasites.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there a situation where this process is adaptive and should not be interfered with? If you're lowering parathyroid hormone, is there a situation where the body says, "No, I need that in order to wall that tumor off"?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think the better choice is to hope you can provide the energy and the vitamin D, and suppress the anti-metabolic parathyroid hormone.

## Hormonal Drivers of Degeneration

**Danny Roddy:** This newsletter implicates estrogen in the centrality of it all. You mentioned parathyroid hormone. What other hormones are coordinating this low energy shift?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Prolactin is one of the next involved. It involves serotonin, prolactin, and aldosterone. Eventually, growth hormone tends to be brought in as part of the failing tissue.

**Danny Roddy:** Like we talked about last time, the pituitary being roused in proportion to how bad the situation is.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, and serotonin generally activates too much pituitary activity. Then the pituitary hormones intensify the inflammation. For example, gonadotropins create inflammation and eventually cancer of the gonads. TSH, which activates the thyroid, eventually leads to inflammatory hardening, fibrosis, and cancer of the thyroid gland.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are the prostaglandins and leukotrienes also intimately involved?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Since I don't believe in such a thing as "essential fatty acids," I see the whole ideology built up around the prostaglandins and arachidonic acid derivatives as something that shouldn't be there at all. An Australian guy named Cleland found a series of prostaglandin-like substances that are made from the Mead acid—omega-9 fatty acids—which we make if we aren't poisoned by external linoleic acid. He found that they are, without exception, anti-inflammatory and constructive, whereas all of the arachidonic acid derivatives end up being harmful.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I'm sure you've seen the older studies showing essential fatty acid deficient rats heal their wounds without any scar. Wouldn't that implicate PUFA as the cause of the scar formation and fibrosis?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acid are amplifiers of the little bit of inflammation that should trigger replication and repair. If you had only the Mead acid derivatives, they would take care of limiting the inflammation response. As it is with our present environmental foods, the prostaglandins amplify the inflammation, derange the healing process, and make scar tissue, keloids, or cancers.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you are good at distilling hormones down to their basic functions. Estrogen is the "hormone of shock," aldosterone the "brittleizing hormone." What would you call serotonin and prolactin?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** In fish, prolactin is fluid regulating. When a salmon comes from the ocean and confronts the absence of salt in river water, they have a shock reaction—an estrogenic reaction—and put out a burst of prolactin. Like parathyroid hormone, this dissolves their bones and gives them an immediate "old person humpback." Estrogen increases our water retention and imitates the condition of a salmon hitting fresh water. The shock of that hypotonic condition turns on prolactin.

**Danny Roddy:** Is prolactin acting early on in the whole process from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah. Like parathyroid hormone, it turns off oxidative energy production and shifts over to lactic acid production. You get a substitution of protective carbon dioxide—which hardens the bone tissue and keeps soft tissue soft—with lactate, which softens the bone tissue and tends to calcify your arteries.

## Fibrin, Clotting, and Viral Infections

**Danny Roddy:** One thing we didn't touch on was the role of fibrin. That seems like it kicks things off and leaks out of the cell.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Fibrinogen is produced in the liver. Normally, there's a constant balance. A very thin layer of fibrin is normally deposited on the inside of capillaries, giving them extra strength, and on the outside of red blood cells. One of the main factors governing the balance between this constant formation and the breakdown of that layer is estrogen. A high estrogen person gradually gets thicker capillary linings and a thicker coating on the red blood cells, making oxygen take longer to get into the tissue.

Just recently, people are starting to see the D-dimer breakdown fraction of fibrin indicates how much stress there is. In the case of estrogen, it indicates how excessive your estrogen is. That is seen to be happening in stress diseases or viral diseases like COVID-19.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you see the recent study that came out saying vitamin E, specifically alpha-tocopherol, drastically inhibits viral repression for SARS-CoV-2?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Have you read the Shute family's works? They were working on blocking the anti-fertility effects of estrogen. One of the effects of estrogen was exaggerated clotting of the blood. They showed that vitamin E would accelerate the removal of established blood clots and protect the heart from forming new clots. It turns out that estrogen is a basic pro-inflammatory activator, and vitamin E is a very essential anti-estrogen and anti-inflammatory factor.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does every viral infection involve inflammation in one shape or form?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think so. Basically, we wouldn't be bothered by viruses getting churned out and eliminated. It's the inflammation that some of them produce.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So is it fair to say that the only reason we get these viral diseases is simply our suboptimal health state, not that the viruses are necessarily trying to kill us?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's the same with our exosomes—the particles that we make as part of our repair and communication processes. The viruses are almost identical to our own exosomes. When you're in a weakened state, you're also likely to be having poor reactions to your own exosomes. A sick cell can put out "sickness-communicating exosomes."

## Pandemic Politics and Economics

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to talk about David E. Martin. Watching his videos, his evidence-based approach with the patents is extremely interesting.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Some people worry about his credentials and his delivery—he seems to have studied oratory from Bob Hope and Jack Benny. He's extremely effective, but you just have to accept that he isn't a medical professor.

**Danny Roddy:** In one of his videos, he was talking about a quote from Peter Daszak: "We need to use the hype to our advantage to get to the real issues." The real issues being what Eric Schmidt is talking about—the destruction of the legacy systems.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, what Eric Schmidt outlined in detail in 2019 was happening to a considerable extent already in 2020, with many billions of dollars lost by common people and small businesses. All of that wealth was concentrated in Amazon and the drug companies. Exactly what Schmidt said had to be engineered for the US to get ahead of China by developing artificial intelligence to do the work rather than an ordinary human-based economy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a question about China. It seems like their system is not much different at its core. It's still using people as assets.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** They are just better capitalists than their opposition. They're using capital in a fairly arrogant way, but they're helping to eliminate poverty in China, which will increase the productivity of their population. The good thing about them is that they don't have hundreds of military bases around the world, so they can pour these resources into their people.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, there was a quote from you regarding the vaccines: "I think it could reduce world population by 80 or 90 percent." Some people were saying it might be fake. Is there anything to clarify with that?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** It *could* reduce the population. We just don't know how deadly it's going to be. It is verified that it is killing thousands, but the biology of it indicates that it could keep killing not just acutely, but by damaging the immune system. It's fairly likely to accelerate all of the inflammatory aging processes. For example, the vaccine is known to concentrate in the ovaries. If it transmits that ability to produce spike protein to the next generation, the longevity of that generation is drastically reduced.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Did you see the study about the women who took the vaccine in the first or second trimester having more than 88 percent spontaneous abortions?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I didn't see that, but the World Health Organization for years has been advocating giving flu vaccine to pregnant women. It's firmly established in animals and humans that inflammation during pregnancy causes damage to the fetus. What they've been doing in pregnancy is a large-scale crime.

## Progesterone Application

**Danny Roddy:** I wanted to talk about Progest-E. Since 2016, I've been much more partial to using topical substances. What do you think about using progesterone on your skin if somebody noticed digestive irritation?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Pure vitamin E is very viscous. The viscosity going down your throat can trigger a retching reaction. To lower the viscosity so it goes into your skin faster, you can add a little bit of olive oil on your skin first, then spread the viscous progesterone onto it. You don't want to mix it in the bottle because the extra olive oil tends to destabilize the solution. Mixing it right on your skin, you'll get a much faster absorption.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I have a report about a client using a drop in each nostril for her mom who has dementia and urinary incontinence. Apparently, that worked tremendously well. Do you have any qualms about nasal administration?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** With any oil in your nose, you have to be careful with the quantity. If it gets high enough that it can rain down into your lungs, oil in your lungs is something you absolutely want to avoid.

**Danny Roddy:** Can you critique my approach? I've been taking about 50 milligrams of progesterone, putting olive oil on my leg from knee to ankle, and rubbing it in.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** That's about what I use. If I have a sore elbow or something, I'll put maybe a quarter of a teaspoon on it with some olive oil and cover it from shoulder to hand. Get as much in as possible to get rid of the inflammation. After a bath, it really is good if you can soak your skin so that the top layer comes off. If you rub it thoroughly, you won't see any stickiness or shininess left. That means a good proportion of it is far enough into your skin that it's getting into the blood.

## Physics: The Ether and Space-Time

**Georgi Dinkov:** There was an article related to Einstein. Einstein replaced the ether with the space-time continuum. Now they came out with a proof that electromagnetism is a basic property of space-time. It seems the idea of this abstract, empty space devoid of properties is on its way out.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The Michelson-Morley experiment didn't show a null effect. It showed something like a 20% drag effect of the ether. Dayton Miller did the follow-up work for many years, showing that the earth does drag an ether with it.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I think there's one that NASA commissioned in the '80s by a physicist named Silvertooth. He confirmed the ether again, and NASA got really angry.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, and those follow-ups to the Michelson-Morley experiment carefully controlled for temperature, because that had been brought out as a defense of the space-time thing. They absolutely showed that temperature wasn't involved.

## Listener Questions: Mindset and Philosophy

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks: "What is a healthy way to look at the world, or what is an unhealthy way?"

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think it's important to get pleasure from looking at the world. Intrinsically, the process of being involved and learning gives pleasure. The attitude that the world is a place to be dutiful and do your work is a less healthy approach. Everything should be more or less spontaneous and fun.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the environment is crappy and oppressing us, isn't it abnormal to try to force ourselves into positive thinking?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Not force, but to find the route to get to the different state where you aren't being oppressed by the world.

**Danny Roddy:** Another question: "Ray has mentioned process theology before. Can you expand on how he arrived at that?"

**Dr. Ray Peat:** My experience of the world right from the beginning was that it was a process I was involved in. Everything was obviously an ongoing process rather than having fixed points of reference. Reading William Blake when I was 18, I saw his orientation was essentially similar. Then Alfred North Whitehead went into details in *Process and Reality*. It sees the universe as processes at every point.

**Danny Roddy:** A question from Phil Greaves: "What does Ray think of Marx's scientific method and social revolution?"

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Several Christians and capitalists have said Marx's science was very useful. Nelson Rockefeller said he understood Marx as well as the leftist reporters, but he used Marx's ideas to increase his power and wealth. That's the nature of a science; anyone can use it. But where Marx got his ethical orientation was right out of Christianity.

**Danny Roddy:** People are going to say all this COVID stuff and riots are driven by Marxist ideology.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I don't see any connection at all. You could say it's the Rockefeller world controlling class. They might understand Marx and use Marx, but Marx had the ethics that you should not kill off billions of people.

## Intuition vs. Intellect

**Danny Roddy:** "How much does intuitive thinking coincide with intellectual processing, and why does intuition at times lead us to poor choices?"

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Analysis and reasoning can lead to horrible outcomes. Intuition is different from simple reasoning because instead of starting with postulates and leading to logical conclusions, you're always open. When you change your postulates, you have a flexible, open view of the world. The organism is absolutely not a bunch of algorithms. It's a process that is constantly revising itself.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think one of the reasons for intuition leading to bad outcomes is because some people live in a world that's been deliberately engineered to disfavor such an approach?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Yeah, it's trying to implant its doctrines and ways of reasoning.

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks: "Is the desire for revenge always serotonergic, or can it have a place in a healthy person's psychology?"

**Dr. Ray Peat:** If you've been injured, you have to process the damage. Mentally, you can think of getting revenge as restoring your wholeness. It's a mental process of understanding why a person would injure you. You can have thoughts of revenge as part of the process of how to interpret that and go on without actually having to do destructive retaliatory things.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There was a study with prisoners of war in Vietnam. The ones who fantasized about getting back at their captors but without acting upon it did the best psychologically.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** That kind of mental imagery is part of a healing process, activating your creative ability in a bad situation.

## Consciousness and Routine

**Danny Roddy:** A listener asks about how the mind affects biological processes, along the lines of your book *Mind and Tissue*.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** The way we think about the body and its organs, we've been indoctrinated to think in terms of substance and energy as different things. But the body we experience is a unitary process. The organs, tissues, cells, and conscious experience are really all one substantial phenomenon.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If you're doing something repetitive, wouldn't that give a signal to the cells that they don't need to produce as much energy?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** You can't really do anything twice. Like Heraclitus said, you're always changing. If you're trapped in that kind of repetitive behavior, you either have to escape or go to sleep. People tend to put themselves to sleep rather than escaping from pointless work.

**Danny Roddy:** Last question: "What are Ray's thoughts on planes of existence beyond our physical world, such as the etheric and astral planes?"

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I don't think there is any "elsewhere." Part of those categories derive from thinking about matter as inert substance. If you have a metaphysical idea about what matter is, then you have to have an idea of what animates matter, so you get involved in separate energy and planes. But there are all different levels of subtle interactions.

Insects and probably dogs can detect at a distance a single vibrating molecule. The environment is constantly offering us information about itself. By tuning in, you can find out that our world is full of lots of information and messages that are ignored if you believe in inert matter.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why do you think the "second signal system" (language/abstraction) evolved? It seems to be a largely pathological development.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think it has practicality to make remote things something you can talk about, rather than having to stay with the surrounding immediate reality. But it is very easily pathological.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there a way to gauge a society by how much of each system is at play?

**Dr. Ray Peat:** I think the countries that have lost their grammar to some extent have opened up their ability to receive messages in a more realistic and biological way. If you have a language that is more fluid and flexible, that lets you have better perceptions.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, thank you so much. Stay on the line. Georgi, thank you for being my partner in crime. We'll talk to you guys soon.
