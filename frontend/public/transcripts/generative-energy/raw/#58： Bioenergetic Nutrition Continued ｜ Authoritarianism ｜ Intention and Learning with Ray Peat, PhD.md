Okay, normally I would say Georgie Dinkov and Ray Peat, but we only have Ray today.

Georgie, hopefully he'll come and we'll work him into what's going on, but it's just going

to be a chat between Ray and I. How are you, Ray?

Very good.

Okay, so immediately before we talked about your newsletter, I wanted to get into, I felt

like I kind of approached the nutrition topic a little bit off center on the last episode.

I thought it was good, but I thought my questions to you were kind of holding you up like an

authority and it wasn't conscious. I wasn't trying to do it, but I was unimpressed with

my questions to you. So maybe, I don't know, is there anything you can think of that would

kind of broaden the scope of what we were talking about last time in terms of approaching

nutrition? And of course that will probably lead right into your new newsletter.

Well, nutrition is as complex and open and undefined as metaphysics or cosmology or anything.

It's a process of exploring and learning and figuring things out. And so it's never a closed

book, never a finished subject.

What is the problem with authoritarianism in nutrition? Like if somebody says, "Oh, Ray

Peat says to eat 100 grams of protein and 200 grams of carbohydrate," like what does

that negate from the individual trying to figure things out?

Everything is always changing and always individual and always changed by context. And so what's

true for one person today, where they are will necessarily be somewhat different when

they're in a different place doing different things. It's always looking at your problems

immediately in your context and to understand those, it helps to look at your history, how

you got to where you are and what you want to do to get beyond the present. So all the

dimensions have to be flexible. And so your digestive system reflects the things you've

done in the past. Your whole being is taking form, assimilating things you've experienced

and intend to experience. So you have to think of yourself as an intended participant in

everything, including your choices of foods.

Well, given how complex everything is and everything's a moving target, like how do

you even approach the subject?

With what you've been doing and how it has worked for you. If you've been living on sweet

potatoes and pork fat and you're doing okay in the middle age, then you don't see much

need for a change.

But what if somebody was grown up eating cereal and fruit snacks? What would...

They probably wouldn't have grown up very much.

Oh no, that's me.

So would the context change if somebody's writing you an email and saying, "Hey Ray,

I have a low pulse rate, a low temperature, high cholesterol, constipation." Is that what

makes the suggestions in context with what the person is explaining?

Yeah. All those things point to hypometabolism, low thyroid function.

And then, okay, so if you're saying something like protein, carbohydrate, calcium, et cetera,

you're giving those facts to that person and then it's up to them, like we talked about

last time, the creative act of conversation and then that person assimilating the info

and trying to extract something out of it that means something to them in their life.

Yeah, because their digestive system is going to have its unique oddities and it might turn

out that the high protein diet that would quickly cure someone if they already have

a sensitivity to serotonin and tryptophan, for example, they might have to work into

that very carefully with a diet emphasizing more gelatin than the highest quality proteins.

And then when somebody says, emails you and says, "I'm doing the Ray Peat diet," what

is your... what do you think of that?

First, I ask them what they're eating.

So you automatically assume that that was... so just to be completely honest here, so I

told you that I don't like that term, and I used to edit it out of podcasts, but it

has gained a lot of traction. But you think even using that term, I'm not saying you think

this, but it's probably kind of to really reduce your work into silly territory, saying

something like Ray Peat diet, you think?

Pretty much. From what I hear, people are eating on the Ray Peat diet. At least, it

usually excludes eating a lot of bread and green salads and beans. But those are, I think,

a few of the things that people generally realize can be harmful.

Maybe you could critique my approach, but I feel like when I chat with a lot of people,

there's always diet stuff, but it almost seems like if they're talking to me, it's past the

point of no return with dietary intervention. Is that a bad orientation to have? Because

usually they'll have labs as well, and I think the person will generally be kind of at the

end of the road. They'll have tried veganism or low carb or carnivore or et cetera, et

cetera, et cetera.

And I'm almost inclined to suggest the vitamin D to read hypothyroidism, the unsuspected

illness to get into thyroid and stuff. And of course, doing the dietary interventions.

But I don't know, could you say after 20 or 25 that a person is like, I'm sure you could

say earlier, but that it's very hard to get the metabolic rate going just with food alone?

Oh yeah. Almost everyone benefits from adding a little bit of thyroid. The human diet historically

probably always included some supplemental animal thyroid, whether it came from chicken,

stew, or fish soup, or sausages, or even blood. There was always some supplement coming from

their food. And since 1940, that has been legally banned from the American food supply

and pretty much other industrialized countries imitating the US requiring slaughterhouses

to take out the thyroid glands. And people generally just don't eat the blood. It's sort

of a taboo. While countries that save the blood and make tacos out of it or something

are getting a little bit of extra hormones of various types.

Something I've noticed, and I don't know if you feel the same, but there's something

about thyroid that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with. They'll take progesterone

or DHEA or pregnenolone, or they'll even be taking other supplements like ashwagandha

or rhodiola or just you name it. But thyroid is a lot of crossing the line to a lot of

people.

I think the drug companies and the doctors that have been educated under their influence

are responsible for that. The same thing that caused the agriculture department to order

slaughterhouses to remove it from the food supply. Broda Barnes tells some of the stories,

for example, in the 1930s, he observed that thyroid deficiency, among other things, caused

an extremely high rate of heart attacks and circulatory disease, infectious diseases,

circulatory diseases and cancer were the main killers in a hypothyroid population.

But when he started popularizing that, there was a reaction and JAMA published a story

about a doctor who had given a patient who had just suffered a massive heart attack a

supplement of, I think, two grains of Armour thyroid starting right off on a full standard

dose rather than working into it over a period of weeks and the patient died. And so that

created the propaganda that natural thyroid could kill you with a heart attack. And that

sort of thing was amplified when the Synthroid, I think, was the first one on the market with

a synthetic thyroxine product. I was in junior high around that time and there were several

fat kids and most of the kids already at that time were seeing doctors regularly and almost

simultaneously two or three of my fat friends said that they didn't have a hormone problem,

they were just gluttons. That had been taught to the doctors who taught it to their overweight

patients. And that went with doctors ordering their patients to stop taking thyroid. If

an old empirical doctor had recognized that people with chronic infections or obesity

or any of the 30 or so classical symptoms of hypothyroid, if people had been doing well

taking Armour thyroid, they went to the modern update, the well-trained doctors told them

to stop taking it because it was dangerous.

As I say, in obesity, is the part of the look of obesity just that accumulation of mucopolysaccharides?

Yeah, usually it is. It's a mixture of Cushing's symptoms, high stress hormones of various

sorts and they can go in the direction of high estrogen or high serotonin or high histamine,

high cortisol, high aldosterone, imbalance of the androgens, many different hormonal

directions just because your thyroid is not giving you the energy to contextualize your

physiology to round everything off.

I'm searching for it right now. I'm sure I will not be able to find it, but I feel like

one of the most important things you've ever said that really helped me clarify my extremely

blurry picture of physiology is you said when your thyroid is low, your pituitary doesn't

have much to do and your ovaries don't have much to do either and all the glands in your

body have an easy job when your thyroid is high.

I appreciated that so much because if you listen to other people in the health world,

it's so ridiculously complicated to figure out, "Okay, where does LH and growth hormone

and prolactin and FSH?" It's incomprehensible without a model that you've put together of

the energy stress. When the energy is low, the activation of the stress systems happens.

I think it's helpful to have in mind a mental image of a libertarian world or an anarchist

society in which everyone knows what to do and how to take care of themselves. That's

when energy is abundant and your thyroid is good. When the well-distributed energy availability

isn't there, then you have to look to be pushed to do what you're supposed to be doing. That's

where the thyroid, the pituitary comes in. The pituitary is roused in proportion to how

everything is failing. It pushes you this way and that way to make up for what you should

be doing just on the basis of your cellular needs and cellular knowledge.

Little W.D. Denkla, you weren't kidding. I feel like you've integrated his work so well.

All the papers were perfectly in sync with what you were saying. I was really shocked

when I got a hold of a couple of them.

Yeah, it's funny how he just disappeared from the world of knowledge.

He's sent to the backwoods maybe? What was it, Dave McCarron, the calcium hypertension

dude?

Yeah.

Let's take a small break here. Ray Peat is on the line with me. Georgie, I'm not sure

where he is. I hope he's okay. Ray, your newsletter is available by email, Ray Peat's newsletter.

Yeah, this issue isn't quite ready. I sent you a draft of it, but I'm still working on

it.

Awesome. People can subscribe to your newsletter by sending $28 to raypeats, with an S, newsletter

at gmail.com. Is that right?

Right.

Then they can send that same email address. They can send any of the titles of your books

for that. We'll talk about Progesthe a little bit later, I think. You know what? We never

talked about those videos surfacing on the back of a tiger. Did you think anything about

those videos being released on YouTube?

I haven't listened to the whole thing that you sent me. I've heard enough recording.

I thought they were good. A lot of people really were excited to see you in action.

I think that brings a different element to it. If that movie has done something good,

it's released those videos. Those were fun to listen to.

Then before we pass by this whole subject, I hope I'm not embarrassing you or anything,

but I think people shouldn't eat things that damage them and should eat things that taste

good and that provide the essential nutrients while making them feel good and function well.

Is that a diet? Is there anything left to speak about that in such an authoritarian

nutrition world? Even your stupid apprentice is misinterpreting things as well. Any room

to clarify?

I'm okay with that as a statement that what tastes good is very important. Your impulses,

your needs very often are responsible for what you're eating. But if you're supplied

with something not quite like what you need, then your taste might cause you to do something

like overeating on sugar or salt. Your cravings are biologically logical, but if the way you

are led to satisfy your cravings is abnormal, then your body might be tricked into malfunctioning

even though it's following its impulses. When your thyroid function is low, your blood

sugar becomes unstable, and so you tend to crave sweets and alternatively salt, which

helps you to use the glucose efficiently. But if you're mixed foods that would supply

those needs, if they're very distorted, then you might not correct the problem by following

your instincts. So you have to use your other perceptions and thought processes to figure

out just what it is your body is telling you to do.

What was that H.G. Wells quote? It's like, "Nature never appeals to intellect unless

intuition fails." Or what was it? Something else fails? Your instincts? Instincts fail.

Just before we get comments, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm just joking, everybody.

Okay. But one thing is, could somebody be in such a bad place that their orienting reflex

and intuition is just so jaded and blurry that, for lack of a better word, or suggesting

something to them is... Would that still be kind of a bad situation? How would you approach

something like that?

People tend to be immersed in the forces of their authoritarian surroundings. The culture

that they have integrated is telling them to do certain things, like go to the doctor

if you feel sick. If your body doesn't play a role in those cultural instructions, then

you'll go to the doctor, go to your job, maybe go to church, do whatever the culture prescribes,

and ignore what your body is telling you. But anyone can start to listen to themselves.

When they are mentally hearing instructions, a conscience telling them what they should

be doing, if they listen carefully, they'll be able to detect the source of where that

instruction is coming from. The guru, I don't know what he was officially called, but George

Gurdjieff, his basic principle was "Remember yourself." That really meant looking at what

your body impulses are doing and put that into conjunction with what your environment

is ordering you to do. Like you call up an image of who is speaking the instructions

to you, and then check how that image and set of instructions goes with your heart plexus

and your solar plexus, and check out what it does to your body. Usually you feel a shrinking,

compressed feeling in your body when you hear those conscience voices speaking to you.

I feel the opposite when I eat a churmoya. You said G.I. Gurdjieff, right? Is that the

guru?

Yeah.

He has a quote, "Without self-knowledge, without understanding the working and functions

of his machine, man cannot be free and he cannot govern himself, and he will always

remain a slave."

Yeah, that's pretty solid.

Okay, great stuff. I'm a little bit, is trepidatious the right word, to get into your

newsletter because it's such a dense newsletter. I'd love to be able to summarize it, but

I wouldn't do it justice. I guess, what was your motivation for writing it specifically?

It was sort of a shotgun approach to explaining a general approach. Like a mosaic, you put

down a lot of the material that is going to make up the image, and you hope that when

you get enough of the material together, you'll recognize what adds up, the general meaning.

So it's just a collection of these last 120 years, or 200 years actually, of observations

about how organisms work and how they might work. And then looking at the very clear experiments,

showing definitely that they don't work in certain ways and do work in other ways that

have been ignored, such as the purpose and intentionality of single-celled organisms

all the way down to bacteria, making decisions and planning and changing their behavior according

to what they perceive the environment to require. If bacteria can do it, why can't a human brain

cell do something at least partly as competent as that? I think the culture has created partly

to instill a helpless attitude in the public, has created this doctrine that our brain cells

are among the stupidest of all parts of creation. They can only signal by on and off information,

yes or no, nothing, approaching the infinite judgment ability that bacteria or planaria

or amoebas display.

Something that reminded me of something is like, everybody has their desired outcome

for society or how we should organize ourselves, but the gist I get from you is that that hasn't

even been an optimal way of doing that, hasn't even been approached, or maybe it has slightly

with Marxism or something, but like an environment that actually supported our physiology or

biology or whatever hasn't even been broached yet.

Yeah, that's someone like Kropotkin put together biology and culture and politics into a single

picture.

And there's something you mentioned in this article that I haven't thought about for a

long time is the primary, how do you say that, psyllium? And that's like a little, you call

it sensing organelle or something on the cell?

Yeah, like our retinal cells have this little finger tip, it's like a psyllium except it

doesn't wiggle. It internally resonates with what's impinging upon it, and that resonance

is made available to the connecting nervous system. Same with the ear or the olfactory

nerves or the touch movement detectors all through the body. Each brain cell even has

its own little antenna tuning it into the environmental conditions.

Okay, so we're going to pause really quickly. Ray, I'm actually going to hang up on you.

I'm going to call Georgie, then I'm going to call you back, and I'm going to pause the

screen everybody. And so you guys will be hearing music and we'll get Georgie on the

line. Is that okay, Ray?

Okay.

Okay, so I'll call you back in one or like two minutes or so. Okay.

Okay.

Okay. Bye, Ray. Okay, hang on everybody. Okay, Georgie, we're live. Ray, we're live. Okay.

So there's Georgie. Everybody, this was probably my mistake. And so apologies to Georgie, I

think I told you the wrong time. Okay. So Georgie, we were going through, first we kind

of talked about nutrition. We got all that out of my system, which I need to talk about.

And then we're now we're going through Ray's newsletter. We just talked about the cilium,

the sensing organelle of the cell. And Ray, what are some of the other critical things

in this newsletter that you feel like are very important?

That's the theme that comes back over and over is the conscious purpose of each of the

component cells. Like the hologram idea is that conscious memories are not localized

in any part of the tissue, but people like Carl Preblum was the outstanding figure in

that line of thinking that the cortex through a network of synapses is able to make a hologram

that records awareness images in a non-localized hologram manner. And that is still limited

by the discrete nature of synaptic individual action, even though the pattern imposed on

that network of synaptic conditions or states, even though that's holographic, the underlying

substance of the brain function that Preblum advocated was still the old-fashioned behaviorist

mechanical on/off nerve cell is nothing but a switch-like conveyor of yes or no information

rather than something transmitting the complex image-like perceptions of each of the cells,

receptor cells or the nerve cells themselves containing a primary cilium in addition to

messages they're getting from other nerve cells. So it's trying to show that everything

that denies the complete participation of every cell in our conscious purposeful activity,

everything that denies that is based on an arbitrary assumption, which ultimately is

a false assumption that leads to behaviorism and mechanism and reductionism.

I have a question about holograms. Can a group of organisms, regardless of species, can sort

of band together and form a super hologram that combines their consciousness into sort

of like the collective consciousness that we all talk about?

Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their

primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick

up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

Do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people having visions and contacts

with people that have been dead for a long time? Basically, they're like re-materializing

that portion of that collective consciousness.

Yeah, I think it's important not to rule out anything, not to assume limits to awareness

that aren't based on some kind of real evidence.

So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are

simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from

it.

Yeah, and Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the

earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain-to-brain, by

way of the earth's resonant chamber.

Ray, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time, but in the Cosmic Clocks

book, if he's right and the seasons are imbuing people with an essence or something,

isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things, the absolute meaning of a certain frequency

of vibratory energy, each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique

identity. So the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction

of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates

everything around us, including the state of the sun and the planets and the earth and

other people in that system.

So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that

right?

Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means,

but that's a lot.

You think that may explain part of astrology and the planets?

Yeah, that's what the Cosmic Clock, Gokulen, Michel Gokulen.

Where does that idea go off the rails, though? I'm so stupid. What's the thing that people

read? They're horoscopes. Is there some point at which it becomes total nonsense?

Yeah, but that's just a literary genre. It can be interesting, but it's just a person

creating a cultural artifact that to some extent recognizes that we are in the cosmos

together.

Well, here's a question. If you were going to spend your life with somebody, would the

month that they were born in matter to you?

I don't know. I think the clash of frequencies might make it more interesting than too much

harmony of frequencies.

There's an optimal antagonism, so to speak, contrarianism that a lifetime partner should

provide, otherwise it becomes boring if they're too harmonized.

That is sort of my impression, that you want to be able to go off independently and come

back and keep renewing others with your odd and idiosyncratic learnings.

The Chinese have a proverb that love is not so much gazing harmoniously into each other's

eyes, but it's about two people looking together in a similar direction.

I thought I had said that.

Okay, then it's a resonance, I guess, across time. Somebody may have plagiarized it off

of your website and then presented it as a Taoist saying from the 6th century or something.

Okay, well, how about we talk about Progesty and then we'll get into some questions because

we have some really excellent questions, I think.

I have one more question related to collective consciousness and Rupert Sheldrake. I don't

know if you saw, he did a famous experiment with another person who was a contrarianist

that it's impossible to have a collective learning experience and extracting collective

knowledge from the ether. And then they did this experiments, I think, with chicks, they

were training them. And then each successive generation of little chicks was able to learn

faster and faster a new task. So is there anything special that's required in order

to be able to tune in into that collective consciousness and knowledge, like a fast metabolism?

Are things that interfere with that process? In other words, making you more and more isolated

from the collective consciousness?

Yeah, I think everything metabolic and neurological affects it. Do you know who Andrea Puharich

was? Henry or Andrea was his first name, but Puharich wrote a couple of books exploring

what it is that opens the consciousness to remote viewing, for example. And he got the

Pentagon involved and interested in it. But he was seeing it in terms of a balance between

the parasympathetic and sympathetic system in a context that I think Michael Persinger

comes the closest to explaining how these nervous system balances could be operating.

He saw when people were asleep or extremely relaxed, he imagined that their nervous system

is able to sort of extend its feelers out without regard to distance, for example, tuning

into the Earth's resonance. But during anxiety, there's a contraction and everything tends

to fall towards the anxious center. And so if a person is in the sleep or relaxed parasympathetic

state, their feelers are out. And if someone related to them is in a crisis, anxiety state

of androdermic dominance, their relaxed feelers will be drawn to tune in and focus on that

center of crisis or anxiety or despair. And I think that might be where Michael Persinger

took up his basic orientation of Andrea Puharich was writing in the 50s and 60s.

I thought the Pentagon was also using LSD to drug some of the remote viewers and see

if that enhances the performance.

What do you think...

Mushrooms too.

Mushrooms too.

How did you materialize from that research? How do you think it was applied? Do you know

anything about that?

There are several videos of some of the people who were involved working for the Pentagon-related

research centers, like the Stanford Research Institute. They have their personal experience

statements in videos that I think are worth watching.

Maybe they transitioned to Project Blue Beam for a fake alien invasion?

Say that again?

I said, maybe they transitioned to Project Blue Beam for a fake alien invasion?

Oh, oh.

I'm just joking.

Have you seen the news lately? They're always coming out of the Pentagon saying more and

more UFO sightings, something big is about to happen and everybody's glued to their TV,

which I guess is the goal, right? As long as they're not rioting.

I think it has served as a distraction for a long time.

Okay, well, let's get into these questions because they're... Oh, let's talk about progesterone

first. Ray, do you have any stories that you can grasp in your large bag of amazing stories

about progeste that we can talk about?

Oh, about any subject you want to apply it to. Dementia, epilepsy, sunburn, traumatic

injury, chronic conditions of all sorts, arthritis, asthma, pimples, acne, all kinds of stress.

Conditions on all the cellular levels, everything from personality problems all the way down

to whether a cell is inflamed.

This isn't directly related to progesterone, but a quote of yours that I sent to a lot

of people is, I forgot what newsletter it was, but you say something like, "Using progesterone

alone is not a good approach." You have to figure out what the problem is and usually

that's related to low thyroid function. So if a problem isn't miraculously solved by

progesterone, thyroid was probably the next thing to investigate.

Yeah. If you think you're dying of a migraine or a seizure, progesterone itself, a good

dose of that can very quickly bring you out of the problem, but then you have to figure

out what it was that put you into that unstable condition that needed progesterone.

And then last thing on this, some people are saying like, "If your nutrition is so good,

why do you need to add hormones?" And maybe a good response to that would be, "Our environment

is so terribly awful that maybe just even taking thyroid isn't enough kind of defense

from kind of the onslaught of metabolic problems we're faced with day to day."

Yeah. Even thyroid and milkshakes and quesadillas aren't always enough to make up for the horrors

that are imposed on us and some of the natural defects of the environment. Like we probably

should live more like naked mole rats sleeping in burrows in family clusters where we would

be producing a proper amount of carbon dioxide so that we would be soaked in carbon dioxide

for a good part of our lives, making up for the natural imbalance created by geological

changes.

I read a book recently about how people, the difference in sleep between these days and

back in the Middle Ages, and apparently people back then were sleeping in barnyards with

animals, 15 to 20 people all huddled together. And I guess the rate of degenerative disease,

maybe that's one reason why it was much lower. They were living like naked mole rats.

Yeah, having a cow and a pig in the house when you're asleep.

Makes life more fun.

You completely stole that out of my brain. I was going to make a joke about Ray, a long

time ago you said like an optimal society would include our animal friends and I was

going to make a joke about that and then you said it, Georgie, that's really wild.

That's how they used to live apparently. I mean, it was a book on anthropology. I don't

remember the author names right now, but he said that our current mode of life is drastically

different and judging from the archaeological findings and the examinations they did on

bones and whatever records, other records they could unearth, that he's saying that

apparently their lifestyle was conducive to much better health. They didn't have these

diseases back then.

Yeah, and I think carbon dioxide is always a basic factor of stress relief or stress

production depending on the concentration.

I have a question. Difference between thyroid and progesterone. Is there anything thyroid

does uniquely that progesterone either completely does not do or is much weaker or less capable

of achieving?

Yeah, the mitochondrial, you can uncouple the mitochondria by increasing your thyroid

temporarily to shift the ratio towards carbon dioxide from lactate and progesterone tends

to stabilize the mitochondria in an efficient, well-coupled condition. So like to get rid

of moles or skin cancers or such, a temporary, officially overdose of thyroid hormone. I've

seen fairly large uterine fibroids, for example, when someone was willing to stay slightly

hyperthyroid, keeping a resting pulse around 110 for three months, a large fibroid would

shrink permitting a pregnancy to proceed. And the same with getting rid of other types

of tumors and things that require corrective adjustments of the tissues.

So I thought that progesterone is thermogenic. Wouldn't that imply that it also uncouples

to a degree?

I think it achieves it by reducing loss as much as by maintaining, preventing the bypass

of the mitochondria. Keeps the mitochondria going efficiently, but at the same time, it's

reducing nitric oxide in the skin and preventing unwanted heat loss.

Okay, great stuff. Okay, so this is our first question. And the person quotes Heraclitus

and the quote is "Polymethy does not teach intelligence of things." And then their question

is "Much learning does not teach understanding. You can't really know something unless you

experience it. Are Ray's thoughts analogous to this?"

Yeah, you have to at least imagine experiencing it. The typical way of indoctrination and

school learning is by way of formulas rather than at least an imagined experience. And

literature and art should teach you, get your nervous system in the habit of thinking experientially

rather than in terms of algorithms and rote formulas.

Do you think the sterilization of learning, in other words, everybody's been turning

to not just a bookworm, but a very, what should I call it, rigid bookworm, may account for

the fragmentation of society? Basically, everybody's learned, but nobody really knows much about

the real world these days.

Yeah, true kind of learning always takes into account our world in common. And so that is

always an essential aspect of any little thing that you might know, how to play a music instrument

or how to make a fancy horse saddle or how to build a building. It always has to take

into account the overall world that we have in common.

So basically by preventing people from having common experiences, they essentially guarantee

that we can understand each other no matter how much we read about each other.

Yeah.

Great stuff. Okay, this one says, "Does Ray believe that some principles are worth dying

for?"

No.

I knew you were going to say that. Why?

Who wrote the principle? Whose principle is it? You have to look at the metaphysics behind

the principle. Make sure it isn't based on false assumptions and false metaphysics.

Would, so dying as an alternative to getting a vaccine is not rational?

Is there a connection?

Well, so say a hypothetical thing where it was like death or getting a vaccine. Despite

the horrors of getting a vaccine, killing yourself or something would not be a reasonable

option.

No.

Yeah.

It's better to be wounded and deformed by the vaccine than to be dead.

I was going to say war is, what is it? The expression is war is old man talking and young

man dying. So if somebody else wrote the principle, I'm with Ray on this one that you want to

be very careful whose principles you're trying to die for.

Right. So often there's an evil ulterior motive behind the principle.

Just to play devil's advocate, what about the phrase like, "Some things are worse than

death"? Like what if life was so much suffering after getting maimed by a vaccine?

I think your organism takes care of that. The stress hormones rise to the point that

it simply finishes off all of the processes.

I want to go on to this next question. What's like the, you know how W.D. Denkla was trying

to search for the death hormone. Do you feel like you figured out anything that he did

not figure out?

Oh yeah. There's no death hormone. It's just the death struggle of the organism against

these bad environmental problems.

And perceiving that there's no progress, right? Because if it's a great struggle but the organism

senses that there's progress, then this can actually, this shouldn't necessarily lead

to death.

No, no. Those processes are really last ditch survival attempts. The zooming up of your

growth hormone and prolactin and corticotropin, all of those are well-meaning survival attempts.

But they just accelerate all of the poor adaptations we're making to an inadequate environment.

Is death like, so those pituitary hormones are increasing, but maybe they cause prolonged

hypoxia and that leads to death? Is that right?

Well all of our adaptations are to a detective environment to one degree or another. If you

have to change your physiology to fit into the environment, the bigger those changes

are, the more your pituitary hormones are involved and the more it's diverting you from

what you would really like to be doing. And so the growth hormone has potential benefit,

but when you're forced to keep secreting it along with ACTH and serotonin and so on, the

outcome wasn't intended. But what it means is that you have adapted yourself, for example,

secreting more and harder insoluble collagen, turning yourself sort of into a tanned piece

of leather.

Saddle.

It makes you tough in a sense that can stand up to the environment a little longer, but

it isn't a good adaptive course to take. If we can improve the environment, have very

good nutrition, very good carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, a good amount of temperature and

sunlight and so on, then we can start mobilizing our intentional adaptive processes and in

that environment, the effort to adapt and become something else, you will tend to dissolve

the hardened collagen, remove the calcium from the soft tissues, put it back in your

bones and reconstruct a living vital organism. So the adaptive intention in a bad environment

leads you into degeneration. In a good environment, it leads you to restoration.

I was going to say, like three or four years ago, there was a doctor and he linked something

on Twitter and it was an article on fasting increasing growth hormone. And he tweeted,

"This is what Ray Peat does not understand." And he was inferring like the fasting was

increasing the growth hormone and you want to increase your growth hormone. And I just

had a little chuckle. Okay, next question.

The recent study on reversing the aging of the human immune system, they specifically

administered DHEA to block the aging, the pro-aging hormones of growth hormone. And

I strongly suspected the benefits that they saw from these treatments were actually due

to the DHEA, but it still pays off that they actually were aware that growth hormone has

strongly pro-aging effects. So you may want to send him this article or reply to his tweet

because it's pretty recent. It's from last year and it was in humans.

Great stuff. I will do. Okay, so let's get to this next one. What is it about Aristotle

that makes him a good scientist and what of his methods did the medieval scholastics fail

to adopt?

The idea of becoming, I think he took seriously Heraclitus' basic view of the world as everything

being in process. So I see Aristotle as a Heraclitian process philosopher, totally breaking

away from the platonic essentialism of an abstract finished universe. So he didn't have

a good data collection system, maybe the best in the world at the time, but it wasn't adequate

to create 20th century physics quite.

I remember an old interview, maybe it was John Berkhausen and he was like, "Ray, why

do you think William Blake was so smart and you said he didn't go to school?" Is there

a similar thing for Aristotle? Is there any way you can figure out how he knew so much

or his good orientation?

No.

Okay, fair enough. Okay, Georgie, interrupt me at any time. But okay, this is the next

one from Steve. He says, "How does the intangible of stress become a tangible phenomenon in

the cell? Where does it start?"

Reduction of energy, I think, is the general thing. Not getting enough energy to do what

it needs to adapt. And so it sends out signals that want more energy and that turns on emergency

organismic level processes like making more ACTH and cortisol to bring up the blood sugar

and get past the temporary crisis. But the cell ultimately needs to improve its use of

oxygen and glucose to properly restore the energy it needs.

Just a note, thanks for that, Ray. Just a note, all the super chats or super stickers

or whatever they're called will be donated to Ray. So just to let you guys know. Thank

you, Ray. Okay, this next one, we are going through these. Okay, it says, "How does Dr.

Peat organize his reading and research? Given he reads across various topics but is able

to put disparate yet related things together, does he have some sort of note-taking system

basically?"

Okay, you get the point. How do you organize your research, Ray?

I don't. My notes over the years are the most disorganized thing you can imagine. Occasionally,

they're helpful to remind me where I was, but definitely not like having a card file

of things that I've read, but just going from one thing that interests me to another.

Okay, just a minute. So this is shocking to me. So when somebody emails you about something

and then you reply to them and then you attach like eight abstracts, you're going to PubMed

and finding those abstracts or what?

Yeah, some of them I've put into my computer over the years for different reasons, but

usually I find things on PubMed that will answer a person's questions. Even though I

consider PubMed to be largely a propaganda source, it's a leaky propaganda source.

I want to second that, Ray's method over the years have struggled with many different methods

and eventually realized that the only thing that really worked was effectively acting

like a child, just following whatever interests you at the current moment in time. And at

least for me, synchronicity seems to play a big role. Things that I'm reading currently,

somehow miraculously in a few minutes later, I find other things that pop up that they're

disparate but similar, to use the quote from the person. Have you noticed the same thing,

Ray? That if you're reading on a certain topic, basically a similar concept will pop up in

another article, in another source of information, without you actually searching for it?

Yep. That contributes to my basic view of how the brain and the universe work. That

there's sort of a magic synchronicity, probably just because it seems like synchronicity or

magic just because we aren't clearly aware of the mechanisms that make it happen.

Have you noticed that children's play is structured very similarly? They basically base everything

quite naturally based on interest, right? They're not being told what to do when they're

little, and their attention shifts pretty quickly, but they always seem to be heavily

engaged into what they're doing, almost as if in a state of meditation.

Yeah. And with kids, their choices of foods tend to work the same way. They'll eat a lot

of something once and then maybe not touch it again for a month, but they're responding

to something in their physiology. And I think that is true in their play. There's something

in their physiology that wants to be developed as a true play.

So have you had similar experiences as an adult with food, which is related to the next

question that I think Danny is going to read? In other words, sometimes you eat a lot of

something and then the next week you encounter the same thing and you're like, "Eh, I

don't really feel like eating at all."

Yeah. I think it works the same in adults sometimes, but more often in children.

Georgie, can you push your microphone back a little bit? It's for some reason clipping

a little bit. Like, no, not close to you, farther away.

Oh, okay. Like this?

Yeah. Or if you move the actual unit a little bit back. Yeah. Okay, good. Thanks for that.

Okay. So speaking of that question, so this person made sure to clarify and they said

they weren't asking this so they could copy you. They were just curious. And so this person

says, "Can Ray go over what his past week of eating has looked like? Meal examples,

new preferences and tastes, or new experiments with food/meal ideas?"

They tend to cycle. Today, so far, I've had an omelet, milk, orange juice, and coffee,

and then some leftover mushroom soup and carrot salad and orange juice and coffee for the

afternoon. Yesterday, I had an appetite for a cheese taco, a toasted taco with melted

cheese on it. And it just is what I feel I have an appetite for that particular day.

I think our last chat with you increased tortilla sales by like 1,000% all over the world.

Ray, you're responsible for the inflation of food we're seeing all over the US.

I noticed that many years ago when I discovered that the Safeway store was selling chicken

necks at something like a dollar a pound. And I found two or three thyroid glands in

every package, a couple of pounds of necks. I mentioned that in my nutrition classes and

never saw a package of necks again. They constantly were buying them up and then Safeway stopped

selling them, I guess, when the word got out that they contained thyroid glands.

You've got to be careful about those liver sources and other things that you need to

feel well. Yeah, for sure. Okay, next question here. And then I was interested in, after

these questions, asking you some things just about, of course, the culture stuff that we

always go over, but I thought this would be a nice break from just getting questions from

Georgie and I. Okay, where ... Now I've lost my place in these questions. Thanks everybody

for watching. Give this episode a like. Again, all super chats or super stickers or whatever

are donated to Ray. And sincere appreciation for Ray and Georgie being here and taking

their time to do this for everybody. Okay, building off of the idea that when thyroid

is functioning properly, you can think any way you want to about anything. Can you explain

more about the physiological aspects of how our energetic state influences our thoughts

and perception? Is there an energetic component to thoughts that matches biological energy,

or is it more so that a higher energetic state ... And I think I clipped this question, but

you get the idea. Yeah, I think the high energy state is a

relaxed state of readiness. The infant brain with a very high metabolic rate easily goes

into complete relaxed sleep and replenishes its energy so it's ready for another episode

of very intense activity. That kind of episodic energy burst, I think, tend to give you an

image-oriented kind of chunky approach to reality and the problems you're thinking of

rather than just doggedly assembling bits and constructing a knowledge system out of

learned bits. It gives you an animal quality to your episodes of learning and thinking.

And like ruminating on the past, so that's that junky quality you're talking about, like

thinking about things that have literally no importance and can't move you forward?

Well, sometimes it's necessary to think about where you've been to better understand why

you want to go in a certain direction. So ruminating can be constructive.

One last thing. So I think you specifically talking about that quote, somebody emailed

you about trauma a long time ago, and you basically said if the toxicants and the energy

substances and things are right, you can kind of think how you want to about past events.

And so that just includes kind of intermittently thinking about things that have happened in

the past. That doesn't mean you reject what's happened to you. You're just not stuck on

them. Is that right?

Yeah. My view of memory is that it's a developmental state. Even though it passes in a flash, still

it changes our development all through the organism. Every little so-called memory, memorable

experience that we have is changing the structure of our organism. And it's simply scanning

the state of our organism when you're ruminating or considering the meaning of the past. It's

all present in the state of your organism. When you're remembering, you're really being

present to yourself.

Interesting. Okay. This one is, "May you ask Ray what he thinks about some people being

more subservient to authority than others? Why do some have this innate rebellious attitude

while others follow the narrative, no questions asked?"

It has a lot to do with your metabolic energy, how much DHEA and progesterone and pregnenolone

are circulating through your system. So you feel resilient enough to reject every little

thing that seems unhealthy.

Great stuff. I didn't know if this was true, but this next one says, "Thoughts on Chernobyl

steadily reactivating." Is that right?

Say it again.

It says, "Thoughts on Chernobyl steadily reactivating." Is that a thing?

I'm not sure what it means. The area around Chernobyl continues to be extremely contaminated

and deadly.

There were a few articles, I think it was last week, at least the ones that I saw, that

said that the detectors that are there in the sealed reactor that is under a concrete

sarcophagus, they're detecting levels of radiation that are increasing and can only be produced

if the chain reaction is somehow intensifying.

That's definitely possible. Molten fuel, for example, is moving around.

Yeah, they were thinking of essentially sending a robot in there and basically sealing the

actual reactor, the smaller portion of it, with graphite, is what they said, to sort

of stop the chain. They will try to stop the chain reaction, but they're also kind of hedging

their bets and saying, "It may actually trigger a nuclear blast, so we're not promising any

results."

We'll do a few more of these and then we'll let you go at, well, it's my time, your 6.30

time for sure, Ray, so we won't keep you too long.

Okay, "How to stop, slow down body hair and beard hair growth. Could topical progesterone

work or something else?"

There were studies published in France in the 1960s of topical progesterone showed women

with definite sideburns and whiskers and masculine chest hair who, through topical progesterone,

two or three months later, showed them with a feminine, hairless face and chest.

And same thing for a man, right? That would be the estrogen maybe activating the adrenals

and causing the skin to kind of be androgenized, is that right?

Yes, when you're deficient in those protective hormones, especially pregnenolone and progesterone,

then you're likely to overdrive the stress hormones and come out with too much androgens,

especially in women, and too much estrogen in men.

And just an update, on the Coke here, now all of the bottles say "Reducido Azúcar,"

and then I talked to the dude that works at the Tienda and he said all of the Coke now

is like that in Mexico. And so that is a thing now, like they've just changed the formula

of Coke and all of it tastes different now. And the dude confirmed that, just to give

an update for anybody who cares. So that is very sad day.

What kind of sugar is this?

I wish I had written it down, but it was like a mixture of new types of sugar. This is totally

new to you, right?

Yeah, I hadn't heard it at all.

I told the guy it was "Muy Malo," and he laughed. Okay, so let's get to these last, I skipped

over a few, but let's get to, okay, this was a popular one. Is there a way to remineralize

teeth and heal cavities?

Basically no. If the enamel is just slightly eroded and the protein framework is still

there, yeah, it can be very nicely remineralized. But once the decay has gone through the thin

layer of dentine and has broken down the dentine, gone through the thin layer of enamel and

entered the dentine, then the tooth from the inside can close off the progress. If you

have a very stable hormonal vitamin D calcium balance, the tooth from the inside is constantly

renewing the cytoplasm in the dentine channels and will close off, create resistance to the

advancing cavity. But I've never heard of being able to fill a cavity from the inside.

It can simply stop the progress.

Have you seen that study that got published in 2018? I think it was basically they showed

that applying aspirin topically to the tooth, despite being acidic, actually led to tooth

regeneration. I forget how much was regenerated, but it reversed that process and some actual

regeneration happened.

Was it in the dentine or just the enamel surface?

That I don't know. I mean, it may have been just a very, very shallow cavity and that's

why it regenerated. But I remember it was aspirin, it was topical solution. And they

were surprised too. They thought that because it's acidic, it should actually erode the

tooth even more. But in fact, it actually led to some regeneration.

I think the acid theory of tooth decay has tremendous weakness. The idea that bacteria

just make an acid. I think it's much more complicated than that involving antibodies

and subtler handling of the minerals.

You may have seen it. There was a study earlier than that back in 2015, which said that unbeknownst

to most people, competitive athletes have extremely poor dental health. And that study

tied that poor dental health to low thyroid function because of the constant exertion

they were having.

I didn't see that one, but thyroid is the main regulator of the health of your saliva

and the quality of your saliva really is in charge of what happens to your teeth on the

outside and it tends to correspond to the vitality of the pulp chamber, which maintains

the dentine from the inside. But definitely the thyroid is the main hormone governing

the quality of saliva.

Great stuff. So I was thinking for the last 25 minutes, we would just tune into the Great

Reset and is there anything new that, of course there is, but is there anything to focus on

that's happening that's mildly interesting or reveals something that they're doing?

The established lies are coming apart and resistance is starting to show some effects.

Do you mean the Wuhan lab stuff?

Yeah. Ron Unz, he has a good article showing the value of two articles, different theories,

whether it was a lab accident or not, but then he gives a third interpretation that

everyone seems to be carefully avoiding, which is the long established germ warfare policies

of the United States. Unz goes through the facts that align so much more perfectly with

this third option than with just the lab accident or not theories.

There's another article on the site, a recent one on his site, which says that basically

it was a failed bioweapon attack on China launched by the United States and when the

Chinese didn't take the bait, then basically the US said, well, we have an opportunity

to use it on somebody else. Who would that be? Well, our population and the rest of the

world and we're going to use this to tighten control for whatever other reason we have.

Iran really was the second target, just the elite politicians in Iran had a very terrible

attack right after China. I think one misapprehension of the germ warfare people, they really seem

to have believed that the ACE2 enzyme, they thought it was the receptor that let the virus

attack and enter cells. I think they really believed that. And the fact that the Chinese

have about 30% higher expression of the ACE2 enzyme, especially in women, women have a

higher expression than in men and in both sexes, the expression of ACE2 decreases with

aging. But I think the fact that the Chinese have such a thick expression of this ACE2

anti-angiotensin enzyme, I think that led people to believe that the Chinese would suffer

much more intensely from this virus than Americans or other racial groups. But in fact, the ACE2

is what defends us against inflammatory attacks such as virus. And so the populations that

express the most ACE2 rather than being the most susceptible to catching the virus, they're

the ones with the most powerful means for resisting the inflammatory consequences. So

women, young women are the most resistant, but it happens that the Chinese heredity gives

them an especially high resistance.

I'm not saying it wasn't produced in a lab, but isn't the idea that it's a bioweapon kind

of conflict with the idea that it's not harmful at all? I mean, the activation of the renin

angiotensin system, but that all of this stuff is just way overboard and just about control.

Yeah. Rona Unz talks about that, that it wasn't intended to kill many people and didn't really

kill lots of people, but it was a nuisance just like an effective cold virus. But the

theory was that it would give Chinese 30% more colds than it would give Americans.

Oh, interesting. And for this whole thing to work, would they really had to have created

something? I don't buy into it, but the alt narrative that there's nothing, you know what

I mean? And actually a lot of major, I think Patrick Timpani, he keeps listing people saying

that there is no virus, but isn't the whole thing now that, what's that word they say

for making viruses? It's in the news all the time now. You know what I'm talking about?

The Fauci keeps saying it, like they'll enhance a virus or whatever.

Oh, gain of function.

Yeah, gain of function. But anyways, you're saying they had to have created something,

right?

Yeah. Luc Montagnier has clearly expressed that he, in his lab work, understands how

you create a gain of function. You find some species difference, like the human expression

of the ACE2 enzyme was chosen as a target. And so they just adjusted the enzyme to be

able to stick more firmly, adjusted the virus so that it would stick more firmly to that

enzyme. And the people are arguing against the whole existence of viruses are in a way

onto something because the mechanism by which we maintain our genetic and physiological

interactions among the various parts of our body, the circulatory systems are carrying

exosomes in which our cells put out genetic messages that are sent to other cells. But

this apparatus is the same one that the viruses use to replicate the viral message. And in

size and structure, our exosomes are in most ways indistinguishable from the things that

are classified as viruses. And so if you give a vaccine or catch a virus and get the nucleic

acids into some of your cells, those cells experiencing distress will increase their

production of exosomes, which pick up relevant bits of nucleic acid and proteins and lipids

and package them in a little virus-like package, which those exosomes then travel to different

parts of the body and are excreted in sweat, in the breath, in the urine and so on. And

so we are creating things that function like viruses and look like viruses and are made

in the same system in the cell that replicate viruses. So I think the people that deny that

there is such a thing as a virus are really just helping to call attention to the probable

origin of all viruses was the mixture of external transmitted nucleic acids, basically transmitted,

excreted and transmitted in the form of exosomes as a natural physiological adaptive process.

Now, aren't the mRNA vaccines essentially an artificial replication of that whole exosome

paradigm, but in a really harmful manner?

Yeah, I don't know how aware the virus people were of exosomes, but that's something that

is completely left out of most of the discussion. In fact, the vaccine nucleic acid, the messenger

RNA can be packaged into exosomes and transmitted to other cells, including our germ cells and

into our sweat and transmitted to people we touch or breathe on.

Speaking of that-

A couple more things on Montagnier. He said as early as March, 2020, that the virus is

most certainly man-made after having studied it for a couple of months. And he basically

said this virus contains sequences that are not known to occur in any natural virus of

the same category of the coronavirus, including a protein sequence that is known to be part

of the HIV virus. And then of course, immediately French press started publishing articles saying

he must have run out of his anti-psychotic medication.

Yeah, what they're doing now, the last two or three days, I think they've created another

crazy story claiming that he says all the vaccinated people will be dead within two

years just to make him sound crazy. He didn't say that, but by inserting that claiming that

he said that they're denaturing, defanging his actual message that the virus was deliberate

and stupid and dangerous.

What about his other message from the same interview, which he said that having a vaccination

campaign during pandemic is absolutely the dumbest thing a public health agency can do

because it's actually causing the virus to mutate in order to avoid the vaccine and evolve.

And that's what's creating the new "variants". And in fact, it's making people more susceptible

to dying from these new variants due to the antibody dependent enhancement process.

Yeah, that's the sort of thing he says that they want to shut up by making him sound crazy.

Do you think there's any truth to that? Basically, that these people are now more susceptible

to dying from future encountering either another coronavirus or any virus really? Because you

said something similar about the flu vaccines, that some of the deaths from coronavirus were

following flu vaccination campaigns.

Yeah, but several studies have shown that people who were vaccinated for influenza the

following season were much, much more likely to catch a coronavirus. So you become partially

immune to influenza, but instead you substitute increased susceptibility to coronavirus infection.

So the whole thing, all of the facts invalidate the claims both about influenza vaccines and

the COVID.

So which one do you think is a bigger worry for a vaccinated person? The chronic inflammatory

state, which these vaccines will probably trigger and keep for a long time, potentially

for life and even transgenerational, or the potential for ADE when this person encounters

another virus later on in their life?

The risk of exaggerated antibody intensification of symptoms, the risk is so great that even

though we don't know how often it's going to happen, it's just a very crazy risk to

take for the world population.

So these people could die 10 years from now when they encounter a completely different

virus and of course you'll never be tied back to the vaccine they got 10 years ago.

Yeah.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the Israel-Palestine stuff, but one question I have for you about

that is why, and maybe this is wrong, but why doesn't Israel give the Palestinians vaccines?

Or is it some kind of reverse psychology thing that they're withholding vaccines from?

Part of the truth is probably that like American, black people often look at the history of

what the CDC has done experimenting on black people, experimenting in other countries,

doing experiments in the guise of vaccine where really they're doing something else.

I think a lot of Palestinians are likewise fearful of being experimented on by the vaccinators.

So that would just be a no-sell immediately, like if Israel was like, "We have vaccines

for Palestinians," they would never accept those?

If I was a Palestinian, I don't think I would.

No, I mean, there's actually documented cases around the world.

I think in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they kicked out representatives of a World Health

Organization because now they're firmly convinced that the vaccines that they're getting, donations

from Western countries are intended to sterilize the population.

And we have now some evidence that the same thing is happening in Africa.

So I don't think it's just the Palestinians that are mistrustful.

It's kind of like a third world being always suspicious of the rich people and their attempts

to provide benefit to the poor plebs.

They will never take that openly.

Right.

I kind of understand why the elites here would want to depopulate the US, but why would they

want to do that in Israel?

Oh, well, they're set on getting rid of the Palestinians.

But why would Israel vaccinate its own citizens if the higher-ups, assuming that they understand

that this vaccine is to harm people?

I'm not sure what they understand.

So Netanyahu doesn't think it's possible that he doesn't know it's for depopulation?

I think that's possible.

In other words, the elite may be sometimes stupid and not know that what they have unleashed

on themselves.

Is that what I'm hearing?

Yeah, the elite isn't unified.

On a world scale, they're unified in the sense of being a ruling class with its own interest.

But within that power system, there are constant subdivisions of power conflicts.

And so you have to look at each country's power elite and how it relates to the others.

So like Maxwell doesn't care about some Israeli citizen that, I don't know, shine shoes or

something, just as much as a Rockefeller doesn't care about an American.

Kind of the same type of thing?

Yeah.

The European Jews have a very race-like discrimination against the Jews of other origins, especially

African-originating Jews.

Interesting.

Okay, so we have about eight minutes left.

Is there anything that we should navigate to quickly before calling it a day?

You know what, though?

Let me answer that question that I just said.

What do you think about the ousting or throwing under the bus Bill Gates?

I haven't heard much about what's going on.

Well, he was framed as a womanizer and then Melinda and him got a divorce and now his

name is like the media is all over him as a bad person.

It has been coming out gradually ever since Epstein killed himself, supposedly.

The story was involving Bill Clinton and lots of the elite out political crowd and he was

in it right from an early stage.

It just takes time to develop.

I know that, but do you think he was impeding kind of their goals?

Like he has such a bad reputation now that they're like, "We need to do something

to get this guy off the air," or something like that?

I know I'm asking you to speculate, but it just seems so odd that they turn on...

Like that Epstein stuff has been around for a very long time and then the media just automatically

picks up on it now.

Like, it doesn't make any sense.

I think the media are in turmoil.

They are confused by things leaking out that shouldn't have, and I think they are in the

process of reorganizing and trying to find a new equilibrium that can be sustained, but

everything does seem to be falling apart.

Yeah, I saw an article.

It was in Russia Today, which not many people read, but basically they're saying that Western

media is largely collapsing due to...

Also I mean, no pun intended, collapsing viewings and readings from the general population.

Nobody seems to be going to mainstream media anymore.

I mean, an increasingly smaller percentage of people are reading it, which means less

ad revenue, and unless the government starts to pay the media directly to subsidize them,

they don't really have a survival plan.

Yeah, I think those forces are really stirring up confusion in the mass media on different

sides.

Okay, absolute last thing, and then I'll read the super chats.

Ray, I feel like the olive oil on the carrot or mushrooms is like a revelation.

I think it works so much better than coconut oil, and so I just want to...

I think my digestion is the best it's ever been, and the only thing that I can think

of that I changed was the olive oil.

Does that make sense?

Yeah, I noticed the same thing.

There are allergenic properties in coconut that even extreme refining can miss, but olive

oil in the unrefined state, it's a fruit oil, not a seed oil.

And as such, it brings with the oil a lot of anti-inflammatory, very protective intestinal

redesigning and protecting drug effects.

One last food question for me, because since you brought up the food thing.

Ray, I noticed you've commented in the past on orange peel as being very high in things

like naringenin, hisperidin, et cetera, et cetera.

What are your thoughts on orange peel wax, which is available as basically food grade

material and it's got this really dark red, almost brownish color, which makes me think

it's very, very high.

It's a concentrated form, basically, dietary form of all of these flavonoids.

What was it called?

Orange peel wax.

It consists of about 50 to 60% of polycorsonil basically, but its color is very dark red,

almost like a brick, which makes me think it's high in these flavonoids that we know

have protective effects.

It sounds good.

I'll find out more about it.

But meanwhile, marmalade tastes very good and has those same things.

So does the pulp need to be removed?

It's only basically a thin scraping of the peel?

Is that what's the beneficial part?

Pretty much the whole thing, the white stuff as well as the orange stuff, has those flavonoids.

Okay.

So here are the donations.

My computer doesn't start.

Okay.

Let me do one more advertisement for Ray here.

The newsletter is available by email now.

It's $28.

You can send it to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And then you can purchase progesterone, Progeste from Keenogen by emailing Catherine at keenogen@gmail.com.

And each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

Okay.

That is the last thing.

Ray, any parting words?

And Georgie, any parting words?

Not really.

I mean, I'm glad that the narrative is falling apart and hopefully the elite will consume

itself and not force us to take matters into our own hands.

Well, okay.

Ray, stay on the line.

We'll just keep you for one minute extra.

Guys, thank you so much.

Give this episode a like, share it online, et cetera.

We have an amazing listenership.

Sincerely appreciate it.

These are always extremely fun to do.

Sincere thanks to Ray, sincere thanks to Georgie for making these possible and our amazing

audience for also making it possible.

Thanks everybody.

Take care.
