## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome everyone. This is Josh Rubin from East West Healing and Performance. Jeannie and Ray will be joining us in a couple of minutes. It’s been a little bit of trouble getting Ray back on, but I think the break was good and we have a good show ahead of us on milk, calcium, and hormones. It is a big topic. We have Ray for anywhere from 60 to 120 minutes.

If you want to learn more about Ray Peat, you can visit his website at raypeat.com. Ray has a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon. He specializes in physiology and has taught at many schools around the U.S. and in Mexico, as well as doing private nutritional counseling. He started his work with progesterone-related hormones back in 1968.

Today’s show is on milk, calcium, and hormones. We will be talking about dairy, the degradation of it, where it comes from, and why Ray recommends so much of it based on his work. We will talk about calcium, blood labs, parathyroid hormone, and how we keep those levels regulated to downregulate inflammation.

*(Ray Peat and Jeannie Rubin join the call)*

**Josh Rubin:** How's it going, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, good.

**Josh Rubin:** Did you want to add anything before we start the show in regards to yourself or the topic?

## The History of Milk & Strontium 90

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been interested in milk for a long time, probably 55 years or so. I've been studying the cultural antagonisms to it. In the 1950s, the government had been collecting samples of organisms from around the world to monitor the effects of the atom bomb tests. They wanted to know how it was accumulating in young people, so they started collecting baby teeth. The isotope that concentrated most in teeth happened to be Strontium 90.

After they had been doing that for years, it came out that Strontium 90 was causing leukemia in children, among other cancers. When that got into the news, people said, "Baby teeth show the radioactive isotope, which is similar to calcium. Milk is rich in calcium, so milk is probably the main place babies are getting their Strontium 90." A whole wave went through the culture for a few years advising people not to drink milk because of the Strontium 90.

However, already in 1956 or 1957, people had analyzed the composition of diets. They found that the fallout into the soil produced quite a high ratio of Strontium 90 to available calcium. Plants extracted the calcium, since that was what their cells needed, but left behind a good proportion of the strontium. When cows ate the vegetation, they again extracted a high proportion of calcium and filtered out a lot of strontium.

When you add up the essential nutrients, if you get them from vegetable matter rather than milk, you are getting extremely high concentrations of the fallout isotopes. Milk is a good filtering process to eliminate all kinds of contaminants. Especially in a period of high radiation, it filters out the radioactive isotopes.

**Josh Rubin:** There are so many people out there that say, "Stay away from it because we're not cows," or others who say, "You should only drink raw milk; pasteurized milk is bad." Why do you think there is so much degradation of milk itself, and why are we seeing so many allergies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Actually, the United States cleaned up the commercial dairy industry 40 or 50 years ago. They cut out the use of the most dangerous insecticides that had been getting into the milk and were known to cause breast cancer. In the 60s, the EPA and FDA banned the use of these insecticides around cows and dairies. Israel was slower than the US to ban one of these insecticides, but when they did in the 60s, their breast cancer rate plunged tremendously. The US led the world in cleaning up the milk supply, far ahead of cleaning up the meat supply. When you look at the agricultural industry in general, dairy is still probably the cleanest food available.

## Plant Stress & Chitinase

**Josh Rubin:** In your milk article, you talked about plants producing enzymes when stressed. How do you pronounce it? Chitinase?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chitinase. That is something you find in foods grown in stressed plants. It is a plant enzyme that is protective against insects, but it is strongly allergenic to animals. In small amounts, it is produced in a stressed animal under the influence of estrogen. It's possible that is a factor in meat, eggs, and milk, but probably not in a practical sense.

The main allergens that get into the milk come from cows grazing on pastures that have lots of allergenic weeds. Enough of the allergens go right into the milk that people can react. You can usually taste the funny food in the milk. If you go around the cow's pasture, see what it's eating, and squeeze some of the leaves, you'll often identify what gives the milk a funny flavor. Some small dairies aren't very alert to what their cows are eating, and that can cause an individual dairy's milk to be more allergenic than average.

## Lactose Intolerance & Adaptation

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding intolerances, everyone says, "I'm intolerant to dairy." I know you talk about how having a damaged metabolism or blood sugar handling issues can create the mechanism in the GI system to create the intolerance. Can you talk about the validity of the food intolerance lab tests?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tests for allergens are really just a very vague indicator of the fact that your immune system reacts to everything you are exposed to. Usually, finding antibodies to a particular substance means that you have become tolerant to that substance. I just don't pay any attention to the lab tests for allergies.

The intestine adjusts its enzymes within just a few weeks. Usually, it only takes two weeks to have a complete adaptation of the digestive enzymes. Until your intestine has adjusted its enzymes to a new kind of diet, much of that food is going to be undigested and will feed bacteria rather than feeding the person. The strange new growth of bacteria will produce chemicals that can be toxic and allergenic. If a person isn't used to eating vegetables and they eat them, they'll often get a sore throat, runny nose, sore joints, or headaches. Much of the food sensitivity issue is just failing to adapt because they change their diet too suddenly.

**Jeannie Rubin:** So you're saying when somebody introduces milk back into the diet, they should take it very slowly to allow the body to adapt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even if a person does have lactose intolerance from a lactase deficiency, tests have found that if they drink a cup per meal or less, they don't have the diarrhea that could be produced by drinking a pint of milk on an empty stomach. Even if biopsies show a deficiency of the lactase enzyme, that can be induced in about two weeks just by introducing an occasional small amount of milk. The cells sense the presence of a nutrient and the enzymes are gradually induced until the intestine can handle normal amounts.

Bacterial infections and inflammation can cause the loss of lactase enzymes and probably many other important digestive enzymes. Experiments with supplementing thyroid or progesterone have found that you can induce or restore the lactase that has been deficient just by increasing those anti-stress hormones.

**Josh Rubin:** Does that have to do with their effect on increasing metabolism, regulating blood sugar, and downregulating estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Inflammation is probably the basic problem there. Thyroid and progesterone, by restoring energy and normal function, bypass the inflammatory processes. Inflammation shifts the cell function to an emergency state, and you tend to lose a lot of functional enzymes in an inflamed state.

## Benefits of Milk vs. Alternatives

**Josh Rubin:** Why do you feel dairy is so important?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Part of it is the alternatives. In 1960, the main focus against milk was its Strontium 90 content. But when you look at the alternatives, it turned out milk was the best food for avoiding Strontium 90. It's the same with industrial additives and accidental pollutants. Just about every place you look in the food industry, things are far worse than milk. Some fruits, if you can find fruits that aren't grown in large-scale industrial orchards, are okay. Bananas are an example of one of the worst products for chemical use, but if you can find unstressed fruits, those are very free of toxins relative to most other food products.

**Josh Rubin:** It would be safe to say dairy is like a complete macronutrient—carbs, protein, fat—and very balanced regarding blood sugar and inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it even contains some testosterone. Thyroid, progesterone, and testosterone are important for the young animal. In human milk, they found there was enough thyroid hormone that babies whose thyroids were destroyed by living near Three Mile Island during the accident didn't suffer symptoms of hypothyroidism as long as they were being breastfed.

## Calcium & Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)

**Jeannie Rubin:** Can you elaborate on how calcium and the parathyroid work together in assisting the body with chronic stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a subject for a week of seminars. It involves everything at every level of the organism. Calcium is potentially the thing that causes all of the problems—allergies, cancer, heart attacks—but when calcium is regulated properly, it protects against all of those things.

One of the central things in regulating calcium is the parathyroid hormone (PTH). When you are deficient in calcium in your foods, your PTH increases. It can temporarily keep your blood calcium up to the proper level, but it does that by taking it out of the bones. When you eat an excess of calcium, that tends to suppress the PTH.

Since they've been doing dialysis for kidney disease, we've gained better insight into how PTH works. They found that if they remove the parathyroid gland entirely, they can solve many of the deadly effects of chronic kidney dialysis. Hypertension and insomnia, for example, are immediately corrected by removing the parathyroid gland.

When you look at the effects of PTH excess in dialysis patients, you get an idea of the range of things that eating extra calcium can correct by suppressing the hormone. Insomnia is just one of them. Probably everywhere calcium is involved in an excitatory, inflammation-promoting way, you can reverse it just by increasing the calcium in your diet.

Two vitamins are important for making the tissue handle calcium properly and lowering PTH: Vitamin K and Vitamin D. Other nutrients, like Vitamin A and niacinamide, work in the same direction, helping to balance the ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

When they put animals on a Vitamin D deficient diet, giving the animal sugar instead of starch will keep its bones from developing rickets. It isn't that sugar has a Vitamin D action; it lowers the stress and makes the animal adapt better to the deficiency. If there's a calcium deficiency, letting the animal drink salty water will make up for it by helping the kidneys retain calcium, apparently by substituting loss of sodium for loss of calcium.

**Josh Rubin:** Why do so many people think that because their blood calcium levels are low, they need to pump calcium? You're saying we need to downregulate PTH first. Can you take too much calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I often see people with a blood calcium of 11, 12, or 13 (when it should be 9 or 10). By getting them to eat *more* calcium, and maybe take Vitamin D and K, they can very quickly get their calcium down to normal. The reason it is high is generally because they are eating too much phosphate and overdriving their parathyroid hormone.

**Josh Rubin:** Could eating a lot of muscle meats and tryptophan create the facilitation of PTH?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, many things increase the parathyroid. Serotonin has a direct action. Estrogen, cortisol, and prolactin all have promoting effects on PTH. Progesterone and thyroid are the main things that help to inhibit it.

## Carbon Dioxide & Baking Soda

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Part of the inhibition is that carbon dioxide (CO2) produced in the cell forces calcium to leave the cell. That relaxes the cell because calcium should be outside the cell. When it's inside, it tends to excite the cell and cause inflammation and lactic acid production. Once you get the streaming flow of CO2 out of the cell, you're getting calcium into the safe situation.

PTH activates glycolysis and the formation of lactic acid. That is a big part of how it dissolves the bone to provide calcium for the bloodstream. Everything that shifts the balance away from lactic acid production and towards CO2 production helps get the calcium back into the bloodstream, out of cells, and ready to go back into the bones.

When they do tissue culture of a mouse skull, PTH tends to dissolve it, causing it to produce lactic acid. But if you increase the CO2, it directly starts forming crystals of calcium carbonate and restoring the mineral structure of the bone.

**Josh Rubin:** Can we use things like baking soda or carbonated water to facilitate that process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The exchange between bicarbonate and CO2 is so quick that when you give a person a dose of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), the exchange to CO2 is quick at the cell surface of a stressed cell. You can actually acidify and restore a stressed cell to normal with baking soda. The sodium will quickly get lost out the urine, leaving the body acidified with the intracellular CO2, which puts the cell back into its anti-inflammatory resting state.

**Josh Rubin:** You mean actually ingesting the baking soda?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, or salty water. Sometimes that does the same thing because it lets you rearrange the balance of your alkaline minerals.

## Raw vs. Pasteurized Milk

**Josh Rubin:** You talk about how some people can't handle raw milk and you actually recommend pasteurized for them. Can you elaborate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every cow has its particular balance of bacteria. A healthy cow will have a very high bacteria count in its milk, and the individual cow will change its bacterial balance according to what it's eating and the season. It's extremely variable. If a person has a bad reaction to some of the bacteria they're getting from the cow, they can try a different dairy.

Even pasteurized milk still has enough of these individual herd bacteria that trying a different brand is sometimes all it takes. I know a few people who get gas or diarrhea from most supermarket milks, but if they drink only the ultra-pasteurized milk—which has been heated to about 135 degrees Fahrenheit—they tolerate that nicely. Ultra-pasteurized milk has somewhat lower vitamin content and doesn't taste as good, but some people do tolerate it better.

## Yogurt & Carrageenan

**Josh Rubin:** What about yogurts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first concern is to make sure it doesn't contain carrageenan and gums. Those are showing up in more and more foods, especially yogurt, kefir, and cheeses. I've seen products intended to add Vitamin A and D to milk that contained a gum, such as alginate or carrageenan.

If it says it's just fermented milk or yogurt, that's the safest kind. Still, it's better not to eat more than a few spoonfuls per day because any lactic acid—especially the kind formed by bacteria—is extra work for your liver. Lactic acid activates the fibrosis-producing system, stimulating collagen production. Chronic exposure increases a general tendency toward inflammation and aging. The immediate effect on the liver is that it consumes glucose to turn lactic acid back into glucose. It is basically a drain on your blood sugar reserves.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on carrageenan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They can inject a solution of carrageenan into roast beef. You can increase the weight of your product and decrease the meat content by 30% by plumping it up with this jelly made from seaweed. This stuff is analogous to our connective tissue and the breakdown material in the bloodstream, heparin. It's a sulfated polysaccharide. It can be interpreted as a sign of damage to our own connective tissue, causing acute immune reactions. It is used experimentally to cause inflammation in research.

The use of it in food is justified by experiments showing that native carrageenan doesn't induce cancer. But if you allow bacteria to break down the carrageenan into smaller fragments, that *will* cause cancer. Our intestine contains bacteria able to do that breakdown.

## Saturated Fats & Iron

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about dairy regarding saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A liver disease research group led by A.A. Nanji has demonstrated a curative effect on hepatitis and cirrhosis from adding saturated fats—from coconut oil through butter fats up to the waxy long-chain saturated fats. Similarly, they have shown that fish oils and seed oils (polyunsaturated fats or PUFAs) exacerbate liver diseases. Just by substituting saturated fats, you have an anti-inflammatory effect.

**Josh Rubin:** Dairy is low in iron, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. During pregnancy, estrogen causes the mother to absorb more iron. A woman will typically absorb nine or 10 times as much iron as a man. The fetus accumulates iron partly from estrogen exposure and partly from the oxygen deficit in the womb. The baby is born overcharged with iron and doesn't need to eat any iron for about six months to a year. Milk is designed to let the baby grow into its potentially toxic overcharge with iron.

Men, by the time they're 50, are generally overloaded with iron, which contributes to free radical oxidation, heart disease, and liver disease. Women are protected as long as they are menstruating. Milk and cheese are deficient in iron, so adding them to the diet helps prevent that chronic tendency to overcharge on iron.

## Cheese & Whey Protein

**Josh Rubin:** What about cheeses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Recently I saw an advertisement stating that 60-some percent of cheeses now made use commercial cultures. These are cheap bacterial and fungal substitutes for the naturally grown cultures. Traditionally, cheese is made with bovine digestive enzymes (rennet) to clot the cheese. Now they are using fungal and bacterial substitutes. Almost all commercial cheeses are risky because of those microorganisms, besides any additives for texture.

**Josh Rubin:** What about whey protein powders?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40 or 50 years ago, cheese factories would give their fresh liquid whey to hog farmers. It produced healthy pigs. But when it is sold as a powder, the process of dehydrating it oxidizes the protein. Milk products are high in fragile amino acids like tryptophan and cysteine. Dehydrating increases the oxidation, toxicity, and allergenicity. I don't recommend any dehydrated food except in emergencies.

The casein in cheese turns out to be anti-inflammatory and anti-stress. You get the opposite effect from the whey fraction. Also, most of the calcium stays with the cheese. So with whey, you have a protein which is easily degraded, lacks anti-stress factors, and is deficient in calcium.

## Milk & Weight Loss

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the arguments against milk is that it makes people fat. But research shows milk is probably the best reducing food there is. The calcium alone is a very important metabolic regulator; it inhibits the fat-forming enzyme, fatty acid synthase. At the same time, it activates the uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria, which burn calories faster and protect against free radical oxidation. Milk is the only food that does both of those things simultaneously.

**Josh Rubin:** What about the synthetic vitamins in pasteurized milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a very small amount. Even though I'm allergic to synthetic Vitamin A—just a trace gives me a headache—I can drink a gallon of milk containing their added Vitamin A. Apparently, other things in the milk protect me from that reaction.

**Josh Rubin:** You drink a gallon of milk a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's been my average for 35 years or so. I probably average two to three quarts now when I can get lots of orange juice.

**Josh Rubin:** Ideally, where do you get your calories?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ideally, I would get half my calories from fruit. The proportion of protein, carbohydrate, and fat should probably be something like a third of each. If you avoid starch, polyunsaturated fats, and high-tryptophan proteins, you could go very high on any one of the major nutrients without problem.

## Osteoporosis & Bone Health

**Josh Rubin:** Can a high protein diet create the overstimulation of parathyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because most protein comes with lots of phosphate. Grains, beans, and meats are high in phosphate. The ratio between phosphate and calcium is the main thing that activates the PTH. Minimizing phosphate or increasing calcium is extremely important.

**Josh Rubin:** Does estrogen and cortisol play a part in demineralization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When estrogen is dominant, PTH is highest. Prolactin and cortisol also increase PTH. All of these are known to dissolve bones. It's interesting that they promote estrogen as a bone strengthener, yet in the 50 or 60 years women have been using estrogen, the rate of breaking hips has increased.

**Josh Rubin:** Progesterone would play a factor in rebuilding bone, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and testosterone. The same factors that interrupt progesterone metabolism also interrupt testosterone. High tryptophan, serotonin, or polyunsaturated fats will lower your testosterone. Testosterone protects against the parathyroid hormone and strengthens the bones.

## Eggshell Calcium

**Josh Rubin:** What are some other nutritional sources of calcium besides dairy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eggshells. If you boil your eggs to get additives off them, eggshells are the purest form of calcium carbonate. They are even cleaner than oyster shells.

**Josh Rubin:** How would you recommend ingesting them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pulverize them into a powder. Take a fourth to a half teaspoon if a person is not getting their milk calcium.

**Josh Rubin:** What about aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin blocks the prostaglandins that cause inflammation related to PTH. It also inhibits pituitary stress hormones, lowering cortisol and estrogen. This works to strengthen bones and keep calcium out of blood vessels.

## Caller: Fluoride

**Caller 1:** I haven't seen anything about fluoride on your site. Where is fluoride on your radar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I avoid fluoridated water carefully. During a stay in San Francisco, I wasn't aware the water was fluoridated and I started getting extreme hypothyroid symptoms. The fluoride destroyed the thyroid supplement I was taking. It just takes one fluoride atom to ruin the T3 molecule. It acts as a thyroid toxin. Also, studies by Yiamouyiannis and Burk showed that fluoridated populations have a higher cancer rate.

## Caller: Acne & Vitamin A

**Caller 2:** I've noticed an increase in acne when I consume dairy. I'm 24 years old.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect the connection is that dairy is increasing your metabolic rate and increasing your requirement for nutrients. Usually, Vitamin A is the limiting nutrient. Calcium is a powerful stimulant to metabolism. The increased metabolic rate makes you consume Vitamin A.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend rubbing Vitamin A on the skin or ingesting it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I used commercial Vitamin A for years, but they change the products and additives can cause sensitivity. I found that every time I worked outside in the summer or slept with a bright light, I got acne. Light activates the hormonal system and consumes Vitamin A. If I increased Vitamin A in proportion to light exposure, I could prevent acne.

However, giant doses (several hundred thousand units) can suppress your thyroid. Carotenes (plant source) are even more anti-thyroid. You have to be cautious, starting with 5,000 units and watching for allergic symptoms. Very often people have to get up to 20,000 or 30,000 units a day before acne improves.

**Josh Rubin:** The plant source is more toxic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because it depends on Vitamin B12 to be converted, and thyroid function is inhibited if it isn't converted. One serving of liver a week and an egg or two every day is usually plenty of Vitamin A.

## Caller: Milk & Phosphate Ratio

**Caller 3:** Anti-milk articles argue that milk drains calcium because it has a higher phosphorus-to-calcium ratio than the human body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the ratio in milk is very high towards calcium. Even if you eat meat (high phosphate), drinking a good amount of milk will put those phosphates into proportion. It should be 1.5 calcium per phosphate anyway. Milk is, next to eggshells, our best source of calcium.

## Caller: Trans Fats & CLA

**Caller 1 (Returning):** There is word that dairy is a source of natural trans fats. Is there a difference between natural and synthetic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you heard about Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)? It is sold therapeutically because it is anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity. That is a natural component of milk fat. The trans fats in dairy are just in the process of forming CLA.

The benefit is that they block polyunsaturated fats (linoleic acid). Linoleic acid is the anti-thyroid, pro-cancer, pro-inflammatory fatty acid. The dairy trans fats are precursors to CLA. Bacteria in the cow's rumen hydrogenate the fats to detoxify the polyunsaturated fats from the vegetation. If the cow eats a natural diet rich in Vitamin E, the bacteria turn unsaturated fats to saturated. The small amount of intermediate material turns out to be trans fats and CLA, which have a protective effect.

**Caller 1:** So is that different than partially hydrogenated oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil still has a lot of PUFA left in it, which has toxic effects.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, do you have anything you want to elaborate on before we shut it down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, no.

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, we really appreciate you taking the time. Thanks for tuning in, everyone. Have a great weekend.
