## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Alrighty, welcome back to a great show with Dr. Ray Peat. Today we're going to do a question and answer session. I know a lot of you have been awaiting this type of show. Jeannie's not going to be on the call today; it's just going to be me once again.

Let's get back to Ray Peat. He has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at many schools, from the University of Oregon to Montana State University, to naturopathic schools in Mexico. You can take a look at his website at RayPeat.com to learn more about him and his background. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968.

Ray, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Josh Rubin:** I think the first question everyone keeps emailing me about is: do you have a timeline when you're going to start taking new subscribers to the newsletter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think we changed that notice and they are available now.

**Josh Rubin:** Okay, there you go. If you want to sign up, go to his website, RayPeat.com.

## Probiotics and Gut Health

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of people out there are so gung-ho crazy about probiotics. That's all you hear: "People have gas? Take probiotics. Anything wrong? Take probiotics." You don't really talk too much about probiotics. Can you elaborate on your thoughts about them, specifically Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are probably okay to try. One thing that has made me skeptical about them was an article published in *Nature* probably 35 or 40 years ago. It showed that there are antigenic regions on these lactobacilli that exactly match proteins associated with female reproductive action. From puberty to menopause, roughly, there's the risk of having an autoimmune or immunological interaction between intestinal bacteria and body tissues. There hasn't been much follow-up on that, but that is the period when autoimmune-type problems show up in women. Estrogen is probably the main factor involved in that, but it just happens that there is this antigen parallel between the bacteria and the person.

The bacteria do have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the membranes of the intestine, but one problem is that they produce lactic acid. If you provide them with enough fuel, they can produce lactic acid, which is a potential toxin. It stimulates inflammation and the formation of collagen fibrosis.

**Josh Rubin:** I think that's the biggest thing for everyone to understand—that Lactobacillus is lactate-producing. If you take it and you don't need it, you're actually causing more of a problem than helping yourself.

## Fasting and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** From a health perspective, is there any time you would recommend fasting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies in which rheumatoid arthritis and similar things are completely relieved during a week-long fast. But then it would come back as soon as the person eats again. That's partly because your cortisol increases tremendously when you're not eating. What the cortisol is doing is converting your muscle tissue into fuel to live on. At the same time, it's having an anti-inflammatory effect.

However, the bowel is really the basic cause of most degenerative inflammatory diseases. So there is a good reason for thinking that fasting is therapeutic. I've seen animals with huge tumors that just refuse to eat. If their owners let them sit around not eating, they would recover and live for years. The lack of appetite during sickness is a natural opportunity to fast.

Since the bowel is so connected to inflammatory diseases—producing lactic acid, endotoxin, and a tremendous amount of serotonin—if you can lighten the inflammation load in the intestine, you can achieve the same thing as fasting while still absorbing nutrients. You just have to do it in a way that doesn't produce endotoxin, lactic acid, or serotonin excess. Partly, that means using a very easily digested diet, avoiding undercooked vegetable matter that can't be digested by human enzymes, and having other easily digested or slightly antimicrobial foods. Raw carrots or boiled bamboo shoots, for example, have germicides that prevent bacterial growth.

## Evolutionary Diets and Brain Metabolism

**Caller:** It's really popular these days to approach eating based on what we evolved to eat, like the blood type diet and the paleo diet. What do you think about this approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That whole approach assumes that we really know what the species ate while evolving. There are a lot of fantasy theories. Whatever people enjoy eating, they tend to read into the history of human evolution. No one is really sure what people were eating.

There is direct present experimental evidence that supports fruit eating better than some of the currently popular ideas, such as Cunnane's ideas about fish eating. I think fruit eating was a good candidate for supporting evolution to be more human than ape-like, supporting a big brain and the kind of digestive system we have.

**Caller:** I've noticed that people who are really cerebral or have jobs where they use their brains a lot seem to have a lower tolerance for stress, particularly if they are exercising or doing a low-carb regimen. Do people who place a lot of mental demands on themselves have different nutritional needs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some people have commented that the brain of the average person might weigh 2% of their body weight, but it uses 40% or 50% of their metabolic energy. If a person has a bigger-than-average brain—and human brains vary tremendously in size and metabolic requirements—and if they spend a great amount of mental energy compared to the average, you can see what a tremendous metabolic difference that can make.

**Caller:** Is there a way to attenuate the ill effects of high-intensity interval exercise or heavy weightlifting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was an experiment 30 years ago where they had people walk on a treadmill and didn't let their heart rate go over 120 beats per minute. They measured their active thyroid hormone, T3, at the beginning and after 40 minutes. The average person's T3 had gone to zero in just 40 minutes of moderate exercise.

Normally, as soon as you have some sugar—if your liver had a lot of glycogen—it would replenish the T3 quickly. But the longer the stress is, and the more inhibitors there are in your tissues (like polyunsaturated fats) or bad bacteria in your intestine, the more it delays the recovery of your liver and T3 production. With some people, it just takes a little extra stress to stick you down in that low T3 condition.

**Caller:** Finally, what is your favorite joke? Or barring that, what did you eat yesterday?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What I ate yesterday would be easier than remembering a joke. I had steak—it happened to be rib steak day—eggs, lots of milk, coffee, orange juice, and Coke.

## Schizophrenia and Metabolism

**Caller (Sandy Soto):** I'm calling to know your thoughts on the connection between schizophrenia and hypothyroidism, as well as nutritional deficiencies like niacin and copper. Also, how much does gluten intolerance have to do with that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since the intestine is involved in everything, gluten is one of the basic things that will cause problems once you get sensitized to it. High estrogen is one of the things that sensitizes the intestine and system to gluten. The transglutaminase enzyme is activated by estrogen and activates the immune reactions that can cause celiac disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and is now known to be involved in causing cancer and brain conditions, including schizophrenia.

Stopping the inflammatory process is the basic thing. I think that was behind the orthomolecular approach to treating schizophrenia—the niacin approach. I think [Abram] Hoffer was opening up a whole area of science that is valid: that you can treat schizophrenia metabolically.

One of the basic effects of niacin is to inhibit the release of free fatty acids from our tissue stores. Free fatty acids poison our energy apparatus. You've probably noticed how schizophrenics almost always are heavy smokers. Nicotine happens to have a brain-protective and therapeutic effect against a lot of degenerative inflammatory diseases. I think that's because it overlaps with the niacin pathways that are natural energy producers.

I don't have any particular therapeutic ideas for schizophrenia, but keeping the thyroid function up so that energy is supported, keeping toxins down, and avoiding polyunsaturated fats and intestinal irritants like gluten and indigestible starches will help.

**Caller:** Would you say that hypothyroidism would be the greatest factor in schizophrenia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would guess that the conditions under which it comes on—puberty is a major time for schizophrenia—is when rising hormones very often interfere with thyroid function.

## Coconut Sugar and Parasites

**Caller:** What about coconut sugar? Is that an okay sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never tried it, but if it's extracted from the sap or the core of the tree, it's likely fine. If it's made from the starch chemically, I would have to know the process. If it starts with a natural sugar extract, it's going to be fine. But if it's processed heavily with heat and chemical catalysts, it can leave irritating residues.

**Caller:** What is your approach to parasites?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the kind. The old-timers 100 years ago commonly used a spoonful of flowers of sulfur maybe once a year. A huge dose like that will pretty much clean out any kind of parasite. I've experimented with very small amounts of flowers of sulfur; it has a fungicidal effect. If there's a mild yeast infection, a pinch a day for two or three days will clear that out. Sometimes that is enough to discourage amoebas and worms. It's very safe for people in small amounts.

**Caller:** Is it possible that parasites could contribute to autoimmune functions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people think they have a beneficial effect on the immune system, but I'm not convinced. I'm inclined toward the Metchnikov side, which sees the immune system as a developmental process rather than specific chemotherapy against organisms. In Africa, for example, a lot of the so-called AIDS is really just from being exposed to too many stimulants of the immune system.

## Excessive Sweating

**Josh Rubin:** What could it mean if someone is just sweating all the time, even from an early age?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes it's a developmental overbalance of the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous system. Either way can activate your sweat glands. Sometimes hypothyroid people compensate with extremely high adrenaline production, and that can cause sweating even when they're not hot.

## Parasites and Thyroid Connection

**Caller:** I believe I picked up parasites in 2006 while swimming. I had symptoms similar to low thyroid and tested positive for Hashimoto's. Years later, I passed a two-foot tapeworm. I'm still having digestion and energy problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you had tests specifically looking for various parasites?

**Caller:** The first tapeworm tests came back negative even though I was putting segments of worms in the stool samples.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are doctors who specialize in that, especially in coastal tropical areas.

**Josh Rubin:** I would recommend Metametrix (GI Effects profile).

**Caller:** Is there anything to look at for restoring digestive function if I get rid of the parasites?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Diet to keep your metabolic rate up, and if necessary, a thyroid supplement. If your metabolic rate is low, you'll tend to get infections. Fungal infections really tend to specialize in hypothyroid people. It's the same with intestinal parasites; the IgA antibodies on membranes in the intestine are deficient in people who are low thyroid, so all membranes are susceptible to attack.

## Fungal Infections and Sugar

**Josh Rubin:** There is so much in our industry about fungal infections. Doug Kaufmann promotes the fungal diet, saying mycotoxins feed on sugar, so take out sugar to starve them. I know you have a different view.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I used to read about people who got drunk when they ate sugar because yeast were growing in their stomach. Their digestive enzymes were so weak that the organisms weren't killed by stomach acid. But getting drunk is really the only major harm done by that. The real problem is that their digestion is poor from being low thyroid. Taking thyroid to activate digestive enzymes would probably spontaneously get rid of the yeast.

René Dubos did experiments showing that when yeast in the intestine is starved for sugar, it sends out pseudo-hyphae filaments long enough to reach through the intestine wall to get sugar from the bloodstream. They actually become invasive when starved. If you feed them sugar, they don't put out those adhesive, invasive filaments. So a sugarless diet is really a dangerous thing for someone with a yeast problem.

Also, when you avoid sugar, you risk not giving your liver the sugar it needs to activate the thyroid hormone, making the hypothyroid problem worse. Fungus loves unsaturated fat but can be killed by saturated fats.

## Liver Cleansing and Swollen Feet

**Caller:** What is your feeling on liver flushes and general cleansing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were experiments on cattle showing that while 30-35% had toxins in muscle and fat, only 6-7% had toxins in their liver. The liver has the equipment for excreting toxins. It is the cleanest organ. If you slow down the liver's activity—which happens in a fast—your brain and other organs are exposed to chemicals diffusing out of your fat and muscles. The best cleansing diet is one that increases your liver's action. Tasty food, sugar, and thyroid are the main things that activate the liver.

**Caller:** What about swollen feet in a relatively young person?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They probably also have puffy eyelids and faces when they wake up. That's from excess permeability of their blood vessels. Water leaks out into the tissues. Sometimes all it takes is eating enough salt to make your albumin function to bind water and keep it in your blood vessels. People on a low-salt diet are very susceptible to that.

In pregnancy or premenstrually, high estrogen and low thyroid make blood vessels permeable. Albumin can't retain sodium. In one experiment with women with toxemia, they gave them over 20 grams of salt extra per day and almost immediately cured their symptoms.

## Fructose vs. Starch

**Josh Rubin:** There's a lot of bad hype about fructose being turned into fat. Why do you recommend utilizing fruits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ideal amount of fructose seems to be maybe a third as much as glucose. What fructose does in the cell is raise the metabolic rate, increase the production of carbon dioxide, and catalyze the ability to burn glucose. It's a catalyst that increases cell activity in constructive ways.

Experiments comparing sugar or Coke to starch found that sugar improved calcium assimilation, increased metabolic rate, and decreased obesity. There was something like a 50% increase in the ability to burn calories with a sucrose-based diet. The calcium-sparing effect of sucrose or fructose comes from that metabolic stimulating effect, imitating active thyroid hormone which produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide keeps calcium in the bones where it should be.

## Tryptophan, Spices, and Thyroid Dosing

**Caller:** If a person is healthy, is the majority of tryptophan converted to niacin? Can they eat muscle meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The high phosphorus content in meat is important. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus should be very high. If you're under stress, phosphate becomes more of a problem. Meat and whole grains are major sources of phosphate. You have to be concerned with your calcium intake if you have a meat or grain-based diet. Women are much more susceptible to pellagra because estrogen decreases the production of niacin from tryptophan and sends it down the serotonin pathway.

**Caller:** What about spices? My girlfriend is craving garlic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main problem with onion and garlic is if you're allergic to them. Low thyroid people often have symptoms like gallbladder spasms, especially if the garlic and onion are cooked.

**Caller:** Can you elaborate on Cytomel (T3) and thyroxine (T4) dosing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ideally, the body should make 4 or 5 micrograms of T3 per hour. If you take much more than 10 micrograms at once, your liver activates enzymes to destroy or excrete it. If you take 10 micrograms with a meal, the food delays absorption, so you get maybe 2 or 3 micrograms each hour. That is a smooth way to take it.

Just occasionally, someone might need to get their cholesterol down quickly and use frequent 5 microgram doses. But someone with a heart condition doesn't want to take more than one microgram at a time. The trouble with relying on thyroxine (T4) is that in women, estrogen often keeps the liver from making as much T3 as you need.

**Caller:** Raw vs. cooked foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With animal products, cooking kills parasites. There's no nutritional benefit to cooking meat, but safety is the issue. With fruit like an apple, it contains a huge amount of pectin which isn't digestible by humans but feeds bacteria. Cooking breaks this down.

There was an experiment in the 1940s where rats on a diet of canned vegetables thrived, while those on raw vegetables didn't.

**Caller:** What about enzymes in raw food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The production of pancreatic digestive enzymes isn't a stress; it's a natural function. I don't think there's any benefit to supplementing extra enzymes for the pancreas's sake.

## Low CO2 in Children

**Caller:** My four-year-old had leukemia. His CO2 levels are low (16-19). Doctors want to use bicarbonate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Baking soda (bicarbonate) is very helpful. It helps regulate minerals and can bring up systemic CO2. But the most effective thing is to check the thyroid function, which controls CO2 production. 16 to 19 is too low.

**Caller:** He also has chronic diarrhea. We feed him squash, spinach, green leafy vegetables.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Are the vegetables well cooked? Salads are a problem for lots of people. They cause diarrhea or constipation.

## Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Thyroid

**Caller:** I was diagnosed with MS eight years ago. I get fungal infections, white spots in the throat, itchy skin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most of the first five or six people I saw with an MS diagnosis recovered instantly when they took thyroid. A common symptom of low thyroid is enlargement of the pituitary because of a prolactin-secreting tumor. That can cause pressure on the optic nerve and is often misdiagnosed as brain disease.

In well-diagnosed MS, they know that endotoxin is a very important factor in causing blood vessels in the head to be too permeable. Endotoxin can be drastically reduced just by eating a good-sized raw carrot every day. Getting enough protein (at least 80 grams) is also very important.

## Starting a Pro-Thyroid Diet

**Josh Rubin:** Does the body go through a detox when starting a pro-thyroid diet? Will cholesterol go up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person has low cholesterol, they shouldn't start a thyroid supplement full force. You need cholesterol to make hormones. Fruit is the best way to raise cholesterol.

If you are just starting a diet change, improvement is gradual. The first thing is to lower toxin production in the intestine (cut out undercooked starches/salads, use carrot fiber). Avoid polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) because they block thyroid hormone production.

Rising cholesterol usually means the liver is getting enough energy to make it, and that toxins have gone down. Cholesterol is a protective, adaptive substance. A Framingham study found that people over 50 with cholesterol under 200 were more likely to have dementia.

## Language Learning and Coffee

**Caller:** Any advice for learning a second language?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin B1 and coffee can make a tremendous difference. When I learned French to pass my graduate exam, I did it over a weekend with plenty of coffee and a few hundred milligrams of Vitamin B1. I sat down and memorized 4,000 words. B1 makes you produce energy faster and increases circulation to the brain.

**Caller:** What about phytoestrogens in coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hops in beer are estrogenic. But coffee has many good things; it is a major dietary source of niacin and magnesium.

## Raw Liver and Eggs

**Josh Rubin:** What is the upper limit for raw liver, and what about raw eggs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You're less likely to catch an infection if they're cooked. They should be lightly cooked. Exposure to oxygen breaks down the polyunsaturated fats. Eating them raw doesn't protect you from the PUFA.

**Josh Rubin:** How much liver do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Six ounces once a week is enough. If I eat 6 or 8 ounces of liver with ordinary foods, I often wake up with low blood sugar. I've learned to cook it in a large amount of butter or coconut oil. It's so high in protein that it disturbs blood sugar if you don't have fat and sugar with it.

## LSD and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** What do you think about the therapeutic potential of tryptamine drugs like psilocybin and LSD?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In early studies, patients reported their migraines disappeared after LSD sessions. Migraines were identified as an excess serotonin problem. LSD acted as an antagonist to serotonin.

Because the government demonized hallucinogens, the pharmaceutical industry wanted to distance their antidepressants from them. They created the myth that serotonin is a "happy drug" you want to increase. Actually, it's the misery drug. Excess serotonin produces nausea, diarrhea, high blood pressure, fibrosis, and dementia.

LSD-type drugs imitate serotonin in a way that triggers the feedback system to turn off the nerves that make serotonin. So their basic function is anti-serotonergic. Research is starting up again recognizing that these drugs work by being anti-serotonin.

## Sunscreen, Gelatin, and Wifi

**Caller:** Perspective on sunscreens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some are directly carcinogenic. There is a phobia about ultraviolet light. It's best to get sunlight but avoid sunburn. Experiments on rabbits showed that animals on a saturated fat diet weren't hurt by sunlight, while those on unsaturated fats got sun-damaged skin. The polyunsaturated fats in your skin act like an amplifier for damage. You can apply coconut oil or a solution of aspirin to the skin for protection.

**Caller:** How do you take gelatin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you eat it undissolved, it causes gas. I mix sugar with it, moisten it, heat it until clear, and add orange juice to make gummy candies. Or I use it in mousses or soups.

**Caller:** Is wireless internet a source of radiation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I don't use wireless things; I have wire connections. Cell phones and WiFi are a serious dose of radiation that affects nerve function and probably increases brain cancer incidence.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** That does it for today. Ray, anything new going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My recent email talks about biological processes excluded from science. There are lectures on the internet by Luca Turin on how molecules and cells interact, and Gerald Pollock on the structure of water. It's bringing back "quantum biology"—the idea that interactions of hormones and drugs can be understood on the electronic level rather than the mechanical lock-and-key conception.

**Josh Rubin:** Great show. Thanks for tuning in. Check out our website, EastWestHealing.com. Thanks, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye.
