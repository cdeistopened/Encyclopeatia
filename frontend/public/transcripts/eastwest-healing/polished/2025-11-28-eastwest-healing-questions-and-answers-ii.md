## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** All right everyone, welcome to today's show with Ray Peat, Ph.D. I want to thank everyone for tuning in. Check our website at eastwesthealing.com if you want to learn more about what we do. We have a lot of free information there, including our "Metabolic Blueprint" program launching soon.

Today we are doing a question and answer show with Ray Peat. If you want to learn more about Ray, his website is RayPeat.com. He has tons of articles, books you can order, and a newsletter that is well worth the money. Ray has his Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He started his work with progesterone-related hormones in 1968 and wrote his dissertation in 1972 outlining his ideas regarding progesterone as a protector of the body's structure and energy against the harmful effects of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen.

Ray has been incredibly generous with his time answering emails from listeners. If you feel inclined, sending a donation or a gift to his house to say thank you would be greatly appreciated. Ray, are you on the line?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Josh Rubin:** Is there anything else you want to add before we get going?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that covered everything.

## Iron Toxicity and Estrogen

**Josh Rubin:** I have a lot of questions here. I’ve been getting many questions regarding iron. Could you give a summary of your thoughts on the dangers of iron? You believe it acts like a heavy metal and is toxic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Wherever iron gets loose, it is available to react with things like polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), proteins, and nucleic acids. The reactive form of iron is the reduced *ferrous* form rather than the fully oxidized *ferric* form. This means that if you don't get enough oxygen to your tissues, the iron tends to get reduced by glutathione.

People talk about oxidative stress, but *reductive* stress is really what you have to worry about in relation to iron. Alcohol, for example, interferes with the use of oxygen and causes reduced glutathione to accumulate. This shifts the ratio towards reduction, activates iron by reducing it to the reactive ferrous form, and causes damage.

Iron accumulates faster than it should under the influence of estrogen. Inability to use oxygen properly intensifies the absorption of iron, and that seems to be what estrogen is for—to create the illusion of oxygen deprivation so that you absorb more iron. They’ve tested the absorption of iron in women versus men, and women absorbed nine times as much iron. That is primarily the influence of estrogen.

Unfortunately, besides making the body absorb it, estrogen also tends to create the conditions that make iron toxic. One of the main things that activated iron attacks is polyunsaturated fatty acids. This creates a vicious circle: estrogen increases the most reactive PUFAs, which activate and increase the quantity of estrogen. Both contribute to the activation and intensification of iron toxicity. You can break the cycle by donating blood or doing things to interrupt the estrogen-fatty acid cycle.

**Josh Rubin:** What would be a normal lab value for iron? If you have low hemoglobin, is it safe to donate blood?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is no blood test I know of that will really say anything meaningful about your iron status because iron tends to hide in the liver and bone marrow. The fact that an iron supplement increases red blood cell count or hemoglobin doesn't mean the person was deficient in iron. They used to treat anemia with doses of arsenic; the arsenic creates stress that tells your body you need more iron and blood. Any stress that interferes with oxygen use will drive up the blood production system.

**Josh Rubin:** When you see low hemoglobin, would that be due to estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In all animals that have estrogen, the female tends to look slightly anemic because estrogen slows the production of red blood cells, partly by lowering body temperature and slowing thyroid function. Probably the most common cause of apparent anemia, as Broda Barnes pointed out, is hypothyroidism. He mentioned an experiment where rats—whose tailbones normally don't make red blood cells—had their tails stitched into the abdomen to keep them at core body temperature. They quickly began producing red blood cells just by raising the temperature. So, the safest way to treat anemia might be to wear long wool socks to warm the extremities.

**Josh Rubin:** What is copper's role in regards to iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its primary role is in the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase. I think that is the reason copper is essential for constructing the hemoglobin molecule.

**Josh Rubin:** So you feel that most people actually have higher amounts of iron stored in the liver and bone marrow, which is toxic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In men, it accumulates continuously with aging. Menstruation probably helps women avoid the accumulation until they stop menstruating, and then the curve is perhaps even steeper than men's. I think menstruation is one of the factors that makes women have greater longevity.

There was a study of immigrant fruit pickers' children in California. They didn't get a "good" diet, but they ate lots of oranges. They had an average hemoglobin of 10—which is considered tending towards anemia—but they didn't get infectious diseases like the well-fed city kids who had high hemoglobin. They've seen the same thing in Africa; when they campaigned to give iron supplements, malaria rates spiked because iron activates the growth of germs and weakens the immune system.

One meaningful blood test is iron saturation. People tend to be resistant to cancer development if the saturation is somewhat low, around 25%.

## ADD, ADHD, and Hashimoto’s

**Caller (Chris):** Regarding ADD and ADHD, we've seen a rise in diagnoses. Do you feel sugar is the problem, or is it polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the unsaturated fats. Sugar tends to move everything in the right direction, away from brain malfunction. Polyunsaturated fats interfere with attention and increase adrenaline, the sympathetic nervous system, and stress hormones. That, along with hypothyroidism, keeps the front part of the brain from getting enough energy to focus.

**Caller (Chris):** Regarding Hashimoto's disease, can you explain the proper way for it to be diagnosed? I realize the anti-thyroid antibodies found in blood sometimes don't have any relation to the thyroid gland.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those antibodies interact with the cartilage of the joints just about as well as with the thyroid. It's really a connective tissue inflammatory disease which goes with hypothyroidism. The cartilage is one of the first places you see hypothyroidism in children; it accounts for why hypothyroid kids tend to be knock-kneed. The cartilage in the knees and elbows is basically swollen.

**Josh Rubin:** So people are being misdiagnosed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The whole idea of autoimmune disease is off the mark. I think of the immune system as a clean-up system. The antibodies help the phagocytes remove debris. If the debris is caused by low thyroid causing the connective tissue to swell, the immune system has to come in and try to clean out the junk.

## Body Temperature and Stress Reserves

**Caller:** How long would it take for someone with a low body temperature (mid-97s) to stabilize if they institute your recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen a couple of people do it in three or four days. Very skinny people who had been on a pure soy/tofu diet—as soon as they started eating eggs and oranges, they popped right up.

**Caller:** I read Hans Selye's work. He seems to believe we have an absolute reserve of energy to deal with stress and that any stressful event depletes this. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think where he left it is where the issue of the cumulative buildup of iron and PUFA comes in. Both long-chain polyunsaturated fats and iron accumulate with aging, stress, and under the influence of estrogen. Selye wasn't looking far enough to see how those factors interacted with stress.

During prolonged adaptation, estrogen, growth hormone, and inflammatory mediators accumulate. Estrogen buildup blocks thyroid function and begins to directly drive the adrenal gland. When that reaches a certain point, you can get bleeding in the adrenal gland and death of the cortical cells just from an excess of estrogen. The systemic effect of stress is what he neglected to think about when he talked about the innate reserve of energy.

## Inflammation and Healing

**Josh Rubin:** In a 2006 newsletter, you discussed Metchnikoff and argued that inflammation was a pathological reaction rather than a healthy part of a defensive immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Metchnikoff saw the white blood cells going in and curing the problem—clearing up the mess. But after the medical establishment took it over, they created the idea of inflammation—the swelling, redness, and pain—as the curative process. I think these are pathological.

The immune system should work like it does in the prenatal state. In the embryonic and fetal state, injury is corrected without inflammation. The cells just repair the damage efficiently and don't leave a scar. When you keep carbon dioxide and sugar where they should be, you basically get fetal or embryonic healing without a scar and without inflammation. I see inflammation as an inability to deliver what's needed to repair the damage.

## Weight Gain vs. Muscle Growth

**Josh Rubin:** I have questions about weight loss. People follow your philosophies, notice their energy goes up, but they gain weight. Can you elaborate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gaining weight probably isn't the issue; it's gaining inches and bulging. When you're doing everything right, very likely you will rebuild muscles that were damaged by stress and poor nutrition. As those muscles grow, the circumference of your thighs, hips, and belly should be decreasing even though your weight is increasing.

When I first experimented with DHEA, I noticed after a week or two that my waist seemed to be reappearing. My pants were getting looser, but I was exactly the same weight. I was simply growing more lean tissue and burning up fat. However, if someone is putting on fat—their pants are getting too tight—they are just eating too much, probably too much fat or total calories. I've mentioned averaging a gallon of milk a day at times, but that was always 1% milk.

## Aromatase Inhibitors

**Josh Rubin:** What are your feelings on aromatase inhibitors like calcium D-glucarate or DIM?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically, they're usually selling powdered cabbage leaves. That has been tested and found to be somewhat estrogenic in itself.

Saturated fats antagonize the estrogen-aromatase activating effect of PUFA. Aspirin, by blocking prostaglandins and reducing inflammation, interrupts the effect of PUFA. Aspirin is a very effective aromatase inhibitor, but drug companies don't want people to know that because aspirin costs a penny. Thyroid also inhibits aromatase, as does anything that lowers cortisol.

## Coffee and "Adrenal Fatigue"

**Josh Rubin:** Many people say coffee causes adrenal fatigue. You have the opposite view. Can you elaborate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been trying to find out who started the idea of "adrenal fatigue." Coffee contains magnesium, niacin, and B vitamins. The caffeine has an antioxidant effect. As long as you use it with food, it tends to stabilize blood sugar and reduce inflammation.

Regarding adrenal fatigue: Hans Selye took out animals' adrenal glands. If they were pregnant, they had no symptoms until they gave birth because progesterone alone covers the spectrum of adrenal hormones. With adequate Vitamin A and thyroid, you will convert cholesterol into pregnenolone and progesterone. The adrenals are also very good at repairing themselves.

**Josh Rubin:** How should people use coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Taking it with or after a meal has basically none of the harmful effects. I've known people who felt shattered by a sip of coffee, but when they put heavy cream and sugar in it and took it with a meal, within three or four days they were happy coffee drinkers.

## Fructose and Fatty Liver

**Josh Rubin:** There is a lot of controversy claiming fructose causes diabetes and fatty liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a few days ago, I heard from someone in New Zealand diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. He started a diet that included 300 grams of fructose every day. He now has a new diagnosis: his liver has no fat problem.

The fructose phobia evolved over the last 50 or 60 years and is closely connected to the cholesterol doctrine of heart disease and the idea of essential fatty acids. The actual science showed that the so-called essential fatty acids are toxic and carcinogenic.

## Pork Fat Saturation

**Josh Rubin:** You’ve mentioned that pigs fed soy have unsaturated fat. A listener asks: if their fat is unsaturated, why is bacon solid at room temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you extract the fat, it isn't solid. When I was a kid, lard was solid like butter. The lard I've seen in recent years, which is now over 30% PUFA, is soft at room temperature. The fat droplets in bacon are enclosed in cells and connected by connective tissue, so even if it was 100% PUFA, it would still have a white, firm appearance due to the structure.

## Thyroid Medication: Time Release vs. Cytomel

**Josh Rubin:** Is time-released T3 better than basic Cytomel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard from people having either overdose effects or no effects from time-release. A lawyer sent me documents where they analyzed compounded time-release T3 and found *no* T3 in it. If compounded carelessly, T3 is easily destroyed. The wrong time-release agent might permanently bind the T3 or release it all at once. There hasn't been good research on how to compound time-release T3. Generally, I don't think patented brand-name medicine is a good idea, but in the case of T3, I haven't seen a good alternative to Cytomel.

## The Raw Carrot

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend eating the carrot before, with, or after a meal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually just eating the carrot is fine. If you have low blood sugar or thyroid issues, eating it with a meal might slow digestion too much, making you feel shaky. However, if a person wants to reduce fat absorption, eating the carrot *with* the meal will accelerate weight loss.

**Josh Rubin:** Can it cause constipation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very rarely. If the intestine has been sluggish, stimulating it with the raw carrot changes the rhythm of peristalsis. It sometimes takes a week to set up a new rhythm.

## Carbon Dioxide

**Josh Rubin:** Does adding baking soda to orange juice help increase carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you put it in acid (like juice), the baking soda will bubble off most of the carbon dioxide. Some will dissolve, and it might increase systemic CO2 a little. Experiments with bicycle racers showed that taking baking soda improved performance, either due to the sodium or the CO2.

## Gallbladder and Fat Digestion

**Josh Rubin:** If someone doesn't have a gallbladder, is coconut oil the best fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just eating things in a mixed form in small amounts is important. If you don't have a gallbladder, the bile is still there, but it comes out in dribbles rather than surges.

## PUFA Detox

**Josh Rubin:** A listener feels they are having hypoglycemic reactions since starting your recommendations. Is this due to PUFA detox?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping blood sugar steady and adding saturated fat helps. Saturated fats inhibit stress hormones and the release of fat from stores. Sugar, saturated fats, niacin, and aspirin all inhibit the release of fat. You want to keep the stored fat in place while the body slowly oxidizes it.

**Josh Rubin:** What about supplements like niacinamide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Niacinamide is an anti-fat liberating substance. Usually, 100mg twice a day is all it takes.

One safe way the body eliminates stored PUFA is through the liver. The liver recognizes PUFA as toxins and will selectively attach glucuronic acid to them—just as if it were dioxin—and send them to the kidneys for excretion.

## Blood Pressure, Salt, and Albumin

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about the benefits of salt, especially regarding pregnancy and eclampsia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eclampsia is closely connected to high PUFA, low thyroid, low carbon dioxide, and poor ability to retain sodium. Sodium is constantly lost, as is magnesium. As sodium is lost, the adrenals increase aldosterone to retain sodium, but at the expense of losing magnesium faster.

If you increase sodium intake, you compensate for low thyroid function and turn off the aldosterone. Lowering aldosterone reduces inflammation and stops magnesium loss. Tom Brewer showed that sodium alone would commonly cure the problem.

**Josh Rubin:** How does albumin play into this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen interferes with the liver's synthesis of albumin. Under stress, PUFAs circulate, and albumin picks them up. If albumin is loaded with fats, it passes through the kidneys into the urine. Albumin's function is to retain water in the blood. If sodium is low, albumin can't work. If albumin is low, you get water retention issues. Correcting fats, thyroid, and estrogen lets water out of the body while retaining sodium and magnesium.

## Heavy Metal Detox

**Caller:** What do you think of heavy metal detox, like IV glutathione or Vitamin C drips, after removing amalgams?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hans Selye showed that mercury plus Vitamin C prevented toxic effects in animals. Mercury in its reduced form isn't toxic; it depends on the state of reduction. Caffeine is associated with getting heavy metals out of tissues. Vitamin C from food is an important defense.

However, taking reducing agents like glutathione in an unphysiological way (IV) can activate iron and increase free radical damage. I don't think IV drips are necessary.

## Carrot Preparation

**Caller (Debbie):** Is there an advantage to shredding the carrot versus eating it whole?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments on milling bran showed that the length of the fiber matters. Putting a carrot in a blender destroys the water-retaining function of the fibers. Chewing it leaves large sections of fiber intact, which is very good.

## Male Fertility

**Josh Rubin:** regarding low sperm count, what can be done?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid is probably the main cause of infertility. In the 1940s, they saw that pregnenolone alone greatly increased sperm quality. Polyunsaturated fats interfere with steroid production and thyroid function. I've seen couples get pregnant in just a few weeks after the man used pregnenolone and thyroid.

## Sleep Issues

**Josh Rubin:** Some people following your principles have trouble sleeping or wake up with a high pulse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Taking too much thyroid too soon can do that. The liver needs to regenerate its ability to store glycogen to fast through the night. Before that happens, thyroid makes your body demand more sugar. You have to eat more often. Having fat with your carbohydrate at bedtime makes it absorb more slowly. Salt is also very effective at lowering adrenaline to help sleep.

## Fructose vs. Starch

**Caller:** I felt great on pure fructose but developed sleep problems. I switched to starch; my sleep normalized, but my digestion got worse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starch is digested and assimilated more slowly. Eating fiber and fat with your carbohydrate will extend the absorption. Pure sugar is absorbed quickly; starch, if slow to break down, can feed bacteria lower in the intestine and cause inflammation. The combination of fat and fiber might be a way to make your blood sugar steadier without the digestive issues of starch.

## Dental Health

**Josh Rubin:** There is conflicting info on sugar and dental health.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A recent article on dental health in Sweden showed that while cavities decreased, sugar and candy consumption had actually increased. Old studies showed that increased estrogen increased dental decay, while increased thyroid reduced it. Stress will quickly cause an outbreak of cavities. Mainline dentistry ignores the chemical and immunological function of saliva, which is a mediator of stress.

## Fasting and Autophagy

**Josh Rubin:** What about protein restriction and fasting to induce autophagy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Activating your metabolism will eat up proteins that shouldn't be there. Fasting drops carbohydrate intake, which raises cortisol. Cortisol breaks down proteins to turn them into sugar. You are running on stress.

## Cell Phones

**Josh Rubin:** Are cell phones really unhealthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Microwaves are a threat. There have been experiments for over 50 years showing biological effects from weak fields. The medical doctrine relies on the "cell membrane" theory—that a cell is a bag of water needing a barrier. They assume radiation must heat the cell to damage it. But the cell is highly organized, and regions have antenna-like functions that respond to low levels of electromagnetic energy.

## Thyroid Glandulars

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend thyroid glandulars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If cholesterol is low (around 100), you must be careful increasing metabolic rate. Get cholesterol up first. Then, thyroid will help. Traditional diets included the thyroid gland (fish head soup), which had a ratio of about 3:1 or 4:1 (T4 to T3).

The liver converts T4 to T3 if it has enough glucose. Glandulars are safer because they let the liver handle the conversion. However, the manufacturing of glandulars has changed. Armour was bought by Revlon, and they began extracting calcitonin, changing the product.

## Magnesium and Calcium

**Josh Rubin:** What is the optimal ratio of calcium to magnesium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can't talk about the ideal ratio in the abstract. Thyroid status determines how much magnesium you need. If thyroid is low, cells can't retain magnesium.

Calcium lowers excitatory inflammatory things. William Frederick Koch found he could cure muscle spasms with calcium, potassium, sodium, or magnesium. It's a matter of having a total of these alkaline minerals. Milk has a ratio of 1.3 to 1 (calcium to phosphorus), which is very safe. Fructose helps you lose excess phosphate, supporting the parathyroid.

## Vitamin E Changes

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wanted to comment on Vitamin E. When ADM bought the old distillation factories, they changed the methods. The old Vitamin E (from the 1930s-50s) was rich in long-chain saturated alcohols like octacosanol and policosanol. These have endurance effects and likely contributed to the original beneficial research on Vitamin E. Modern Vitamin E lacks these.

## Polio and Immunity

**Caller (Justin):** I read in your book about Mexican children not getting polio.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect the Mexican immigrants were immune to many infectious diseases because of their relative iron deficiency. Also, traditional tortillas are very high in calcium because they are boiled in lime. That high calcium intake has a strong anti-stress effect.

## Cell Membrane Theory

**Josh Rubin:** What do you feel about research regarding cell membrane signaling?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's good business, but the "membrane" isn't relevant to actual cell physiology. Experiments 80 years ago showed large molecules like albumin zipping in and out of cells freely. The work of Fritjof Sjöstrand, a professor at UCLA, showed that the conventional ideas about plasma membranes are incompatible with the actual structure of the cell.

## Conclusion
