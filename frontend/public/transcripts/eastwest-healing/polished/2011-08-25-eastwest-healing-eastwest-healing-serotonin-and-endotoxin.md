## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** What up everyone? This is Josh Rubin and Jeannie Rubin of Holistic Living. We're here today to share our radio show with Dr. Raymond Peat. Today's show is on serotonin and endotoxin distress. Ray Peat is a teacher, educator, and researcher, and today he is going to school us on these topics. How are you doing, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Josh Rubin:** How are you doing, Jeannie?

**Jeannie Rubin:** I'm doing great, Josh. Thanks.

**Josh Rubin:** Before we start, Ray, did you want to announce anything or add anything to your intro before we start talking about serotonin and endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not really. I've just been finishing another newsletter that includes stuff on serotonin. This one is on osteoporosis, and serotonin turns out to be a major factor in causing that and other aging degenerative changes.

## The Role of Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** I've gotten a lot of requests to talk about serotonin. A lot of people don't know what endotoxin is, but you correlate it with serotonin in the gut. Most people understand serotonin as a brain chemical. Is it a hormone? Where does it come from? Why is there so much focus on serotonin in your research?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can't understand the other things that I'm working on unless you know where serotonin fits in. For example, estrogen does a lot of its work by way of serotonin. To understand unsaturated fatty acids versus saturated, you have to understand estrogen and serotonin. To understand thyroid, you have to understand all of those.

It is one of the emergency defense systems. You can't begin to understand stress or compensating for stress without seeing where serotonin fits in. Hans Selye was one of the early researchers on the biological effects of serotonin, and Aldous Huxley was another person that got me interested in its variety of effects.

**Josh Rubin:** Most Western research refers to serotonin as a brain chemical. Where do you find most of the serotonin in the body, where is it produced, and what are its main functions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Roughly 95% of it is produced in the intestine. The biggest concentration in the digestive system is in or around the appendix.

Part of how I got interested in the pattern of thyroid, estrogen, and serotonin was when I was about nine years old, I started becoming nearsighted and occasionally had migraine headaches. I noticed that things I ate would tend to bring on the headaches. I saw that nearsightedness was much more common among girls, especially starting around puberty, and several of the nearsighted girls I knew had migraines.

I started thinking about what I had in common with girls in puberty, and it was the thyroid question. Estrogen and serotonin happen to be anti-thyroid factors. If you are borderline for thyroid function, you are very susceptible to excesses and imbalances in estrogen and serotonin.

## History of Serotonin and LSD

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ergot, a fungal disease of grains, was used for thousands of years to induce abortions. In the 19th century, attempts were made to use it to accelerate labor, but it was dangerous. It causes spasms not only in the uterus but in blood vessels. When people were poisoned by this ergot fungus, they would develop gangrene, insanity, nausea, and vomiting.

In the early 1900s, people started studying the chemistry of ergot. Histamine was the first thing they identified that caused muscular spasms. In the 1920s and 30s, continuing study of ergot turned up a dozen different categories of amines. Hoffman at Sandoz was working on this when he accidentally discovered the nervous properties of LSD.

In the 1930s, an Italian researcher identified an amine in the intestine that caused intestinal contractions. Later, an English group studying beef blood found an amine they thought caused blood vessel contraction. It turned out to be the same thing found much more abundantly in the intestine.

The English group gave it to someone to develop an assay. This person happened to have experienced Sandoz's LSD and knew about its mental effects. He found that serotonin would cause uterine contractions, and LSD would block that contraction. Serotonin would block kidney function; LSD would restore it. Since he saw a straight-across antagonism between LSD and serotonin, he proposed that the brain contains a small amount of serotonin and that LSD has its effects by antagonizing this serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** So we should all take a little dose of LSD every day to be anti-inflammatory and down-regulate serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a new interest in LSD as a protective chemical. They are finding that it prevents nerve damage caused by some of the serotonergic excitotoxic chemicals.

**Josh Rubin:** Interesting.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By 1960, people were already proposing LSD to cure or prevent migraine headaches. But then the government banned research on LSD. Someone developed the idea that since LSD was an antagonist of serotonin, and the reason for banning LSD was supposedly that it made people insane, therefore serotonin must make you sane. That reasoning spread like a plague through the national culture. That seems to be the extent of the reasoning behind the idea that serotonin is the "happy drug."

## Serotonin Production in the Gut

**Josh Rubin:** Why is most of it found in the appendix? Isn't there a lot in the small intestine as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a gradient increasing as you go down the small intestine. Normally, the upper part starting at your stomach is sterile. As you go down, the likelihood of having bacteria increases. As a person's thyroid function decreases, their intestinal secretions and peristalsis are reduced, and bacteria tend to creep farther up.

The gradient of bacterial infection increases parallel to the gradient of serotonin. The toxins from the bacteria interacting with the physiology of the person stimulate the production of serotonin. The function of serotonin is to cause contraction of the intestinal muscles to cause diarrhea and get rid of the irritant.

**Josh Rubin:** What foods encourage that bacterial growth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things that are slowest to be broken down by your own enzymes. Since we don't have enzymes for fibers such as pectin or lignans, the bacteria live on those. The less cooked a vegetable is, the better food it is for bacteria. Even firm fruits with fibrous material, like crisp apples or pears, are very good bacterial food and very poor human food.

**Josh Rubin:** Could something as simple as a blood sugar handling issue stimulate serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you have an acute blood sugar decrease, you put out a lot of adrenaline. That cuts the circulation for the fight-or-flight reaction. You stop digestive processes and don't deliver much blood to the intestine. The food sits there, letting the bacteria have a chance at it. Then, any kind of irritation will trigger the serotonin release.

## Estrogen, Cortisol, and PUFA

**Josh Rubin:** What other hormones does serotonin synthesize with? What is its correlation with estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen activates the enzyme that turns tryptophan into serotonin. It is inhibited by progesterone. The route *out* of serotonin—monoamine oxidase type A—is inhibited by estrogen, so it doesn't break down serotonin. So, the "in" route is increased by estrogen and the "out" route is decreased by estrogen.

In our lab, we saw that estrogen treatment would cause animals to enlarge their adrenal cortex, activate it, and then the adrenal cortex would start bleeding and dying. The mechanism is that stress increases serotonin; serotonin increases the release factor that drives the pituitary hormone, which drives the adrenal cortex. So stress, acting through estrogen or serotonin, ends up overworking your adrenal cortex.

**Josh Rubin:** This is dangerous because a lot of women are on SSRIs and synthetic estrogens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's where the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) come in too. They are specifically effective at releasing tryptophan to enter the brain or other cells to produce more serotonin. The serotonin activates the enzymes that convert PUFA into prostaglandins, which are executors of the inflammatory process.

**Josh Rubin:** So the unsaturated fats increase brain uptake of L-tryptophan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Josh Rubin:** Is that why Western research shows serotonin as a brain chemical?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That orientation comes exclusively from the drug industry. They don't want people noticing the diseases that would be cured or prevented if people understood what tryptophan, serotonin, estrogen, and polyunsaturated fats are doing.

## SSRIs and Measurement Issues

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of people taking SSRIs think they are helping themselves because they have "low serotonin." You're saying there is actually an excess.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Instead of measuring the amount of serotonin in the serum, they measure the breakdown product in the urine. If your lungs are working effectively to destroy serotonin, you'll see the breakdown product. If the lungs aren't working effectively, you won't see the breakdown product. So it looks like you might not be experiencing serotonin stimulation when that's exactly why you *are* experiencing it—because you aren't forming the breakdown product.

Men with more than 100 nanograms per milliliter of serotonin in their blood serum tend to be imperfectly fertile or impotent. I would infer that everyone who has more than 25 nanograms per milliliter is experiencing some sort of inflammatory, degenerative process.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on the correlation between melatonin and serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An Italian researcher has seen melatonin closely associated with rheumatoid arthritis. High melatonin goes with high rheumatoid symptoms. I interpret that not to mean that melatonin is causing the inflammation, but that serotonin is turned into melatonin as a detoxifying process when stressed.

**Josh Rubin:** So people supplementing with melatonin or 5-HTP might be making it worse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you take 10 milligrams of melatonin, that's going to be a problem. But 5-HTP turns massively into serotonin. That's where people are going to get the problem. That is much more dangerous than melatonin.

**Josh Rubin:** What about people taking 5-HTP for mood who feel it helps?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it happens to drive up their cortisol, cortisol makes everyone feel good temporarily by stopping inflammation. They have treated aggressive dogs with SSRIs and found that they work to decrease aggressive viciousness. At the time the dogs become friendly, they measure the serotonin in the blood and find that it has *decreased* greatly.

## Thyroid, CO2, and Hyperventilation

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about serotonin's correlation with the thyroid and CO2 levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you are low in thyroid, your serotonin goes up. The TSH is partly increased by the rising serotonin. Low thyroid people very often have increased prolactin as well.

The absence of carbon dioxide is a place where you can start. If you hyperventilate for a minute, the loss of CO2 in your blood raises the pH in the blood platelets. The loss of carbon dioxide causes the platelets to spill their serotonin, causing blood capillaries to dilate and become leaky. Within a minute, you can create a hyper-serotonemic, edematous condition.

**Josh Rubin:** So people diagnosed with asthma might actually just be hyperventilating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Women taking estrogen will tend to hyperventilate and have a slightly alkalotic condition. That increases the release of serotonin and histamine, causing contraction of the muscles in the breathing system.

## Light and Darkness

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about what light or darkness has to do with serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The peak serotonin in the blood is at midnight in the winter. The enzymes that produce it and detoxify it are under the influence of light. People get sick, tend to have strokes, and depression is exacerbated under the influence of darkness and high serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** So light is more stimulatory to progesterone, and darkness is more stimulatory towards estrogen and serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's the increased day length in the spring that makes animals fertile from rising progesterone.

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked about serotonin and exercise. Popular articles say aerobic exercise is good because it raises serotonin. What is the best kind of exercise to make sure excess serotonin is not produced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Resistance exercise of a very moderate sort—muscle building—is best for lowering inflammation and serotonin. You want to stay below the lactate threshold.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend anything nutritionally during a workout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugars. Keeping your cell energy up and producing carbon dioxide is the best way to minimize the serotonin. Orange juice.

## Endotoxin

**Josh Rubin:** Let's move on to endotoxin. What is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its technical name is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is some fatty acids attached to a short starch-like molecule. It's made by a variety of bacteria, specifically the gram-negative type. Animals have evolved to recognize the presence of lipopolysaccharide as the presence of bacteria. It activates the innate immune system.

It seems to have a soaping type of action on cells that destabilizes them. That physical irritation is enough to activate the production of serotonin, release of histamine, and nitric oxide. We normally can destroy all of it that gets into the bloodstream by the time it gets to the liver. But if your liver is overworked or under-energized, the endotoxin gets through into your bloodstream.

**Josh Rubin:** So something as simple as the stress reaction could cause an increased production of endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Increased absorption of it, yes. A lot of starchy food, undercooked cereals, and poorly cooked vegetable material will feed the bacteria and increase their production of it.

**Josh Rubin:** What foods protect against it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium happens to suppress the fermentation of fiber and starch in the intestine. High calcium intake will reduce the production of endotoxin. Saturated fats also help; fatty acids have a germicidal effect that helps keep the intestine sterile.

**Josh Rubin:** What are the best sources of calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Powdered eggshells are by far the next best to milk and cheese. Calcium carbonate from eggshell is very pure.

## The Raw Carrot and Keto Acids

**Josh Rubin:** Can you explain why you recommend a raw carrot versus a cooked carrot?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cooking makes the carrot fiber acceptable to bacteria, and bacteria will thrive on cooked carrots. Almost no microorganism can multiply on a raw carrot. The point of the carrot isn't nutrition; it's to help cleanse your intestine.

**Josh Rubin:** What about keto proteins? You mention them in your articles.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** These are keto acids. They are the equivalent carbon framework of the essential amino acids, but they lack the ammonia needed to make the complete amino acid. Potatoes happen to be very rich in these. If you juice a potato, you get these keto acids. When you eat it, they change into essential amino acids in your bloodstream by absorbing ammonia. This allows you to recycle ammonia instead of making it into urea that needs to be excreted.

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked about a correlation between raised moles and unsaturated fat or serotonin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've had a lot of experience with the effect of thyroid on moles. Every time I have become hypothyroid, I notice I get moles growing. Adjusting the thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA causes them to disappear in a matter of hours or days.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about anemia in correlation with the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes believed that hypothyroidism was usually the cause of anemia. It's simply a matter of temperature. If your extremities are cold, the bones are too cold to make blood cells.

## Candida and Yeast

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked about Candida or yeast overgrowth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Candida normally is harmless in the intestine. Low thyroid people sometimes have Candida growing even in their stomachs. If you want to make a yeast angry, don't feed it sugar. When it is deficient in sugar, it will drill holes in your intestine to find glucose in the blood. If you keep feeding the yeast sugar, the worst you will get is a little drunk. The raw carrot is a very good antiseptic for Candida.

**Josh Rubin:** What about bamboo shoots?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I like them cooked with cheese or egg. They are also helpful.

## Pregnancy, Aspirin, and Fibrosis

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ergot derivatives and serotonin are involved in impaired fertility, birth defects, and difficult delivery. The whole preeclampsia syndrome is centered on high serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** What about vitamin E and aspirin? You talk about aspirin increasing circulation in the uterus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspirin is very powerful against serotonin in many of the ways that thyroid works. Aspirin, thyroid, and fructose work in the same ways against serotonin. In an animal model of pulmonary artery hypertension, they can cure it just with aspirin.

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked about niacinamide. Have you ever seen it cause GI upset?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The nicotinic acid form—the kind that makes people turn red—increases the release of serotonin and histamine. Even the "no flush" niacin releases nicotinic acid. Niacinamide doesn't do that.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on fibrosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hans Selye demonstrated that serotonin would calcify the skin. It increases the parathyroid hormone, which takes calcium out of your bones and puts it in your blood vessels and kidneys. Eating excess calcium is helpful for regulating the parathyroid hormone.

**Josh Rubin:** What about salt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I use Morton's canning and pickling salt because it has no additives. The red color in Himalayan salt is mostly iron, and where you find iron, you are likely to find heavy metals. Gray Celtic salt is basically French mud.

## Caller Questions

**Josh Rubin:** We have a caller. Justin from Tacoma.

**Justin:** I live in the Pacific Northwest where we have stressful winters with not much light. I was looking for practical applications for the use of red light.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With mercury vapor ultraviolet lights, you have to be careful not to get sunburned. I prefer to use a vitamin D supplement rather than fiddle with UV light.

For light, you can get 130-volt reflector bulbs. They are designed to run on a higher voltage, so on standard voltage, they produce an orange-colored light that is rich in the red spectrum. They are usually about 250 watts. I have two of them aimed at the area where I work. They call them infrared, which just means they are designed for a different voltage.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** We are running out of time. Anything else you want to add?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The current newsletter is going out in about a week on osteoporosis and how serotonin fits into that. The next one will be on sugars, especially fructose, because of the craziness telling people to fear fruit.

**Josh Rubin:** It is pretty crazy. Just a quick question on osteoporosis: is it the correlation with parathyroid hormone and prolactin that leads to it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They noticed that people on SSRIs were getting exaggerated degrees of osteoporosis. One group researching this said they "rediscovered whole animal physiology" when they realized the intestine was the source of the serotonin causing the osteoporosis.

**Josh Rubin:** One last thing regarding mood. You mentioned the dog study.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things that lower your serotonin are likely to make you less aggressive but happier. The behavioral system for harm avoidance and inhibition is what serotonin is doing. When you reduce your overproduction of serotonin, you stop thinking about harm avoidance and have a more positive, constructive, exploratory attitude.

**Josh Rubin:** So the lower the better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the lower the better.

**Josh Rubin:** Great show. Thanks for coming on, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye.
