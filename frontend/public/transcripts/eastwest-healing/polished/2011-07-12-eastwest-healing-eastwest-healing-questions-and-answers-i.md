## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome back to a great show with Ray Peat. Today we are going to do a question and answer session. Jeannie is not going to be on the call today, so it will just be me.

Ray has a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at many schools, from the University of Oregon to Montana State University, as well as naturopathic schools in Mexico. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968. You can look at his website at RayPeat.com to learn more about his background and read his articles.

Ray, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Josh Rubin:** The first question everyone keeps emailing me is: do you have a timeline for when you are going to start taking new subscribers to the newsletter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think we changed that notice and they are available now.

## Probiotics and Gut Health

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of people are gung-ho about probiotics. If people have gas or anything wrong, they take probiotics. You don't talk too much about them. Can you elaborate on your thoughts regarding the pros and cons of taking them? Specifically, are you thinking about lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, or a combination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are probably okay to try. One thing that has made me skeptical about them was an article published in *Nature* probably 35 or 40 years ago. It showed that there are antigenic regions on these lactobacilli that exactly match proteins associated with female reproductive action. From puberty to menopause, roughly, there is the risk of having an autoimmune or immunological interaction between intestinal bacteria and body tissues. There hasn't been much follow-up on that, but that is the period when autoimmune-type problems show up in women. Estrogen is probably the main factor involved in that, but it just happens that there is this antigen parallel between the bacteria and the person.

The bacteria do have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the membranes of the intestine, but one problem is that they produce lactic acid. If you provide them with enough fuel, they can produce lactic acid, which is a potential toxin. It stimulates inflammation and the formation of fibrosis or collagen.

**Josh Rubin:** I think the biggest thing for everyone to understand is that Lactobacillus is lactate-producing. If you take it and don't need it, you might be causing more of a problem.

## Fasting and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** From a health perspective, is there any time you would recommend fasting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies in which rheumatoid arthritis and similar conditions are completely relieved during a week-long fast, but they come back as soon as the person eats again. That is partly because cortisol increases tremendously when you aren't eating. The cortisol converts muscle tissue into fuel to live on, and at the same time, it has an anti-inflammatory effect.

However, the bowel is really the basic cause of most degenerative inflammatory diseases. So, there is a good reason for thinking fasting is therapeutic. I've seen animals with huge tumors that refused to eat, and if their owners let them sit around not eating, they would recover and live for years. The lack of appetite during sickness is a natural opportunity to fast.

Since the bowel is connected to inflammatory diseases—via bacteria producing lactic acid and endotoxin—the intestine itself produces a tremendous amount of serotonin. If serotonin isn't detoxified right away, it promotes fibrosis, inflammation, and cell multiplication in blood vessels, thickening them and promoting tumor growth.

If you can lighten the inflammation load in the intestine, you can achieve the same thing as fasting while still absorbing nutrients. You must do it in a way that doesn't produce endotoxin, lactic acid, or serotonin excess. This means using a very easily digested diet, avoiding undercooked vegetable matter that feeds bacteria, and having antimicrobial foods like raw carrots or boiled bamboo shoots.

## Evolutionary Diets and Brain Metabolism

**Caller:** It is popular to approach eating based on what we evolved to eat, like the Blood Type Diet or Paleo. What do you think about this approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That whole approach assumes that we really know what the species ate while evolving. There are a lot of fantasy theories; whatever people enjoy eating, they tend to read into history. No one is really sure. I am inclined to think that fruit eating was a good candidate for supporting evolution to be more human than ape-like, supporting a big brain and the kind of digestive system we have.

**Caller:** I've noticed that people who are cerebral or creative seem to have a lower tolerance for stress, especially if they are exercising heavily or doing low-carb diets. Do people who place high mental demands on themselves have different nutritional needs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some have commented that the brain of the average person might weigh 2% of their body weight but uses 40% or 50% of their metabolic energy. If a person has a bigger than average brain—and human brains vary tremendously in size and metabolic requirements—and they spend a great amount of mental energy, that makes a tremendous metabolic difference.

## Exercise and Thyroid Function

**Caller:** It is popular to recommend high-intensity interval training or heavy weightlifting to induce a lactate threshold. Are there ways to attenuate the ill effects of that exercise?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was an experiment 30 years ago where people walked on a treadmill without letting their heart rate go over 120 beats per minute. They measured active thyroid hormone (T3) at the beginning and after 40 minutes. The average person's T3 had gone to zero in just 40 minutes of moderate exercise.

Normally, as soon as you have some sugar, your T3 would snap right back. But the longer the stress, and the more inhibitors present (like polyunsaturated fats or bad bacteria), the more delayed the recovery of the liver and T3 production will be. With some people, a little extra stress sticks them down in that low T3 condition. Studies showed that giving a low-thyroid group a tentative dose of a thyroid supplement for two or three days helped them snap back, and their own gland would take over.

**Caller:** Finally, what is your favorite joke? Or barring that, what did you eat yesterday?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What I ate yesterday would be easier than remembering a joke. I had steak—it happened to be rib steak day—eggs, lots of milk and coffee, orange juice, and Coke.

## Schizophrenia and Hypothyroidism

**Caller:** I want to know your thoughts on the connection between schizophrenia and hypothyroidism, as well as nutritional deficiencies like niacin and copper. Also, how much does gluten intolerance have to do with it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since the intestine is involved in everything, gluten is one of the basic things that will cause problems once you get sensitized to it. High estrogen sensitizes the intestine and system to gluten. The transglutaminase enzyme, activated by estrogen, activates immune reactions that can cause celiac disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and is now known to be involved in cancer and brain conditions, including schizophrenia.

Stopping the inflammatory process is basic. I think that was behind the orthomolecular approach to treating schizophrenia. The niacin approach was working on protecting cells energetically against inflammation. Niacin inhibits the release of free fatty acids from tissue stores, and free fatty acids poison our energy apparatus. Schizophrenics are almost always heavy smokers; nicotine has a brain-protective effect against degenerative inflammatory diseases, likely overlapping with niacin pathways.

Keeping thyroid function up supports energy, and keeping toxins down—avoiding polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) and intestinal irritants like gluten—will help.

**Caller:** Would you say hypothyroidism would be the greatest factor in schizophrenia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I would guess so. Puberty is a major time for schizophrenia onset, and that is when rising hormones often interfere with thyroid function.

## Coconut Sugar and Parasites

**Caller:** Is coconut sugar from the coconut tree okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it is extracted from the sap, it is likely fine. If it is made from the starch chemically, I would want to know the process. Generally, if it starts with a natural sugar extract, it is fine.

**Caller:** What about parasite overgrowth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 100 years ago, it was common to use a spoonful of flowers of sulfur maybe once a year. A huge dose like that will clean out parasites. I've experimented with very small amounts of flowers of sulfur; a pinch a day for two or three days has a fungicidal effect and can discourage amoebas and worms. It is very safe for people in small amounts. Some organisms have exoenzymes that act on the sulfur, oxidizing it to sulfuric acid, and the pH change eliminates them.

**Caller:** Is it possible that parasites contribute to autoimmune functions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people think they have a beneficial effect, advocating catching worms to prevent autoimmune disease. I'm not convinced. I am on the Metchnikoff side, seeing cells as the central activity and immunity as a developmental process rather than specific chemotherapy against the environment. Every time we affect our developmental system, we take our whole self in a different direction. In Africa, for example, a lot of so-called AIDS is really just from being exposed to too many stimulants of the immune system.

## Sweating and Metabolism

**Josh Rubin:** What could it mean if someone is sweating all the time, even from an early age?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes it is a developmental overbalance of the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous system. Sometimes hypothyroid people compensate with extremely high adrenaline production, causing sweating even when they are not hot.

## Parasites and Thyroid Connection

**Caller:** I believe I picked up parasites in 2006 swimming in a river. I had symptoms similar to low thyroid and tested positive for Hashimoto's. Four years later, I passed a two-foot tapeworm. I'm still having digestion and energy problems. What tests should I run?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are doctors who specialize in parasites, especially in coastal tropical areas.

**Josh Rubin:** I recommend the GIFX test from Metametrix.

**Caller:** Any advice on restoring digestive function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Diet to keep your metabolic rate up, and thyroid supplement if necessary. If your metabolic rate is low, you tend to get fungal infections and parasites because the IgA antibodies on membranes are deficient in low-thyroid people.

## Fungal Infections and Sugar

**Josh Rubin:** There is a lot of hype about fungal infections. Doug Kaufmann promotes the fungal diet, saying mycotoxins feed on sugar, so you should cut sugar. You have a different view.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was a case of a Japanese man who got drunk when he ate sugar because yeast in his stomach fermented it. However, getting drunk is the only major harm there. The real problem is poor digestion from being low thyroid. Taking thyroid would likely activate digestive enzymes and eliminate the yeast.

Rene Dubos did experiments showing that when yeast in the intestine is starved for sugar, it sends out pseudo-hyphae filaments to reach through the intestine wall to get sugar from the bloodstream. They become invasive when starved. If you feed them sugar, they don't put out those invasive filaments. A sugarless diet is dangerous if you have a yeast problem. Avoiding sugar also risks depriving the liver of sugar needed to activate thyroid hormone. Fungus loves unsaturated fat but can be killed by saturated fats.

## Liver Cleansing and Detox

**Caller:** What is your feeling on liver flushes and general cleansing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments on cattle showed that while 30-35% had toxins in muscle and fat, only 6-7% had toxins in the liver. The liver has the equipment for excreting toxins. If you slow down the liver's activity—which happens in a fast—your brain and organs are exposed to chemicals diffusing out of fat and muscles. The best cleansing diet is one that increases your liver's action. Tasty food, sugar, and thyroid activate the liver.

**Caller:** When you say sugar, do you mean any kind?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Manufactured sugars like high fructose corn syrup often contain other substances intermediate between sugar and starch that can be harmful. White sugar is safe regarding allergens, but nutritionally, fruit is the best way to get sugar because it comes with minerals like potassium and magnesium.

## Edema and Salt

**Caller:** What about swollen feet in a relatively young person?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is likely from excess permeability of blood vessels; water leaks into tissues. Sometimes all it takes is eating enough salt to make your albumin function to bind water and keep it in the blood vessels. People on low-salt diets are susceptible to this. In pregnancy, high estrogen and low thyroid make blood vessels permeable. Studies showed that giving pregnant women with toxemia extra salt cured their symptoms.

## Fructose and Metabolism

**Josh Rubin:** There is bad hype about fructose being turned into fat. Why do you recommend tropical fruits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ideal amount of fructose seems to be maybe a third as much as glucose. Fructose raises the metabolic rate, increases carbon dioxide production, and catalyzes the ability to burn glucose. Experiments comparing sugar/Coke to starch showed that sugar improved calcium assimilation, increased metabolic rate, and decreased obesity.

The calcium-sparing effect of sucrose or fructose comes from the metabolic stimulation imitating active thyroid hormone, which produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide keeps calcium out of the soft tissues and puts it in the bones. This reduces the need for Vitamin D.

## Tryptophan and Meat

**Caller:** You've written that tryptophan converts to niacin if a person is healthy. Can a healthy person tolerate more muscle meat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The high phosphorus content in meat is important. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus should be high. Meat and whole grains are major sources of phosphate. Tryptophan can be handled if you have a good diet, but estrogen decreases the production of niacin from tryptophan and sends it down the serotonin pathway.

**Caller:** Is that why you recommend milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because of the high calcium-to-phosphate ratio.

## Spices and Garlic

**Caller:** Are there spices you don't recommend? My girlfriend craves garlic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main problem with onion and garlic is if you are allergic to them. Low thyroid people often have symptoms like gallbladder spasms when they eat them, especially if cooked. But as foods, they are fine if tolerated. Many spices are allergens.

## Thyroid Dosing (Cytomel/T3)

**Caller:** Can you elaborate on the proper way to take Cytomel (T3)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are in a temporary stress state, sometimes 10 micrograms will break the stress. If you need it longer, the body normally makes 4 or 5 micrograms of T3 per hour. If you take more than 10 micrograms at once, your liver activates enzymes to destroy it.

If you take 10 micrograms with a meal, the food delays absorption, so you get maybe 2 or 3 micrograms per hour. Taking 10mcg with each meal is a smooth way to take it.

**Caller:** Does it have to be taken with thyroxine (T4)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just occasionally. If someone wants to lower cholesterol quickly, frequent small doses of T3 work. T4 depends on the liver for activation. In women, estrogen often keeps the liver from making enough T3 from the thyroxine.

## Raw vs. Cooked Food

**Caller:** What is your opinion on raw vs. cooked foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With animal products, cooking kills parasites and microorganisms. There is no nutritional benefit to cooking them, but safety is key. With fruit, a typical apple is likely unripened and contains pectin. Pectin isn't digestible by humans but feeds bacteria. Eating raw, unripe fruit feeds bacteria.

**Caller:** Is there nutrient loss in cooking?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. An experiment in the 1940s fed rats either canned vegetables or raw vegetables. The animals eating the canned vegetables thrived; the ones eating raw did not.

**Caller:** What about enzymes in raw food like papaya?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those enzymes are biologically active, but the production of pancreatic digestive enzymes isn't a stress; it's a natural function. I don't think there is a benefit to supplementing enzymes for the pancreas's sake.

## Low CO2 in Children

**Caller:** My four-year-old had leukemia and his CO2 levels are low (16-19). Doctors want to use bicarbonate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bicarbonate (baking soda) is very helpful. It helps regulate minerals and can bring up systemic CO2. However, the most effective thing is to check the thyroid function, which controls CO2 production. The AACE (American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists) has a TSH range of 0.3 to 3.0, but I think the ideal is toward the low end, 0.3 or 0.4.

**Caller:** He also has chronic diarrhea despite diet changes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Are his vegetables cooked? Salads cause diarrhea or constipation in many people.

## Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

**Caller:** I was diagnosed with MS eight years ago. I have recurrent fungal/yeast symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first five or six people I saw with an MS diagnosis recovered instantly when they took thyroid. A common symptom of low thyroid is pituitary enlargement (prolactin-secreting tumor), which presses on the optic nerve and causes vision loss, often misdiagnosed as brain disease. It is good to check prolactin and thyroid.

**Caller:** How can I check for bad bacteria holistically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Try eating a raw carrot every day—shredded with olive oil, vinegar, and salt. It has a germicidal action. In well-diagnosed MS, endotoxin is a factor causing blood vessels in the head to leak. Endotoxin can be drastically reduced by the raw carrot. Also, ensure you get enough protein (at least 80 grams) from milk, cheese, eggs, and shellfish.

## Diet Transition and Cholesterol

**Josh Rubin:** When starting a pro-thyroid diet, does the body go through a detox? Would you see increased cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person has low cholesterol, they shouldn't start a thyroid supplement full force because thyroid converts cholesterol into hormones. Low cholesterol must be fixed first (fruit helps).

If cholesterol rises, it usually means the liver is getting enough energy to make it. Cholesterol is a protective, adaptive substance. The Framingham study found that people over 50 with cholesterol under 200 were more likely to have dementia. Longest-lived people in nursing home studies averaged around 270 or 280 cholesterol.

## Language Learning and Coffee

**Caller:** Do you have advice for learning a second language?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin B1 and coffee can make a tremendous difference. When I learned French for my graduate exam, I did it over a weekend with plenty of coffee and a few hundred milligrams of Vitamin B1. B1 makes you produce energy faster (more CO2) and increases circulation to the brain.

**Caller:** Is coffee estrogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hops in beer are estrogenic. Coffee is a major dietary source of niacin and magnesium. It is beneficial.

## Liver and Raw Eggs

**Josh Rubin:** What is the upper limit of eating liver, and what about raw eggs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lightly cooking them reduces the risk of infection. Eating them raw doesn't protect you from the polyunsaturated fats in them. Liver should be eaten maybe once a week (six ounces).

**Josh Rubin:** Some people get bloating from gelatin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you eat it undissolved, it feeds bacteria. It must be dissolved. Regarding liver, if I eat it without enough fat and sugar, I get low blood sugar symptoms because of the high protein. I cook it in a large amount of butter or coconut oil.

## LSD and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** What do you think about the therapeutic potential of tryptamine drugs like psilocybin and LSD?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In early studies, patients reported chronic migraines disappeared after LSD sessions. Migraines were identified as an excess serotonin problem, and LSD counteracted the serotonin.

The pharmaceutical industry wanted to market antidepressants, so they created the myth that serotonin is a "happy drug" and demonized anti-serotonin hallucinogens. Actually, serotonin is the misery drug—excess produces nausea, fibrosis, dementia, etc. LSD-type drugs imitate serotonin to trigger the feedback system that turns *off* the nerves that make serotonin. They are serotonin antagonists. Research is starting up again on using these for cluster headaches and organic diseases.

## Sunscreen and Gelatin Preparation

**Caller:** Is sunscreen necessary?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some sunblocks are carcinogenic. It is best to get sunlight but avoid sunburn. Rabbits on an unsaturated fat diet got sun-damaged skin; those on saturated fats did not. Polyunsaturated fats in the skin amplify UV damage. Coconut oil, caffeine, and aspirin applied to the skin can offer protection.

**Caller:** How do you take gelatin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I make oxtail or lamb shank soup. If using powder, I mix it with sugar, heat it until clear, and add orange juice to make gummy candies. Or I use it in mousses or marshmallows. It must be fully dissolved.

**Caller:** Is wireless internet a source of radiation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Cell phones and wireless devices emit radiation that affects nerve function and likely increases brain cancer incidence. I use wired connections.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, anything new going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My recent newsletter talks about biological processes excluded from science. Luca Turin has lectures on the internet about how molecules and cells interact electronically rather than mechanically. Gerald Pollock also has lectures on the structure of water.

**Josh Rubin:** Great show. Thanks for tuning in. Check out our website at EastWestHealing.com. Thanks, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye.
