## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Hey everyone, this is Josh Rubin from East West Healing and Performance. Welcome to our Blog Talk Radio show. Today we are going to have Dr. Raymond Peat on again. He has a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon and specializes in physiology. He started most of his work studying progesterone and hormones back in 1968. Since then, he has been working on practical and theoretical aspects of hormones and the thyroid. The bottom line is the guy is a genius; his work is cutting edge, probably 80 years ahead of its time. We’re going to be talking about the thyroid today. Let's get him on the show. Ray, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm here.

**Josh Rubin:** How's it going, Ray? We really appreciate you taking time out to come on our show and educate people on your science. In a lot of your articles, you focus on the thyroid. Could you enlighten us on why you study the thyroid so much and why you feel the thyroid hormone is the most important hormone in the body?

## The Role of Thyroid in Evolution and Development

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Looking at life in general, plants, funguses, and amoebas are the organisms that apparently don't need or want thyroid. But as soon as you get what we think of as real animal life—that includes corals, coelenterates, echinoderms, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, just about everything that has an organization to it—they use thyroid.

The basic function of thyroid is to energize cells and to give them enough energy and efficiency to allow them to differentiate so that they don't just concentrate on eating and growing the way plants, amoebas, and fungi do.

If you look at some of the old experiments in an aquarium with developing frog eggs, as soon as the eggs would hatch into tadpoles, they would either add an anti-thyroid chemical or a little bit of thyroid hormone to the water. If you added the anti-thyroid chemical, the tadpole would never turn into a frog; it would just grow to be a huge tadpole. But if you added thyroid to the aquarium, the tiny hatchling tadpole would turn into a tiny, spider-like frog just about the size of a fly. This shows that the thyroid energizes the cells so that they use oxygen and produce a huge amount of energy. This energy allows the cells to realize their function. Without thyroid, all you have is growth. That's fine for amoebas and trees, but in humans, it can lead to tumors and malformations.

Energy production is really the basis of all organized life. That makes the thyroid, in a sense, the main gland. If you take out the pituitary gland—which people have talked about as the master gland—and give the animal thyroid hormone, in some cases the animals live ten times as long as normal, usually about twice as long as normal for the lack of the pituitary gland, as long as they had adequate thyroid.

**Josh Rubin:** So you're saying the thyroid is the master regulator of metabolism? It keeps your body in an efficient, anti-inflammatory state where you're producing energy more efficiently than you're expending it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. The inflammatory state means that something has gone wrong. It's interesting that doctors very often go entirely on the basis of the pituitary Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) in diagnosing your thyroid status. However, TSH creates all sorts of inflammatory processes. When you have enough actual thyroid hormone to completely shut down your pituitary, you turn off practically all of these toxic inflammatory processes.

## Diagnosing Thyroid Function: Beyond TSH

**Josh Rubin:** We see so many people in our clinic being diagnosed with hypothyroidism. What's your take on the validity of current labs, and what do you recommend when it comes to measuring thyroid function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, it was standard medical practice to have a little apparatus to allow the person to lie down, usually with an empty stomach, and breathe oxygen for two minutes. They would measure how much oxygen was used. People who had the standard symptoms of low thyroid function would often consume only half the normal amount of oxygen. That usually went with their hands and feet being cold, their core body temperature being below normal, and their heart rate being somewhat slower than normal.

As they looked at biochemical indicators, they saw that cholesterol was almost invariably high in proportion to the reduced consumption of oxygen. The increasing cholesterol was like a mirror image of the decreasing metabolic rate. If you gave a thyroid supplement to someone with excess cholesterol, it would immediately come down exactly in relation to the increasing oxygen use.

Carotene excess was another identifying feature. A doctor would look at a person's palm. A hypothyroid person typically would have cold, pale hands, but usually with orange areas where the skin was thickened in the calluses. That's because vitamin A is used directly in proportion to your metabolic rate and thyroid function. If your thyroid is low, you barely use your carotene and hardly convert it to vitamin A.

Another good indicator developed in the 1930s was the Achilles reflex relaxation speed. A person kneels on a chair so their toes hang over loosely, and you thump the Achilles tendon. In a hypothyroid person, the muscle relaxes so slowly that their foot returns like a door with a pneumatic closer on it—a little jerky relaxation. The electrocardiogram shows the same thing; the T-wave is delayed and flattened out. When your brain is tired, the nerves are slow to relax, so your sleep will not be as restorative as it would be in a high thyroid state.

**Josh Rubin:** Just to clarify regarding the slow relaxation of the calf muscle: Is that because of low blood sugar, increased serotonin, or calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of those things contribute. The thyroid allows you to take up oxygen efficiently and oxidize it completely. In proportion to the lack of thyroid, when you stimulate a muscle or nerve cell, it will use its oxygen inefficiently. It will allow calcium to enter the cell and keep it in an excited state, and it will tend to produce lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide produced under the influence of the thyroid is needed to carry the exciting calcium out of the cells and allow the cell to relax.

## Pulse and Temperature as Indicators

**Josh Rubin:** You mentioned high cholesterol is a huge indicator of low thyroid, as is the Achilles reflex. What about pulse and temperature? Why do you look at those while everyone else focuses on TSH and Free T4?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea of free and bound hormones is purely a laboratory construction. It’s a little bit analogous to reading tea leaves. Actually, when thyroid hormone is stuck to albumin protein in the blood, it has no trouble getting into cells.

Regarding TSH, I don't recommend it as a way to diagnose hypothyroidism, but if you are looking at a blood test, I recommend having as close to zero TSH as you can get. All the known effects of TSH are harmful. Doctors often argue that suppressing TSH causes osteoporosis, but the evidence is the opposite. Thyrotropin (TSH), like estrogen, increases osteoprotegerin, which increases the movement of calcium into your arteries and heart and out of the bones.

Regarding temperature, Dr. Broda Barnes practiced in Colorado and found temperature was an adequate way of diagnosing. He thought waking temperature should be around 97.8°F, rising to around 98.6°F after breakfast.

I observed that in hot, humid summer weather, hypothyroid people could maintain a normal core temperature, but often their pulse rate would still be low—45 to 65 beats per minute. I also saw people with extreme hypothyroidism oscillate between depression and mania. When depressed, their temperature was low. In the manic phase, they would wake up with a pulse of 80 and a normal temperature.

Furthermore, if you see a person's temperature and pulse rate fall after a good meal, that reveals a low metabolic rate that was being held up by emergency stimulation from adrenaline and cortisol. Food reduces stress, so when the stress hormones drop, the true low metabolism is revealed.

**Josh Rubin:** So, if someone has a low resting heart rate, society often thinks that means they are healthy, like Lance Armstrong. But you're saying a low resting heart rate can mean they are down-regulating their metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it tends to go with fertility problems, hormonal problems, low testosterone, increased estrogen, and degenerative problems.

## The Liver, Estrogen, and Thyroid Conversion

**Josh Rubin:** Let's talk about T3 and T4. Where does most of the conversion happen in the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes was one of the first to notice the importance of the liver in thyroid function. The Biskinds in the 1940s showed how the liver regulates hormones. If the liver was lacking thyroid, protein, or vitamins, estrogen would skyrocket. There is an antagonism focused on the liver between estrogen and thyroid.

The thyroid works partly by energizing the liver so it can detoxify everything, including removing 100% of the estrogen that reaches it. If your thyroid is low, the liver loses the ability to detoxify estrogen.

The liver is also the source of the most active thyroid hormone. About two-thirds of the thyroid used by the body is produced in the liver. If your liver isn't getting enough glucose or selenium, it is unable to convert thyroxine (T4) into T3. If you starve for 24 hours or exert too much energy, your liver isn't getting enough glucose to convert the T4 into active T3.

If a doctor prescribes only T4, it works fine in healthy young men. But women, because of higher estrogen levels, have more liver issues. A little problem with thyroid or estrogen means the liver allows estrogen to increase, which decreases the production of active thyroid hormone, creating a vicious circle.

**Josh Rubin:** So we need selenium and glucose to make the conversion. And estrogen itself will block the T4 to T3 conversion and back up the liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Once that happens, the estrogen can reach the point where it inhibits the thyroid gland itself. It inhibits the proteolytic enzyme that releases the hormone from the gland. This is where women tend to get goiters or thyroid enlargement, often diagnosed as Hashimoto's. Estrogen causes the pituitary to drive the thyroid harder via TSH, but simultaneously blocks the thyroid's ability to secrete, causing enlargement.

## The Dangers of T4 Monotherapy

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of people have high T4 lab values. What does that mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It very often goes with hypothyroidism. If your liver can't activate the hormone, the gland will go on producing it, and T4 will accumulate because your liver isn't using it up. A very high T4 level tends to slow down the production of T3.

I saw a patient who was slightly hypothyroid and prescribed T4. Her symptoms got worse. The doctor increased the dose until she reached 400 or 500 micrograms of T4, at which point she went into a myxedema coma. They injected pure T3, and she came right out of the coma. Her symptoms got worse directly in proportion to the increased dose of T4. It isn't rare for a woman to get worse symptoms—noises in the head, electrical sensations, swollen muscles—as a result of taking too much T4.

## Systemic Effects: Lactic Acid and PUFA

**Josh Rubin:** How does hypothyroidism affect systems like blood sugar, adrenaline, and digestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you aren't able to oxidize your sugar all the way to carbon dioxide, you produce lactic acid very easily. Even at rest, a person will produce lactic acid as if they were under strenuous exercise. Lactic acid turns on inflammatory mediators and acts as a toxin. Over time, it leads to fibrosis, arthritis, connective tissue diseases, and calcification of soft tissues.

**Josh Rubin:** It seems like regulating the thyroid affects so many systems—joint pain, digestion, menstrual problems.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because energy production shapes everything. The body is constantly renewing itself. If you aren't renewing yourself at a high rate, errors accumulate.

One reason thyroid problems get worse over time is that our diets contain thyroid-inhibiting substances, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The French did studies showing that the first effect of too much PUFA is to block the thyroid gland from secreting hormone. Then, it inhibits transport in the blood. Fish oil (5 and 6 unsaturated bonds) is an almost total inhibitor of thyroid transport. Linoleic acid inhibits it about 30%. Finally, it inhibits the cell's responsiveness to thyroid.

## Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** How do thyroid hormones raise CO2, and what are the advantages of higher CO2 levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Higher CO2 means you are oxidizing things completely. If you oxidize fats completely, you stop producing lactic acid. Carbon dioxide binds to our proteins, protecting them. It binds to hemoglobin and proteins with exposed amine groups. Carbon dioxide binds protectively to proteins, keeping them in the native, youthful state.

All of our peptide hormones—insulin, growth hormone, etc.—bind carbon dioxide, becoming a different substance. If we hyperventilate and blow out too much CO2, or if we are hypothyroid and produce lactic acid instead of CO2, our hormone system is deranged. CO2 is in itself anti-inflammatory.

## Nutrition for Thyroid Health

**Josh Rubin:** What are your recommendations for people who don't have a thyroid, or for general thyroid nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a non-industrial culture, people would get dietary thyroid by eating the whole animal—fish heads, sausage with beef thyroid thrown in. A natural diet provides the equivalent of half a grain of thyroid.

Regarding foods, avoid toxic foods like polyunsaturated fats and hard-to-digest starches (like beans) that irritate the intestine and create endotoxin. Emphasize sweet fruits, milk, cheese, eggs, shellfish, and gelatin-rich meats (oxtail, shank). Gelatin is pro-thyroid because it doesn't contain the precursors to serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** You’ve mentioned the "carrot salad" before. How does that help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The raw carrot contains fiber that cannot be digested, and it has mild antibiotic properties. It absorbs toxins and prevents their absorption. I had women measure their hormones, then eat a raw carrot daily. After just a few days, their hormones were back in a favorable state—reduced estrogen and cortisol, increased progesterone and thyroid—because of the cleansing effect on the intestine and liver.

**Josh Rubin:** What about foods to help the T4 to T3 conversion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very sweet, low-fiber foods. Well-strained orange juice from sweet oranges is the safest. It provides glucose for the liver. Also, if you have a centrifugal juicer, you can juice a raw potato and then cook the juice (like scrambling an egg) to get a safe, high-quality protein without the starch.

**Josh Rubin:** Why strained orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Commercial juices often use enzymatic processes to create "pulp" that is actually a type of fiber we can't digest, which feeds bacteria. If you make it yourself, straining it removes the indigestible fibers that would otherwise feed bacteria and create endotoxin.

**Josh Rubin:** And coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coconut oil is pro-thyroid. It helps the liver store glycogen and helps the body detox from unsaturated fats. It is anti-inflammatory. Refined coconut oil is often safer to avoid allergic reactions to the proteins in crude oil.

**Josh Rubin:** Any final nutritional recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If people eat vegetables, I encourage them to cook them to death. Boiling them for 40 minutes makes them much safer. Experiments in the 1940s showed that rats thrived on canned (cooked) vegetables but couldn't live on raw ones.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, we really appreciate you coming on and educating us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.

**Josh Rubin:** Have a good one. For the listeners, please understand the "why" behind these recommendations before you just start eating carrots or gelatin. Read Ray's articles and books. There are many pieces to the healing puzzle. Thanks for tuning in.
