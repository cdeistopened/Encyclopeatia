# EastWest Healing: Cholesterol and Saturated Fats
**Guest:** Dr. Raymond Peat
**Hosts:** Josh Rubin (Jeannie Rubin is absent for this episode)

## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** What up everyone? This is Josh Rubin from East West Healing and Performance. Today we are hosting a great radio show with Dr. Ray Peat. Jeannie will not be joining us today, so it's just me and Dr. Peat.

We do this show for the listeners because I know a lot of people are really into Ray’s philosophy and information. The show is on cholesterol and saturated fats, so try to revolve your questions around that.

Today’s topic is huge. We're going to get Ray Peat's philosophy on this. We'll cover why cholesterol is so important, why doctors are trying to lower it, why our physiology needs it, what it means if it's high or low, and why the right types of saturated fats are so important in our diet.

Ray, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Josh Rubin:** I wanted to know if you wanted to take a couple of minutes just to give a brief history of who you are and where you come from.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology, I was mostly studying language, literature, and painting. I had been interested in biology for a very long time, but I had a bad impression of academic biology from my high school experience.

In the 1940s, there was a very big change in the nature of American biology that was powered by industry and government promotion of the gene theory as opposed to the field theory in development and health. I waited a long time, until 1968, to actually enter a graduate program in biology. I had learned enough about universities to manage to get through the program without having too many conflicts with professors. Most of the professors were very committed to the genetic determinist idea of what an organism is. I was interested in the field concept and environmental influences on the organism. Nutrition is one of the most important environmental influences. I see our nature as being a matter of potential being realized according to the conditions of the environment, rather than the expression of a predetermined genetic program.

## The History of Anti-Cholesterol Bias

**Josh Rubin:** Why do you think America is so afraid of cholesterol and saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's driven primarily by the food industry wanting to sell their products: the seed oils. The seed oils were already seen to be toxic—causing sterility, degeneration of the brain and the gonads—probably from 1925, but especially in the 1930s and 40s. The very oxidizable seed oils were known to be toxic. That was one of the factors in researching Vitamin E as something to counteract the toxicity of the seed oils (unsaturated fats), as well as the toxicity of estrogen, which happens to synergize with unsaturated fats.

The pig industry had been looking for ways to make their animals gain weight and eat less food. George Burr, who is identified as the inventor of the essential fatty acid concept, himself discovered that the essential fatty acids slow the metabolic rate. Deficient animals eating sugar instead of unsaturated fats had about a 50% higher metabolic rate. They found that feeding soy and corn to the pigs, because of the unsaturated fats suppressing their metabolic rate, increased the profit—less food in, more pig out. At the same time, they noticed that it was lowering cholesterol as one of its toxic biological effects.

Around 1950, paint and oil chemists discovered how to make paints and plastics from petroleum. That decreased one of the big markets for soybeans. Henry Ford had imported soybeans to use in the car industry for plastics, but when the petroleum chemists learned how to use petroleum, that freed up the soybean market for pigs. Their production was great enough that they wanted to find new markets to replace the paint and plastics market. So, they started promoting the health idea of their soy oil, cottonseed oil, and safflower seed oil.

The only biological effect established for the seed oils, other than sterility and dementia, was that they lowered blood cholesterol. For several decades, people had noticed that cholesterol accumulated in the walls of blood vessels (atherosclerosis). Although the first person who discovered that in rabbits had dissolved the cholesterol in unsaturated vegetable oil, he realized that cholesterol by itself wasn't causing the disease. But the seed oil industry argued by association: if it's in the blood vessel and the blood, and their oil lowers the level in the blood, then you can prevent the disease.

However, in the 1930s, people had found that thyroid was enough to prevent atherosclerosis, and at the same time, it lowered cholesterol. Over the last 10 or 15 years, a Swedish doctor named Uffe Ravnskov has shown beautifully that there is no causal connection between atherosclerosis, heart disease, and the triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood. The experiments done in the 30s showed that hypothyroidism and the associated changes were what caused the atherosclerosis. The cholesterol seems to be there as a defensive reaction to protect the injured blood vessels.

## Saturated vs. Unsaturated Fats

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats for the listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It refers to the chain of carbon atoms in the fatty acid. In one case, they have all of the hydrogen atoms attached to them that are possible; they are saturated with hydrogen. If some of the carbon atoms lack the hydrogen, the absence makes them more flexible. Instead of being like a bottle brush bristling with hydrogen surrounding the chain of carbons, it's more like a necklace of beads—flexible.

Where the hydrogens are missing, the bonds can rotate more freely. If you get two, three, or five of those double bonds, the chain is bent at each place. You can get very flexible shapes when you have the highly unsaturated molecules.

You can see that flexibility when you put a bottle of oil in the refrigerator. Coconut oil is hard even at room temperature. Olive oil has to be much cooler before it starts solidifying because it's relatively saturated. Canola and corn oil have to be extremely cold before they solidify.

This is biologically important. If an organism lives at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and contained butterfat, its fats would be solid and unmanageable. In the tropics, even fish in the Amazon river have fat as saturated as butterfat. Chocolate and coconuts grow in places averaging close to 90 degrees, so they need to have very saturated fat just for the biochemical manipulation of the molecules. If you had unsaturated fat in a fish in the Amazon river, the fish would oxidize its fats in just a couple of days.

Even with a medium unsaturated oil, such as soy or corn oil, if you put a rubber hose into a cork in the top of a bottle and put the other end in a cup of water, leaving the bottle at room temperature, the water will rise up the tube as the oil consumes oxygen. It's a constant process. If you raise it to body temperature (98 degrees), the process is much faster, and you have sticky, rancid oil very quickly.

## Atherosclerosis and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** Most Western medicine literature talks about cholesterol and heart disease. What are your thoughts on atherosclerosis and heart disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) that we unavoidably get in our diet are constantly breaking down, producing free radicals and tending to cause inflammation and tissue injury. If anything is disturbing the metabolism of a cell, that's more likely to happen.

For example, normal oxidation through the mitochondrion keeps electrons tightly controlled. But if you take away some of the oxygen, the electrons will escape as free radical potentiators. Any stress on a cell puts out these electrons that can attack the exposed electron bonds in unsaturated fats. Saturated fats aren't open for stray electrons.

Every time you are limited in your delivery of oxygen to a cell, you're putting the unsaturated fats in the way of these stray electrons. Those start chain reactions that form lumps of material called age pigment or lipofuscin. These oxidized fat fragments attach to proteins and collect bits of iron. These lumps of age pigment, because of their iron and fat fragments, are able to catalyze the consumption of energy and waste oxygen. This accelerates the process because the real mitochondrion is further deprived of oxygen.

Before that happens, signals go out changing the conditions of the organism—activating hormones such as cortisol, estrogen, and growth hormones. These three hormones are closely connected to rising triglycerides and damage to the blood vessel wall. Cortisol increases estrogen, estrogen increases cortisol, and they both increase growth hormone. All of these tend to break down triglycerides into free fatty acids, which are more reactive and tend to become oxidized more quickly.

## Cholesterol and Stress

**Josh Rubin:** Why is cholesterol so important for our physiology, and why does it go up when one is stressed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pituitary senses something wrong in the organism and increases its ACTH, which drives the adrenal glands to take up cholesterol and synthesize it from raw materials. It directs the cholesterol into the mitochondrion to turn it into pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and finally cortisol.

Cortisol has a short-term defensive reaction against stress. One of its main effects is to turn protein into sugar for energy. But if you keep your cortisol up too long, you'll destroy too much of your protein tissues. Before the cortisol stage, the adrenal tissue will first produce pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA. It's only when those aren't enough that the progesterone will be converted into cortisol.

So, the increased production of cholesterol itself is a primitive defensive anti-stress system. Starting around 1920, people found that if they gave a lethal dose of poison to an animal—everything from pus to snake venom to heavy metals—if they gave it a good dose of cholesterol, it would survive. Cholesterol has a direct activating effect on producing more defensive steroids and interfering with the toxic effects of chemical and physical stresses. It is an incredibly broad-spectrum protective substance.

**Josh Rubin:** With most people, cholesterol goes up and never comes down. Is that a conversion issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40 years ago, researchers found that if thyroid hormone and Vitamin A nutrition were adequate, the amount of progesterone coming out of an ovary or adrenal gland exactly corresponded to the amount of cholesterol going in. A very big portion of the cholesterol is being turned into protective hormones. But it depends on thyroid and Vitamin A.

The higher your thyroid function, the more cholesterol you're consuming. In the 1930s, someone noticed that when the thyroid gland had been removed, cholesterol immediately went up. When they gave a thyroid supplement, the cholesterol would decrease. The blood cholesterol was a mirror image of their thyroid function.

If you have, say, a 500 mg cholesterol level, you can bring it down in a week to 200 or 180 just by giving frequent small doses of a quick-acting thyroid. That is protective because it allows them to produce progesterone and pregnenolone.

If you lack something needed to turn energy into cholesterol—for example, sugar—or if you are overloaded with unsaturated fats, you might not produce enough cholesterol. Sometimes a supplement of sugar is needed to bring up your production of cholesterol. You don't want your cholesterol to get below 160. Studies have shown that very low cholesterol levels make you susceptible to developing cancer, accidents, homicides, and suicide.

**Josh Rubin:** Some people say when they start following your philosophy, their cholesterol actually goes up. Is that because they are producing more T3 and utilizing more?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one is really sure what the optimal level of cholesterol is. Looking at old people in rest homes, the ones that lived the longest had pretty high cholesterol—I think 270 was the number that corresponded to the longest survival. In the Framingham study, people over the age of 50 who didn't have at least a 200 cholesterol level were more likely to develop dementia. In a study of violence, violent offenders were clearly connected with cholesterol levels below 180.

## Pregnenolone and Brain Chemistry

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on pregnenolone's effects on our brain chemistry?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several signals can tell your brain that you're suffering stress. Low blood sugar is one. Stress acts on the stability regulators of brain cells. GABA is a sleep-inducing peptide, a fragment of the amino acid glutamic acid. Glutamic acid excites the brain. If you take off the acid, it becomes Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), which sedates the brain.

A stressed brain will activate enzymes to produce GABA to turn off the excitation. Valium acts on the GABA stabilizing system. If something is preventing glutamic acid from being turned into sufficient GABA, Valium will fill in.

Progesterone and pregnenolone act on the GABA receptor system. Pregnenolone is basically a stabilizer at all levels of cells in the brain. Its effect is to imitate Valium, telling your pituitary that the stress is under control and to stop producing so much cortisol.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend using a supplement of pregnenolone to help balance that and lower cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on how far the system has deteriorated. Russians found that giving isolated mitochondria pregnenolone would structurally restore damaged mitochondria and allow them to begin producing more pregnenolone. This is a positive feedback loop: you give it some, and it makes more.

Ordinarily, you can make enough from converting sugar to cholesterol, and with thyroid and Vitamin A, converting cholesterol to other hormones. But when you have been poisoned with unsaturated oils or heavy metals, it helps to use all supports possible: thyroid supplements, pregnenolone, possibly DHEA and progesterone, saturated fats, sugar, and salt.

## Growth Hormone and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** Why is growth hormone inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most research is designed to praise its beneficial effects, but people who have been chronically deficient in it have a remarkable absence of atherosclerosis. Mice that are genetically deficient in pituitary hormones have no growth hormone; they aren't very big, but they live two or three times as long as normal mice.

When you have hypoglycemia, you increase your growth hormone, and it tends to come with other pituitary stress-responsive hormones. They are all harmful when they go on too long. People with gigantism or acromegaly have an extremely high incidence of atherosclerosis.

## HDL vs. LDL

**Josh Rubin:** Can you explain the difference between HDL and LDL?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both are able to participate in detoxification. The protein that helps to carry the cholesterol has specific anti-stress and antiviral activity.

The LDL is mostly the one that carries cholesterol into the places where it's needed: the brain, ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands, and skin. The HDL has some more specific anti-toxic effects. Toxins will tend to increase the HDL relative to the LDL. Chlorinated hydrocarbons, radiation, estrogen, and alcohol will increase HDL relative to LDL because of its anti-toxic effects.

## Light, Darkness, and Metabolism

**Josh Rubin:** How does lack of light cause an increase in cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Someone took blood samples every 15 minutes during the night. As soon as the lights went off, cortisol began rising. It shows that the stress system recognizes immediately that darkness is stress.

It seems that intrinsic oxidation and free radical production get out of control in proportion to the exposure to darkness. When you measure cytochrome oxidase—the enzyme that delivers food electrons to oxygen—during darkness, it degrades. After 12 to 15 hours of darkness, mitochondria swell up and some explode.

Cytochrome oxidase contains copper in the blue state of oxidation. Blue copper absorbs red light. Red light passes freely through tissue and is delivered to the copper in the oxidative enzyme, restoring the copper to its proper functional role. That's apparently what is lost during exposure to darkness. The enzyme wears out in the dark and needs to be recharged by light.

## Saturated Fats and Diet

**Josh Rubin:** I have a listener question: "It is possible to live entirely without eating fats because your body can make all the saturated fat it needs. What's the importance of consuming saturated fats?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One thing is that it makes the food much pleasanter to eat. It makes it digest more efficiently. Experiments with a loop of intestine found that digestion was poor until you had proteins, carbohydrates, and fats present at the same time. It’s a signal of satisfaction that helps to lower stress.

In experiments with rats using a purified diet, when saturated fats were added, they had cancer-free results similar to fat-free diets. It's a very small amount of unsaturated fat that is responsible for stress and cancer production—about a teaspoonful per day is enough to show a threshold increase in cancer.

When we eat natural foods, we're always getting some unsaturated fats. It's hard to get below that threshold. That is one argument for using carbohydrates as a major part of your energy supply. If we have extra carbohydrates, they will turn into saturated fats and extend the proportion, effectively lowering the unsaturated proportion below the carcinogenic threshold.

## Caller Segment: HIV and Immunity

**Caller (JP):** I have a friend who contracted HIV. I recommended saturated fat and aspirin, but his CD4 and CD8 counts dropped. Do you have something to help him? What about niacinamide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People with HIV often have very high polyunsaturated fats circulating. Niacinamide is something that will help lower the free fatty acids. Sugar, niacinamide, and aspirin are all things that help to lower the stress and keep the immune system up.

## Coconut Oil

**Josh Rubin:** You are a huge proponent of coconut oil. Can you elaborate on why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any of the saturated fats have an anti-inflammatory, protective effect. A group studying liver disease found that fish oils and seed oils increase liver inflammation and fibrosis. This can be blocked by saturated fats.

Coconut oil is in the medium chain length. The shortness of the chain means it is very mobile. Shorter saturated fats can be handled in the mitochondria without relying on the transport systems needed for longer chains. They can be oxidized as easily as glucose. They interfere with the anti-metabolic effects of unsaturated fats.

Unsaturated fats interfere with thyroid function at all points—secretion, transport, and cellular response. Coconut oil gets in the way of these suppressive effects, especially in the mitochondrion where it is quickly burned for energy.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about coconut oil's effect on the pancreas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bernardo Houssay saw that the pituitary would activate the adrenals to increase cortisol and raise blood sugar, while the pancreas was making insulin to lower blood sugar. Coconut oil and sugar worked very similarly to keep the system working to allow insulin both to function and to be produced.

## Milk and Calcium

**Josh Rubin:** Why is milk so important? Many nutritionists say it's inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the calcium content makes it anti-inflammatory. Calcium increases the oxygen-using ability of the mitochondria, similar to thyroid. Systemically, it suppresses the parathyroid hormone (PTH).

PTH is a stress hormone that, when continued too long, contributes to degenerative diseases. Having a chronically high calcium intake gives you a chronically low parathyroid level. Keeping PTH down protects your arteries, kidneys, and bones, and allows your insulin to keep free fatty acids under control.

## Eggs

**Josh Rubin:** Why are eggs an important staple?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With the industrialization of the egg industry, the cholesterol content went down and the polyunsaturated content went up. If you can get non-industrial eggs from chickens that have pastures, they are much better. The cholesterol in the egg seems to be one of its important nutritional values. About 600 milligrams of cholesterol in your diet increases the oxidative stability of your lipid particles in your bloodstream.

## Caller Segment: Free Fatty Acids

**Caller (Danny Roddy):** A lot of people in the Paleo sphere are under the impression that free fatty acids in the blood are a good thing. Can you explain why that might be harmful to the liver and thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's my main argument against eating a high meat diet. Free fatty acids are one of the means by which stress causes its damage. I've known people eating two or three pounds of meat a day who were getting sicker as their free fatty acids increased.

Just about everything that goes wrong involves free fatty acid increase. If they are totally saturated fatty acids, such as from coconut oil, those are less harmful, but they still tend to shift the mitochondrial metabolism away from using glucose and fructose, lowering carbon dioxide production.

## Caller Segment: Mitochondria

**Caller (Liam):** What does cholesterol have to do with mitochondrial respiration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, it stabilizes it and protects it against free fatty acids. Besides stabilizing, it actually stimulates respiration and oxygen consumption. It functions as an antioxidant.

The proteins that make up the mitochondrion have a very liquid property. If you remove all the oil-soluble materials, you still have a mitochondrion there, which shows the membrane is really a protein structure. That protein structure is reinforced and stabilized by binding with cholesterol molecules.

## Caller Segment: Coconut Oil Reaction

**Caller (415):** Coconut oil sometimes makes people feel sick or achy. Is that because of the salicylates? Is it better to get refined oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I recommend the completely deodorized coconut oil. The research was always done with the filtered kind that had no odor. Some people are allergic to the aromatic, tasty things in the coconut. Making it completely odorless is safest. It just takes a spoonful of the very odorous stuff to make me sick for about three days.

**Josh Rubin:** Could it be that people aren't used to eating saturated fat and have an overburdened liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid people have very touchy gallbladders. It just takes a little grease to trigger a gallbladder reaction. Getting the estrogen down is the basic thing to help the gallbladder.

## Statins and Lowering Cholesterol

**Josh Rubin:** What is the risk of taking a statin and lowering your cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tendency to become violent or suicidally depressed, or increasing the tendency towards dementia. It makes your red blood cells less stable. Cholesterol is an intrinsic part of chromosome and DNA function and cell division regulation.

Statins interfere with the whole chain of synthesis, including Coenzyme Q10 production. That is likely a factor in why they cause bones to rot and muscles to break down catastrophically—rhabdomyolysis.

**Josh Rubin:** To summarize, what can people do to normalize their cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A daily raw carrot will tend to lower your cortisol and estrogen. Stopping that stress will let your thyroid work better and increase progesterone, accelerating the conversion of cholesterol into protective hormones. Avoiding polyunsaturated fats is essential for your thyroid to recover. Everything that increases your metabolic rate, such as calcium and sodium, is essential.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, anything else you want to add?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The important thing is not to think of unsaturated fats as anything essential. That has never been proved. George Burr himself proved that unsaturated fats slow the metabolic rate. The increased metabolic rate from a pro-thyroid diet will increase your nutrient need for copper, selenium, and B vitamins. Your activity level governs the amount of saturated fat, carbohydrate, and protein that you need.

**Josh Rubin:** Thank you so much, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you. Bye.
