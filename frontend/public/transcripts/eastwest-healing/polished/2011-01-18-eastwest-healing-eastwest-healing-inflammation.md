## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome back to a brand new season of Holistic Living with Josh and Jeannie Rubin. We are really excited this year to launch a series of shows with our one and only Dr. Raymond Peat from RayPeat.com. Today, we are going to be talking about inflammation: his view on where it comes from, what is involved, and what in our environment and bodies creates it. Our goal this year is to give everyone an education, whether you are a practitioner or a layperson. We feel Ray can offer a lot of insight into your physiology. We want to start from the basework and move up to solutions. Jeannie has Ray on the line. Hi, Ray. How are you doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good. Have you talked anything about the history of what people believe about inflammation?

**Josh Rubin:** Based on your science and research, you have a very different view on a lot of things. Why don't you explain the traditional definition and then give your definition of what inflammation is?

## The History of Inflammation and Immunity

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Elie Metchnikoff, more than 100 years ago, discovered phagocytes and explored the immune process. He observed that when you put a splinter into an organism, white blood cell-type cells engulfed it. They would eat it if it was edible, or just concentrate and form a sheath or a pus deposit around it.

For Metchnikoff, immunity was this process in which certain cells protect the organism basically by eating the problem. That was considered the essence of inflammation, and it was a good thing. He was looking at primitive organisms and viewed this eating process as part of the developmental process—maintaining and generating the proper structure of the organism.

There is an English doctor, Jamie Cunliffe, who is following up on Metchnikoff's idea of what the immune system is. As she expresses it, it is the process of cleaning up messes. The general idea is that our immune system is primarily to maintain our organism. The idea of it being directed at foreign invaders is really secondary to the process of fixing anything that goes wrong in the organism.

However, Paul Ehrlich, who shared the Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff, was working on toxins to kill invading organisms. The idea of killing invaders came to be identified with immunity and inflammation throughout the 20th century. Inflammation was seen as a good defensive reaction against invaders. But if you try to continue the Metchnikoff-Cunliffe idea, inflammation really is a problem rather than a solution. When things are working smoothly, we can either tolerate the presence of foreign organisms or eliminate them without a big mess being produced.

## Inflammation, Aging, and Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA)

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 20 years ago, people started shifting their thinking and seeing that degenerative diseases are all inflammatory processes. Hardening of the arteries, brain degenerative diseases of all sorts including Alzheimer's, and aging in all its aspects involve inflammation rather than simply cleaning up the mess quietly.

This suggests looking at the earliest stages of development—not just evolutionary, but during gestation. When the fetus or embryo is injured, the tissue is simply repaired without producing a scar or inflammation. The prenatal functioning of the immune system is basically what Metchnikoff was talking about: keeping the integrity of the organism and not worrying about killing invaders.

What happens after the fetus is born? There is no longer the mother's body and the placenta filtering the environment. All mammals have a very low concentration of the so-called "essential fatty acids"—the polyunsaturated fats—at birth. As these are taken in from the environment without the filtering process of the placenta, the action of the immune system starts to produce inflammation, scarring, and defective healing.

It is the progressive accumulation of polyunsaturated fats that starts what we know as inflammation. When cells are inflamed, they shift from an oxygen-based metabolism to a simple sugar-consuming metabolism and are in an excited state that promotes cell division. In this oxygen-wasting environment, the cells produce collagen to repair, but the ability to remove the collagen is impaired by the presence of polyunsaturated fats.

The breakdown of polyunsaturated fats involves the production of prostaglandins. These aren't part of the essential development of the embryo, but they become very important as we begin eating polyunsaturated fats. The presence of these excitatory mediators—prostaglandins and free fatty acids—blocks the cleanup process, keeps the inflammation going, and leads to the production of a scar. That is part of why vitamin E, by opposing those processes, can practically eliminate scarring if you get a very high concentration in the presence of the healing process.

## PUFA and Fetal Development

**Jeannie Rubin:** You mentioned the placenta working as a filter to protect the immune system against polyunsaturated fatty acids. If a mother has a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, would the placenta still act as a filtering agent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Normally, yes. Even people who have been on a high n-3 and n-6 diet have babies that come out "essential fatty acid deficient" according to current definitions. That is the argument for putting fish oil in baby formula. However, if you look at calves, they are extremely deficient at birth. Even the small amount of polyunsaturated fat in milk—maybe 2%—will cause them to gradually load up as they grow.

When people have tried to supplement pregnant women to correct that universal "deficiency" of the newborn, they find that the babies are born smaller and are more susceptible to allergies and inflammatory diseases. The worst part is that their brains are smaller. People trying to show that the brain requires n-3 fats fed these to pregnant women expecting the fetus to learn more easily, but in fact, they found they didn't learn as well.

One of the events caused by the excess of n-3 in particular is that the metabolism of tryptophan, which should go largely to form niacin and melatonin, is diverted. This type of unsaturated fat causes tryptophan to be metabolized in a toxic direction, producing less niacin and more of the excitotoxic quinolinic acid and carcinogenic indole derivatives.

## The Role of Endotoxin in Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** What do you think causes inflammation? Is it just from polyunsaturated fatty acids in the food, or is it happening in utero? Where is it coming from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The challenge is what starts it. Instead of being a quick corrective process, the presence of unsaturated fats causes inflammation, calcium uptake, accelerated growth, collagen production, and eventually calcification of the fibrotic scar material.

The worst challenge that we are constantly exposed to is bacterial toxin production in the intestine. Everyone has it unless they are germ-free lab rats. The balance of colonic bacteria depends on what we eat, but there are always some producing endotoxins. These are lipopolysaccharide molecules that create stress, poisoning, and physical disruption of cells lining the intestine.

Part of the reaction to this is to produce serotonin. The intestine is where about 95% of our body's serotonin is produced. It stimulates peristalsis and activates defensive processes. But when there is an overbalance of endotoxins, the serotonin starts to be the main problem. Serotonin activates the formation of prostaglandins from fatty acids and the release of nitric oxide.

When there isn't enough energy supplied to the organism and there is too much endotoxin, the nitric oxide and serotonin create inflammation in the wall of the intestine and blood vessels, letting endotoxin get into the bloodstream. This causes systemic effects, releasing more nitric oxide and serotonin. Serotonin then becomes the main factor in aging and accumulated stress effects.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on what endotoxin is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is normally just part of the bacterial cell structure. The covering of the bacteria contains a starch-like molecule with some fatty acids attached to it. Organisms have been dealing with them for so long that they are our basic signal of the need to defend ourselves against the environment. They are very good triggers for the production of serotonin and nitric oxide. All bacteria "leak" these little molecules as they are forming new bacteria or being stressed.

**Josh Rubin:** How do we get exposed to these? From meats or other foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are constantly being produced in the lower small intestine and colon. The upper part of the intestine is normally free of bacteria. But when we eat undigestible food—starches, complex fibrous materials, lignins—these feed different combinations of bacteria.

For example, if you feed rats a type of starch that humans can't digest but bacteria can, the rats become anxious and aggressive because of the disturbance of serotonin and nitric oxide. The amount and type of bacterial toxin are determined mostly by the presence of things in our foods that we can't digest. Uncooked vegetables will very quickly start producing bacterial overgrowth. If that material gets mixed with proteinaceous things, like undercooked beans, you get a different category of toxins called indoles, which resemble serotonin and histamine.

## The Liver, Hormones, and Systemic Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** How does endotoxin affect the liver and perpetuate the cycle of inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver should absolutely destroy any toxins that reach it. But when the intestine is in bad shape, or if the liver isn't well-nourished and well-supplied with thyroid hormone, it loses the energy to produce antitoxic processes. A poorly nourished or low-thyroid liver lets the junk absorbed through the permeable intestine into the system. Then you get leakiness of blood vessels, which in the brain can cause symptoms like multiple sclerosis, edema in other organs, and inflammatory processes.

When the liver gets weakened by bacterial toxins, it also begins to fail to regulate the body's own hormones. For example, estrogen accumulates. In a fertility clinic, doctors gave infertile women an antibiotic. Shortly after, the women reported less fatigue and fewer premenstrual symptoms. Their blood tests showed that right after taking the antibiotic, estrogen levels went down sharply, progesterone went up, and cortisol went down. They created a fertile endocrine pattern just by taking an antibiotic.

I've seen the same thing just with a carrot salad. The carrot is an unusual vegetable in being antifungal, antibacterial, and very resistant to the production of endotoxin. It works like an antibiotic on the intestine, reducing endotoxins.

**Josh Rubin:** What happens when these hormones are dysregulated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the liver is failing and cortisol and estrogen are high, that goes with a systemic excess of serotonin and deficiency of thyroid hormones. Serotonin lowers cellular oxidative metabolism and energy production.

One of the biological effects of high serotonin is to allow rodents to hibernate. When they are under stress, serotonin goes up, allowing them to drop their body temperature and go into a torpor. When people—who can't hibernate—are exposed to the endotoxin, serotonin, free fatty acid, and estrogen pattern, it lowers their ability to produce energy and tends to cause body temperature to fall.

As a defensive system, serotonin increases pituitary hormones to compensate. It drives the thyroid gland harder (stimulating TSH), but it also stimulates ACTH, prolactin, gonadotropins, and growth hormone. It turns on the pituitary to try to drive everything up to compensate for the fact that mitochondrial energy systems are being blocked.

**Josh Rubin:** Just to clarify, you are naming specific hormones that create inflammation, pull calcium from the bone, drop body temperature, and inhibit the immune system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Doctors like to see these pituitary hormones in a "normal" range. They will tell you that if you take thyroid to suppress your TSH, you are going to cause problems. But in fact, the TSH itself causes most of the problems identified with hypothyroidism. High serotonin is associated with low thyroid function and high TSH, but the TSH itself contributes to atherosclerosis, increased blood lipids, high blood pressure, and a range of inflammatory processes.

## Anti-Inflammatory Foods and Calcium

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about foods that are anti-inflammatory versus inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium is a central thing. It stimulates cell energy production. When the cell has what it needs—sugar, vitamins, and minerals—calcium will increase oxidative metabolism. A calcium deficiency turns on inflammation-related processes to attempt to correct the deficiency. This eventually leads to the calcification of soft tissues.

This is the main reason I recommend using milk rather than meat: the high calcium content. Meat has a very high phosphate ratio to calcium. Eggs would have the right ratio if people would eat the shell as well as the egg. With milk, you get a very good ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

The parathyroid hormone (PTH) is suppressed when we eat enough calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K. PTH has inflammation-promoting effects. So, keeping our hormones low is really one of the goals of eating right. The pituitary should be quiet, PTH should be low, and estrogen and cortisol should be low. The protective steroids—pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA—are produced by getting enough vitamin A, vitamin E, and the oil-soluble vitamins K and D. Keeping polyunsaturated fats down is essential for all of these.

## Silent Inflammation and Symptoms

**Jeannie Rubin:** When people think of inflammation, they relate it to redness, swelling, and pain. How would someone know if they are suffering from underlying inflammation aside from arthritic conditions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Defects in the energy process will show up very early as poor sleep quality, a tendency towards insomnia, fatigue, excitability, and nervous problems like an inability to concentrate or being twitchy and tense. The energy of the nervous system is probably the most sensitive indicator of a process tending in the direction of too much inflammation.

**Jeannie Rubin:** Regarding polyunsaturated fatty acids, should people eliminate them 100% or is moderation okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A healthy 8-year-old with an intense metabolic rate can burn a large amount of polyunsaturated fats so they accumulate more slowly. Once your metabolism has slowed down after puberty, a high likelihood of it getting incorporated into your tissues is the rule.

Once your body has incorporated these pro-inflammatory materials, every time you are under stress or haven't eaten for a certain length of time, your body will resort to burning the liberated fats. These come partly from your fat tissue and partly from the breakdown of other cells. If you can dispose of these toxic stored materials through a healthy liver, you can excrete them. But if your liver is losing energy, your tissues will have to oxidize them for energy. That is where they poison the energy-producing apparatus and turn into inflammatory mediators.

You can limit that breakdown by keeping saturated fats in your diet. Coconut oil has enough short-chain, water-soluble fatty acids that they will be taken up by preference and protect the mitochondria from the stress-released polyunsaturated fats. Fruit also helps; the sugar restrains tissue breakdown, and the minerals (potassium, magnesium, calcium) act somewhat like insulin to inhibit tissue breakdown.

## Exercise, Cortisol, and Nutrition

**Caller (GP):** What is your advice to reduce cortisol secretion during a workout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several years ago, a study took blood samples from people before and after a jog. Some ate breakfast before, and some didn't. They found that people who exercised on an empty stomach had broken chromosomes in their white blood cells. It is sort of like radiation injury to exercise on an empty stomach. It seems that the sugars and minerals in breakfast—probably just a glass of orange juice and milk—would be enough to prevent that stress-induced chromosome damage.

**Caller (GP):** How about bitter chocolate to prevent cortisol secretion before a workout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chocolate has a very high protein content, specifically leucine. Leucine acts like insulin and helps to prevent tissue breakdown. So chocolate is an anabolic protein.

**Caller (GP):** Is it okay to eat chocolate alone or with other food before training?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's good to have some sugar with it.

**Josh Rubin:** That's a great question. It highlights using nutrition to match the physiology of the body rather than just supplements.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are some supplements that are worse than others. Probably the two most dangerous are the carotenes—because they are polyunsaturated—and tryptophan. Tryptophan and 5-HTP (hydroxy-tryptophan) activate the inflammation process very directly.

## SSRIs and Thyroid Support

**Josh Rubin:** Is there anything else regarding inflammation you want to mention?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another dangerous thing many people are using now is Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). To the extent that they raise serotonin, they are being found responsible for increased osteoporosis and breast cancer. I think they will probably be found to contribute to obesity as well.

**Josh Rubin:** What do you recommend for people whose doctors tell them they need these?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things that promote your real energy production while lowering inflammation. Thyroid hormone itself is anti-inflammatory, partly by suppressing the pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Things that support the thyroid—such as saturated fats, sugars, salts, and electrolytes like calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium—help to protect tissues and work with the thyroid to produce the right kind of steroids, like pregnenolone and progesterone.

## Closing Thoughts

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is one little anti-inflammatory tidbit that is very easy to do. Once inflammation starts to lower your energy, it becomes a vicious circle. Just having cold feet and cold hands creates an inflammatory condition. When the blood drops a few degrees to circulate through your cold feet, it releases inflammatory mediators. Just sleeping with a wool cap and warm socks can help greatly with inflammation as well as insomnia problems.

**Josh Rubin:** We can guarantee we'll be at home tonight sleeping with wool caps.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Also, calcification and osteoporosis are two very important aspects of inflammation. The inflammatory substances—prostaglandins, serotonin, TSH, cytokines, interleukins—break down healthy bone structure and at the same time put calcium into your arteries, brain, and pineal gland. Taking aspirin, for example, to lower inflammation will help to prevent calcification of your arteries and help to strengthen the bones.
