## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** All right everyone, welcome to today's show with Ray Peat, Ph.D. I want to thank everyone once again for tuning into our show every month. Last month's show with Lita Lee was great, so if you didn't have a chance to listen to that, go to our Blog Talk Radio show and check that out.

Today we're doing a question and answer show with Ray Peat. I know a lot of people have been really waiting for this show. If you want to learn more about Ray, his website is RayPeat.com. He has tons of articles on his site that will probably keep you busy for the next 50 years. He has books you can order, and a newsletter that is well worth the money.

Ray has his Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught at many schools including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and Blake College. He started his work with progesterone-related hormones in 1968, did a paper on physiology, chemistry, and physics in 1971, and his dissertation at the University of Oregon in 1972, outlining his ideas regarding progesterone and the hormones closely related to it as protectors of the body structure and energy against harmful effects of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen.

Ray, are you on the line?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Josh Rubin:** Is there anything else you want to add before we get going?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that covered everything.

## Iron Toxicity and Estrogen

**Josh Rubin:** I have a lot of questions here. I have been getting a lot of questions from people regarding iron. A lot of people want a summary on your thoughts about iron because you believe it's a heavy metal, it's toxic, and it has all these effects on the body. Could you clarify the dangers of iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Wherever iron gets loose, it is available to react with things like polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), but also protein and nucleic acids. The reactive form of iron is the reduced ferrous form rather than the fully oxidized ferric form. That means that if you don't get enough oxygen to your tissues, the iron tends to get reduced by glutathione. People talk about oxidative stress, but reductive stress is really what you have to worry about in relation to iron.

Alcohol, for example, interferes with the use of oxygen and causes the reduced glutathione to accumulate, shifting the ratio towards reduction. That activates iron, reduces it to the reactive ferrous form, and causes damage.

Iron accumulates faster than it should under the influence of estrogen. Inability to use oxygen properly intensifies the absorption of iron, and that seems to be what estrogen is for: to create the illusion of an oxygen deprivation so that you absorb more iron. They've tested the absorption percentage of a dose of iron in women versus men, and women absorbed nine times as much iron. That's primarily the influence of estrogen.

Unfortunately, besides making the body absorb it, estrogen also tends to create the conditions that make iron toxic and puts it into the reduced reactive form. One of the main things that activated iron attacks is the polyunsaturated fatty acid. That creates a vicious circle in which the estrogen increases the most reactive PUFA, which activate and increase the quantity of estrogen. Both of those contribute to the activation and intensification of iron toxicity. You can break the cycle in different ways: donating blood to get rid of iron or doing things to interrupt the estrogen-fatty acid cycle.

**Josh Rubin:** If you have low hemoglobin, is it still safe to donate blood, or are there alternatives?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's no blood test that I know of that will really say anything meaningful about your iron status because the iron tends to hide in your liver and bone marrow. The fact that an iron supplement increases red blood cell count or hemoglobin doesn't mean they were deficient in iron. They used to treat anemia with doses of arsenic; the arsenic creates the stress that tells your body you need more iron and more blood. Any stress that interferes with oxygen use will drive up the blood production system.

**Josh Rubin:** When you see low hemoglobin, would that be due to estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in all animals that have estrogen, the female tends to look slightly anemic because it slows the production of red blood cells. Lowering the body temperature is one of the actions of estrogen, as is slowing down thyroid function. Probably the most common cause of apparent anemia, as Broda Barnes pointed out, is hypothyroidism.

He mentioned an experiment where they folded a rat's tail back and stitched it into the abdomen so it was kept at core body temperature. It quickly began producing red blood cells just by raising the temperature. So, the safest way to treat anemia might be to wear long wool socks to warm the extremities.

**Josh Rubin:** What is copper's role in regards to iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its primary role is in the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase. That is probably the reason that copper is essential for constructing the hemoglobin molecule.

**Josh Rubin:** So you feel that most people actually have higher amounts of iron in the liver and bone marrow, and they might be showing up low on a lab because of absorptive issues or hypothyroidism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In men, it accumulates continuously with aging. Menstruation probably helps women avoid the accumulation until they stop menstruating, and then the curve is maybe even steeper than men's. I think menstruation is one of the factors that makes women have a greater longevity.

There was a study of immigrant fruit pickers' children in California. They didn't get a good diet, but they ate lots of oranges. They had an average hemoglobin of 10, which is considered tending towards anemia, but they found that these kids didn't get infectious diseases like the well-fed city kids who had lots of hemoglobin. They've seen that same thing in Africa; when they would have campaigns to give iron supplements, lots of people would come down with malaria because iron activates the growth of germs and weakens our immune system.

One of the tests that is meaningful in the blood, but seldom done, is the iron saturation. People tend to be resistant to cancer development if the saturation is somewhat low, like 25%.

## ADD, ADHD, and Hashimoto's

**Josh Rubin:** We have a caller. Chris Dillon, you're on the air.

**Caller (Chris):** I have two questions. Regarding ADD and ADHD, as we've been seeing a rise of these diagnoses in the last couple of decades, do you feel that sugar is the problem, or could it be more of the polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the unsaturated fats. The sugar tends to move everything in the right direction, away from brain malfunction. The polyunsaturated fats interfere with attention and increase adrenaline, the sympathetic nervous system, and the stress hormones. I think that's probably the main thing, as well as hypothyroidism, that keeps the front part of the brain from getting enough energy to focus.

**Caller (Chris):** My second question is regarding Hashimoto's disease. Can you explain the proper way for it to be diagnosed? I realize that sometimes the anti-thyroid antibodies found in blood really don't have any relation to the thyroid gland.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, those antibodies interact with cartilage of the joints just about as well. It's really a connective tissue inflammatory disease which goes with hypothyroidism. The cartilage is one of the first places that you see hypothyroidism in children. It accounts for why hypothyroid kids tend to be knock-kneed. The cartilage in the knees and the elbows is basically swollen.

**Caller (Chris):** So basically a lot of people walk around being misdiagnosed for this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Josh Rubin:** I was reading one of your old articles on Hashimoto's and thyroiditis. You talk about how estrogen affects the colloid and stimulates it, but inhibits the proteolytic enzymes to break it down. Is that why a lot of people are getting diagnosed with Hashimoto's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The whole idea of autoimmune disease is off the mark. I think of the immune system as a clean-up system. The antibodies help the phagocytes remove debris. If the debris is caused by low thyroid causing the connective tissue to swell, the immune system has to come in and try to help clean out the junk that builds up.

## Body Temperature and Stress Reserves

**Josh Rubin:** Caller from the 678, you're on the air.

**Caller (678):** How long would you say it would take someone whose body temperature has historically been in the low to mid 97s for that to stabilize if they institute some of your recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen a couple of people do it in three or four days—very skinny people who had been on a pure soy tofu diet. As soon as they started eating eggs and oranges, they just popped up out of there. A couple of people who had been diagnosed as having broken pituitary glands with no function at all saw all of their pituitary hormones pop back as soon as they started eating rationally.

**Caller (678):** My second question is regarding Hans Selye's work. It seems like he believes we have an absolute reserve of energy to deal with stress and that any stressful event can deplete this. What do you think of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think where he left it is where the issue of cumulative buildup of iron and PUFA comes in. Both long-chain polyunsaturated fats and iron accumulate with aging, stress, and under the influence of estrogen. He wasn't looking far enough to see how those factors interacted with stress.

During prolonged adaptation, estrogen, growth hormone, and inflammatory mediators accumulate. Estrogen buildup begins to directly drive the adrenal gland. When that reaches a certain point, you can actually get bleeding in the adrenal gland and death of the cortical cells just from an excess of estrogen. The systemic effect of stress is what he neglected to think about when he talked about the reserve, innate amount of energy.

## Inflammation and Weight Loss

**Josh Rubin:** In one of your old newsletters regarding autoimmunity, you talked about Metchnikoff. You argued that inflammation was a pathological reaction rather than being a healthy part of a defensive immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's mostly me. For Metchnikoff, he saw the white blood cells going in and curing the problem. But after the medical establishment took it over, they created the idea of inflammation being the curative process. But the swelling, the redness, the pain—these are pathological.

The immune system should work like it does in the prenatal state. In the embryonic and fetal state, injury is corrected without inflammation. The cells just repair the damage in an efficient way and don't leave a scar. When you keep the carbon dioxide and sugar where they should be, you basically get fetal or embryonic healing without a scar and without inflammation. I see inflammation as an inability to deliver what's needed to repair the damage.

**Josh Rubin:** I have a lot of questions on weight loss. People begin to follow your philosophies and notice their energy goes up, but they actually gain weight. Can you elaborate on why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gaining weight probably isn't the issue; it's gaining inches and bulging. When you're doing everything just right, very likely you will rebuild muscles that were damaged by stress and poor nutrition. As those muscles grow, the circumference of your thighs, hips, and belly should be decreasing even though your weight is increasing.

When I first experimented with DHEA, I noticed after a week or two that my waist seemed to be reappearing. My pants were getting looser, but I was exactly the same weight. I was simply growing more lean tissue and burning up some of the fat.

**Josh Rubin:** So for a lot of people, it's actually a sign that your body is moving in the right direction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. But if someone is putting down fat rather than muscle—their pants are getting too tight—they're just eating too much, probably too much fat or total calories. I've averaged over the years probably a gallon of milk a day, but that's always been 1% milk. Even at two quarts of milk, a person doesn't want to have whole milk at 3 or 4% fat.

## Aromatase Inhibitors and Liver Health

**Josh Rubin:** What are your feelings on aromatase inhibitors? People suggest taking calcium D-glucarate or DIM.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically, they're usually selling just powdered cabbage leaves. That has been tested and found somewhat estrogenic in itself.

The estrogen aromatase activating effect of PUFA is antagonized when you shift the balance to saturated fats. Aspirin, by blocking the formation of prostaglandins and reducing inflammation, interrupts the effect of the PUFA. Aspirin is a very effective aromatase inhibitor, but the drug companies don't want people to know that.

**Josh Rubin:** If people just eat a diet void of unsaturated fats, wouldn't that inhibit aromatase enzymes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Thyroid inhibits aromatase. Anything that lowers cortisol inhibits it, because cortisol is a major activator.

**Josh Rubin:** If people start to eat this way—increase saturated fats, take a thyroid glandular—is it dangerous because you're detoxing the liver? Is it dangerous because of stored iron?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The iron, if it's in the oxidized state, is just sitting there doing no harm. It forms little granules and doesn't get out to do anything.

## Coffee and Adrenal Fatigue

**Josh Rubin:** Can you summarize your thoughts on coffee? Many say coffee causes adrenal fatigue, but you say it has benefits.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you have any idea who started the idea of adrenal fatigue? I've been trying to find out who is responsible for that word.

Coffee contains a lot of good things besides the caffeine. It's an extremely concentrated source of magnesium, niacin, and other B vitamins. The caffeine has an antioxidant effect. As long as you use it with food, it tends to stabilize your blood sugar and reduce inflammation.

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding adrenal fatigue, I feel people took Hans Selye's work on the General Adaptation Syndrome and ran with it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know where "exhaustion" is, where the adrenal gland dies. You don't want to get to exhaustion, but the idea of fatigue seems to be something else.

If you have enough cholesterol, are eating a good diet with vitamin A, and your thyroid is okay, you will be able to produce pregnenolone and progesterone. Progesterone in itself has all of the functions of the adrenal hormones. Hans Selye took out animals' adrenal glands, and if they were pregnant, they didn't have any symptoms at all until they gave birth. That led him to give progesterone to animals that had their adrenal glands removed, and they lived fully normal lifespans.

With adequate vitamin A and thyroid, you will convert cholesterol into pregnenolone and progesterone. Also, the adrenals are very good at repairing themselves.

**Josh Rubin:** You talk about how using coffee is important—sipping it after a meal with cream and sweetener.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Taking it with or after the meal has basically none of the harmful effects. I've known several people who said a sip of coffee would make them feel shattered, but I told them to put some heavy cream and sugar in it and take it only with a meal. Within three or four days, these people were happy coffee drinkers.

## Fructose and Fatty Liver

**Josh Rubin:** There are people like Dr. Mercola promoting that fructose causes diabetes and fatty liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a few days ago, I heard from someone in New Zealand who had been diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. He started a diet that included 300 grams of fructose every day. He now has a new diagnosis: his liver has no fat problem.

**Josh Rubin:** So everyone saying fructose causes fatty liver is missing the boat because it's the unsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. My newsletter on sugar questions goes through the history of how that fructose phobia evolved. It's very closely connected to the cholesterol doctrine of heart disease and the idea of essential fatty acids being beneficial. Meanwhile, science was showing that the so-called essential fatty acids are toxic and carcinogenic.

## Pig Fat and T3 Supplementation

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asks: You mentioned that pigs fed soybeans have unsaturated fat. If their fat was truly unsaturated, how come bacon is still solid at room temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was a kid, I would get blocks of lard and they were definitely solid at room temperature, just like butter. But the lard I've seen in recent years, which is now slightly over 30% PUFA, is soft at room temperature. The fat droplets in bacon are enclosed in cells and connected by connective tissue, so even if it was 100% PUFA, it would still have a white, firm appearance.

**Josh Rubin:** What is your opinion on time-released T3 versus basic Cytomel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard from several people who were having either overdose effects or no effects from time-release. A lawyer had compounded time-release T3 analyzed by laboratories, and no T3 could be found in it. If you compound it carelessly, T3 is easily destroyed or oxidized. With the wrong time-release agent, it might permanently bind the T3 or release it as soon as it hits stomach acid. Generally, I don't think the idea of a patented brand name medicine is good, but in the case of T3, I haven't seen a good other product besides Cytomel.

## The Carrot and Carbon Dioxide

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend eating the carrot before, with, or after a meal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually it's just eating the carrot. If you eat it with a meal, you might slow digestion to the point that you aren't getting your food as expected, and you might feel shaky. But if a person wants to reduce their fat absorption, eating the carrot with the meal will accelerate weight loss.

**Josh Rubin:** Can adding baking soda to orange juice help increase carbon dioxide levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you put it in acid, baking soda is going to bubble off most of the carbon dioxide. Some will dissolve in the water, and it might increase your systemic CO2 a little bit. There have been experiments with bicycle racers where they took a tablespoon of baking soda before the race and performed better, either due to increased sodium or CO2.

## Gallbladder, PUFA Detox, and Blood Pressure

**Josh Rubin:** If someone doesn't have a gallbladder, is coconut oil the best source of fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think just eating things in a mixed form in small amounts is important. If you don't have a gallbladder, the bile is still going to be there, but it's coming out in dribbles rather than surges.

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding detoxing from PUFAs, does it take four years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments found that it depends on the size of the fat cell. It's a slow process to randomly renew the composition of the fat cells.

**Josh Rubin:** If someone feels they are getting worse—more hypoglycemic—is that because of PUFA detox?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping your blood sugar steady and adding some saturated fat helps. Saturated fats inhibit the stress hormones, which means they also tend to inhibit the release of fat from stores. Sugar, saturated fats, niacin, and aspirin inhibit the release of fat.

One of the ways the body safely eliminates stored PUFA is through the liver. The liver recognizes the PUFA as toxins and will selectively attach glucuronic acid to them, just as if it was dioxin, and send it to the kidneys for excretion. That's the safe way to get rid of it.

**Josh Rubin:** Can high blood pressure be looked at as an adaptation to stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When your body senses it's not getting enough oxygen or glucose, it tells the heart to pump more blood. But when you're loaded with PUFA, they give chronic signals to the brain that nothing is getting the glucose and oxygen it needs.

## Salt, Pregnancy, and Eclampsia

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about the benefits of salt, especially for pregnant women and eclampsia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The eclampsia problem is closely connected to high PUFA, low thyroid, low carbon dioxide, and poor ability to retain sodium. As sodium is lost, the adrenals try to correct things by increasing aldosterone. Aldosterone retains sodium but at the expense of losing magnesium faster.

If you just increase your sodium intake, you're compensating for low thyroid function, but you're turning off the aldosterone. Getting the aldosterone down directly lowers inflammation and stops some of the magnesium loss.

**Josh Rubin:** How does albumin play into that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen interferes with the liver's synthesis of albumin. If you're producing less albumin and have more unsaturated fats, the albumin becomes saturated with fats. When albumin is loaded with fats, it passes right through the kidneys into the urine.

Albumin's function is to retain water in association with sodium. If your albumin is low, you get water retention problems. The first thing that happens when you correct your fats, thyroid, and estrogen is that you let water out of the body while retaining the sodium, magnesium, and albumin.

## Heavy Metal Detox and Carrots

**Josh Rubin:** Caller from the 415, you're on the air.

**Caller (415):** What do you think of heavy metal detox? If you get amalgams out, do you need IV glutathione or vitamin C drips?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hans Selye did experiments poisoning animals with mercury. He showed that a given dose would cause death, but if he gave them the same amount of mercury plus vitamin C, they had no toxic effects.

Mercury in its reduced form isn't toxic. It's like iron. Caffeine is associated with getting heavy metals out of tissues. Vitamin C from regular foods is an important defense. But if you take reducing agents like glutathione in an unphysiological way (IV), they can activate iron. Glutathione is the agent of making iron toxic. If you put glutathione into the blood, it can increase free radical damage.

**Josh Rubin:** Caller from the 386.

**Caller (Debbie):** Is there an advantage to shredding the carrot versus eating it whole?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been experiments with the length of fiber. If you put a carrot in a blender, you're destroying a lot of the water-retaining function of the fibers. Your teeth leave large sections of the fiber intact. Just chewing it is very good.

## Fertility, Sleep, and Dental Health

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding male fertility: if someone has low sperm count, what can they do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid is probably the main cause of both male and female infertility. In the 1940s, people saw that pregnenolone alone was enough to greatly increase sperm quality. Polyunsaturated fats are a major villain in male fertility.

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding sleep: people follow your principles but have trouble sleeping or wake up with a high pulse. Why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Taking too much thyroid too soon can do that. Your liver should store enough glycogen to let you fast for eight hours. Before the liver has regenerated its ability to store glycogen, the thyroid makes your brain and muscles need more sugar. You have to eat more often until your liver adapts. Having some fat with your carbohydrate makes it absorb more slowly. Salt is also very effective at lowering adrenaline.

**Josh Rubin:** Caller from the 718.

**Caller (718):** I started taking pure fructose and felt great, but recently started having sleep problems. I switched to starch and my sleep normalized.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the starch is getting digested and assimilated more slowly. Eating fiber and fat with your carbohydrate will extend the absorption. Sugar is absorbed quickly in the upper intestine. Starch, if it's slow to break down, can feed bacteria lower in the intestine and cause inflammation. The combination of fat and fiber might be a way to make your blood sugar steadier.

**Josh Rubin:** Question about dental health. Some recommend eliminating fruit, but you talk about carbohydrates.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a recent article on dental health in Sweden. During the time that cavities decreased radically, sugar and candy consumption had actually increased. Old studies showed that increased estrogen increased dental decay, and increased thyroid reduced it. Stress will very quickly cause an outbreak of cavities. Mainline dentistry completely neglects the chemical and immunological function of saliva. I think saliva is a mediator of stress.

## Fasting, Longevity, and Cell Phones

**Josh Rubin:** What are your thoughts on fasting to upregulate autophagy to starve off diseases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Activating your metabolism is going to eat up proteins that shouldn't be there. One of the main things interfering with the breakdown of protein is the PUFA. Accumulating long-chain unsaturated fatty acids with aging changes the way the cell functions at the deepest levels.

**Josh Rubin:** What about carb restriction for longevity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the short range, fasting will reduce endotoxin absorption. But dropping your carbohydrate intake will raise your cortisol production. People feel better initially because cortisol produces a sort of anesthetic euphoria. But in the long run, it's stressful to turn protein into the carbohydrate your brain needs.

**Josh Rubin:** Are cell phones really unhealthy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Microwaves are a threat. There have been experiments for over 50 years showing biological effects from even moderately weak fields. The standard medical doctrine relies on the cell membrane theory—that a cell needs a barrier to seal in chemicals. They believe radiation must heat the chemicals to cause damage.

But in the cell, there is no such barrier membrane. The whole cell is highly organized and responds to very low levels of electromagnetic energy.

## Thyroid Glandulars and Minerals

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend thyroid glandulars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If a person's cholesterol is down around 100, they are very fragile. You have to get cholesterol up to at least 160 before increasing metabolic rate.

Traditional thyroid glands (like in fish head soup) consisted of about three parts T4 to one part T3. As the liver gets energy (glucose), it converts T4 to T3. If you don't have sugar and take your glandular, you only experience about 25% of the potential effect.

The glandular is safer because it lets your liver handle your physiology. If you try to take just T3, your TSH goes down. If you don't take T3 during the night, TSH revs up and turns on inflammatory processes.

The trouble is the technology of making a glandular product seems to have been lost. Armour was making their traditional product for 90 years, but then Revlon bought it and decided to extract calcitonin. So the new glandular is no longer what it used to be.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about the roles of magnesium and calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your thyroid is low and you don't produce ATP fast enough, the cell doesn't have the main thing that binds magnesium intracellularly, so it gets lost in the urine. Thyroid status is the main thing that determines how much magnesium you need.

You can't talk about the ideal ratio of minerals in the abstract. William Frederick Koch found that he could cure muscle spasms from parathyroid removal with any of the minerals—calcium, potassium, sodium, or magnesium. It's a matter of having a total of these alkaline minerals.

A lot of Americans get seven times as much phosphate as calcium. One of the functions of fructose is to make you lose phosphate faster, improving the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. The ratio in milk (1.3 to 1) is very safe.

## Vitamin E and Cell Membranes

**Josh Rubin:** Any final thoughts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E has undergone radical changes. When ADM bought the old distillation factory, they changed the methods. Old vitamin E research showed beneficial effects, but recent research shows ineffectiveness.

Wheat germ oil was a common starting material, rich in long-chain saturated alcohols like octacosanol. I suspect the original vitamin E research might have been effective because of these saturated fats neutralizing the PUFA, similar to how cocoa butter protects against canola oil damage.

**Josh Rubin:** Last caller from Washington.

**Caller (Justin):** I was reading about how Mexican children didn't get polio and its correlation to diet. Do you have comments on vaccinations or the infectious disease model?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect the Mexican immigrants were immune to childhood infectious diseases just because of their relative iron deficiency. Also, traditional tortillas are very high in calcium because they boil the corn in lime. That has an undoubted anti-stress effect.

**Josh Rubin:** One last question emailed in: What do you feel about research regarding cell membrane signaling?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very good business because they can sell anything if they say it's working on signals via the cell membrane. But basically, the membrane is not very relevant to actual cell physiology.

People in the 1930s showed large molecules like albumin entering cells freely. Fritiof Sjöstrand, who was a professor at UCLA and editor of the *Journal of Ultrastructure Research*, did work that is completely incompatible with the popular doctrine of plasma membranes.

**Josh Rubin:** Thank you, Ray, for this great show.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
