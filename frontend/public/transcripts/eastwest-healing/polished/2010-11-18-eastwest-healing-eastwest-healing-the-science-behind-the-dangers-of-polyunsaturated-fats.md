## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Hey everyone, this is Josh Rubin and Jeannie from Holistic Living. Today we are talking to Dr. Raymond Peat. He is a researcher, an educator, and an artist. A lot of what he teaches and preaches definitely goes against the grain.

**Jeannie Rubin:** Thanks for joining us today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Josh Rubin:** Today we're going to be talking about polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). You have obviously done way more research on this subject than most people. It's quite a controversial topic because a lot of people are promoting taking these oils or eating these foods. We have studied you for years, and it is definitely brain-twisting for a lot of people. Can you give a brief introduction to who you are and why you do what you do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started studying brain physiology in 1968 when I went to the University of Oregon. I found that the best scientists were working in reproductive physiology. Even though the brain was my center of interest, I did my PhD work on reproductive physiology, particularly female aging, studying the effects of estrogen and the changes with aging.

I thought that the old animals actually had more estrogen stimulation in their tissues than younger animals, and it was working basically like contraceptive pills to prevent fertility after middle age. I noticed that the uteruses under the influence of aging and estrogen typically were darkened and contained a brown pigment. That got me interested in how that pigment develops through aging.

Estrogen excess, radiation, or deprivation of oxygen can cause it. I started studying this pigment, which is called lipofuscin, or age pigment. It had been studied quite a lot in the 1930s and 40s. They found that they were killing their animals by feeding them too much of the seeds that were rich in polyunsaturated fats.

## The Toxicity of Polyunsaturated Fats

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Animals like mink, which are carnivorous, were being killed by an excess of fish in the diet. Even horse meat was killing animals like mink; if the horses had eaten flax or linseed, their fat was toxic to the carnivorous animals.

Animals that ate too much of the unsaturated fats developed "yellow fat disease." In mink, it developed paralysis of the hindquarters fairly quickly and then killed them. Their fat tissue was inflamed, waterlogged, and eventually turned yellow or brown. That is the same pigment that appears in the uterus that has been overexposed to estrogen, or in the skin of an old person that has been exposed to sunlight.

All the organs develop this pigment with aging, but it develops in proportion to the amount of unsaturated fats in the diet. The essential toxic effect is that it consumes oxygen even faster than the unsaturated fatty acids. It acts as an enzyme equivalent, directly wasting energy and oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide and a variety of toxic effects.

It also poisons the respiratory enzymes and the cellular cleanup systems—the proteolytic enzymes that should remove defective proteins. This is seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. They accumulate a lot of these highly unsaturated oils, such as EPA and DHA. In the process, these fats inactivate the enzymes which should remove toxic proteins.

**Josh Rubin:** Let's rewind a little so people understand. Our diets consist of proteins, carbs, and fats. Can you explain the role of these in the body before we go deeper into PUFAs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The basic structure of the body is built of proteins. The function of the protein is partly to produce energy and to replicate itself. We have to eat protein constantly.

Regarding fats, we can synthesize our own saturated and unsaturated fats. When we synthesize the highly unsaturated fats ourselves from eating either sugar or protein, the longer unsaturated fats are called Mead acid. Sugars are able to produce energy, making it unnecessary to convert protein to energy. But in the absence of sugar or fat, we can easily convert protein into fat and sugar to produce energy.

## The History of the "Healthy Fat" Misconception

**Josh Rubin:** Why do you think there is such a misconception about healthy versus non-healthy fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The misconception started very quickly in the 1940s when agricultural chemists found that they could fatten their animals faster if they poisoned their metabolic systems with an antithyroid drug. They would get fat on very little food. However, that turned out to leave a carcinogenic residue in the meat.

They then found that corn and soybeans contained these polyunsaturated fats that would suppress the respiration of the animals and make them get fat on very little food. But in the process, they found that they were getting yellow fat disease, brain degeneration, degeneration of the gonads, infertility, and so on.

The function of Vitamin E in the 1930s had been identified as an anti-estrogen. Researchers saw a connection between excess estrogen and excess polyunsaturated fats. However, as the agricultural industry turned to the very fattening diet of high polyunsaturated oil foods (corn and soybeans), they needed to protect against the toxic effects killing their animals. They used Vitamin E. So, Vitamin E became known as an antioxidant rather than an anti-estrogen.

Medical people noticed that cholesterol was lowered in the process of eating a lot of these polyunsaturated fats. That led to the marketing of unsaturated fats to the human food supply. Since people didn't want to gain weight on the least amount of food, they needed a new reason for selling their fats to humans. Lowering cholesterol became the excuse.

**Josh Rubin:** Nowadays, what are the fats in the current diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People are still talking about "essential fatty acids" as if they were almost a vitamin. When I was a kid in school, nutritionists would say "possibly essential" or mention a controversy.

In 1929, the Burrs (researchers working for the agricultural industry) claimed that linoleic acid and linolenic acid were essential nutrients. Previously, researchers had demonstrated that animals could live perfectly without those if they were given vitamin-rich, protein-rich food. In fact, some German researchers found that animals didn't develop cancer—something like 99% of cancers didn't develop—when animals were deprived of linoleic and linolenic acids.

The Burrs ignored the evidence that these fats are not essential. They produced skin disease and gonadal defects when they deprived the animals of these two fatty acids. However, at that time, only two of the B vitamins were known. About three years later, researchers found that Vitamin B6 deficiency causes exactly the symptoms that were blamed on the linoleic acid deficiency.

They fed their animals the diet that the Burrs had used and created the symptoms. Then they gave the animals only extra Vitamin B6 and cured the condition. What the Burrs had demonstrated was that the essential fatty acids slow metabolism, making the animals need less food, thus preventing a deficiency on a deficient diet. But the oil industry simply ignored the fact that the Burrs' work had been invalidated.

## Sources of Polyunsaturated Fats

**Jeannie Rubin:** Besides Omega 3 (linolenic) and Omega 6 (linoleic), where else in our food supply do we consume these polyunsaturated fatty acids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All natural foods contain small amounts. Coconut oil contains about 1%. Beef, lamb, milk, and cheese contain a couple of percent, depending on what the animal ate.

The really risky sources appear when you get above the equivalent of about a teaspoonful of polyunsaturated fats per day (4 grams). That is where the breakdown of these starts showing an increased incidence of cancer and other degenerative diseases.

The foods richest in these unstable and potentially toxic oils are grains, seeds, nuts, vegetables in general, and all of the animals which are not ruminants that have eaten vegetable polyunsaturated fats. Horses, rabbits, chickens, and pigs will reflect in their diet pretty exactly what they've been eating. Fish eat algae and smaller organisms that have eaten algae, so they get a very high concentration of these polyunsaturated fats.

**Josh Rubin:** People are overdoing seeds and nuts. Can you explain why the seeds of plants produce these polyunsaturated fatty acids? And when you say vegetables, are you talking above ground or below ground?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you think of where corn or soybeans normally grow, the seed sits on the ground through the winter. It is basically kept in refrigeration. When it warms up, it sprouts. The seed contains enough Vitamin E that under this refrigerated situation, the polyunsaturated fats are stable.

If the oils were completely saturated, they would be like butter in the refrigerator—hard and immobile. The unsaturated fats are still liquid and mobile at refrigerator temperatures. The unsaturation is a defense to maintain mobility on the molecular level at low temperatures.

However, if you kept the seed warm all winter at the temperature of a human body, these oils would react with oxygen and the seed would be dead by springtime. In your body at 98 degrees, that oxidation happens even faster than at room temperature.

**Josh Rubin:** Would you say you are more in favor of vegetables like squashes or root vegetables that have very little polyunsaturated fatty acids, rather than greens, spinach, and kale?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The leaves are important sources of magnesium and Vitamin K, but you have to take into consideration the high proportion of polyunsaturated fats. For calories, squashes and root vegetables are safer. Fruits are even better because the tissue contains a higher concentration of minerals than starchy vegetables. Potatoes are more like a fruit or an animal protein in their total nutritional value.

## Inflammation and Omega 3s

**Jeannie Rubin:** Many people think Omega 3s produce non-inflammatory prostaglandins. Do we need essential fatty acids to fight inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some recent work on the anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil (Omega-3) shows that they accumulate with aging. Alzheimer's or dementia patients have a much higher level of these in the brain. They spontaneously oxidize into toxic, anti-metabolic substances—neuroprostanes—and in the process of oxidizing, they suppress the immune system.

When you suppress the cells that produce inflammation, you get an interruption of an existing inflammatory process. However, researchers have found that it is only the oxidized, broken-down form of the fish oil that has this effect. When you prolong the feeding, you start seeing that immunodepression is the long-range result.

The present advocacy of fish oil for its anti-inflammatory effect is very similar to what the X-ray industry was doing 80 years ago. They treated arthritis, acne, and psoriasis with X-rays because the immediate effect is to create lipid peroxides, which are anti-inflammatory immediately, but immunosuppressive and toxic in the long run.

## Dietary Solutions and Saturated Fats

**Josh Rubin:** Can you give us five key points on why PUFAs are dangerous and some alternative fats that are beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
1.  **Olive Oil:** Pretty safe because it has a variety of antioxidants, even though it is 10% PUFA. I recommend not eating more than a couple of teaspoonfuls per day.
2.  **Coconut Oil:** Has only around 1% or 2% polyunsaturated fats. Coconut oil and butter can actually have an antioxidant effect, blocking the effects of the breakdown products of PUFAs.
3.  **Sugar/Fruit:** Sugar is naturally turned into saturated fats. We immediately create an Omega-9 type of fat (Mead acid) when we synthesize fat from sugar.
4.  **Mead Acid:** These are produced from saturated fats and have an anti-inflammatory effect. By avoiding the toxic anti-inflammatory effects of PUFAs, we allow our body to produce the natural anti-inflammatory Mead acid series.
5.  **Saturated Fats:** We can produce protective fats from saturated fats such as cocoa butter (stearic acid).

**Josh Rubin:** You mention that PUFAs store in the tissues and, during stress or low glucose, can create hormonal or hypothyroid symptoms. Can you elaborate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen favors the storage of polyunsaturated fats, and these fats favor the influence of estrogen.

When a mammal is born, the tissues are "deficient" in essential fatty acids by present standards because of the presence of Mead acid. The growth of the fetus is inhibited when you try to "correct" that deficiency by feeding the mother seed oils or fish oils.

35 years ago, experimenters fed pregnant animals diets with corn oil versus coconut oil. They found that the unsaturated fats caused the pregnant animals to have small-brained babies which didn't learn very well. Recently, French researchers tried to demonstrate that pregnant women eating unsaturated fats had smarter babies. In fact, they found the opposite: the babies were less able to learn in proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet, and they were born smaller with smaller brains.

**Jeannie Rubin:** Do you feel that eliminating PUFAs and increasing saturated fats could reverse hormonal imbalances and hypothyroidism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 20 years ago, I decided to experiment by adding half an ounce to an ounce of coconut oil to my food. The immediate thing I noticed was that for about an hour and a half after eating it, my heart was running at a higher rate, I was breathing harder, and my skin was pinker. After a couple of weeks, I saw I was losing weight quickly, even though I was eating more calories.

Constantly, when we draw on stored unsaturated fats, all functions of our thyroid system are inhibited. We produce less hormone, transport it less effectively, and it enters the mitochondria less effectively. If you interrupt that supply of stored unsaturated fats, you immediately feel a surge of respiratory activity.

Conversely, the immediate effect of the presence of unsaturated fats is to block the oxidation of glucose. This is called the **Randle Cycle**. It immediately impairs the ability to oxidize glucose, leading to diabetes-like issues and oxidative damage to the mitochondria.

## Summary and Listener Questions

**Josh Rubin:** Can you summarize why you dislike PUFAs in vegetables and cod liver oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
*   It promotes estrogen's effect.
*   It interferes with the synthesis of progesterone and other protective steroids.
*   It inhibits the thyroid.
*   It promotes the accumulation of age pigment (lipofuscin).
*   It makes you more sensitive to radiation exposure.
*   While fish oil is marketed for health, in Japan, the amount of fish in the diet corresponds to several types of cancer, including metastatic cancers.

**Josh Rubin:** Let's take a call.

**Caller 1:** I follow metabolic typing and I am a "protein type," so I can't get many fats other than from meat. If nuts aren't good for us, how do I get the recommended amount of fat? I take coconut oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tropical foods in general are pretty safe. The nuts that grow at a very high temperature are, like coconuts, very saturated in their fats. Tropical fruits are also good because the small amount of fats in those are highly saturated. Anything that lives or grows at a high temperature is going to be safe when it gets in our body at that same high temperature.

**Josh Rubin:** Let's take one more caller.

**Caller 2:** I was curious about polyunsaturated fats and temperature. How do bears do it? They get a ton of PUFAs and they are at 98 degrees.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bears eat berries to fatten up in the fall. During hibernation, their body temperature drops quite a bit. With squirrels and other hibernators, they have seen that if they don't let them eat the PUFA nuts—if they give them a saturated diet—they don't hibernate. The serotonin that triggers hibernation comes up when you reach a certain point of unsaturation in your fats.

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, we have to wrap it up. Thank you for taking the time to come on our show. We really value your work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
