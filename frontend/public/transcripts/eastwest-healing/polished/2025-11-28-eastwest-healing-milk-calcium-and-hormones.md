## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome everyone. This is Josh Rubin from East West Healing and Performance. Jeannie and Ray will be joining us in a couple of minutes. It's been a little bit of trouble getting Ray back on, but I think the break was good and we have a good show ahead of us on milk, calcium, and hormones.

Ray Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon. He specializes in physiology and has taught at many schools around the U.S. and Mexico. He actually started his work with progesterone-related hormones back in 1968. As you know from reading his articles and books, he is a humble genius. You can learn more about him at raypeat.com.

Today’s show is on milk, calcium, and hormones. We’re going to be talking about dairy, the degradation of it, where it comes from, and why Ray recommends so much of it. We will talk about calcium, blood labs, parathyroid hormone, and how to regulate those levels to down-regulate inflammation.

## Milk, Strontium-90, and Fallout

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, I guess we need to rewind a little bit. There are so many people out there that say, "Stay away from milk, we're not cows." Others say, "Only drink raw milk." Why do you think there is so much degradation of milk itself, and why are we seeing so many allergies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been interested in milk for a long time, probably 55 years or so. I've been studying the cultural antagonisms. In the 1950s, the government had been collecting samples of organisms from around the world to monitor the effects of the atom bomb tests. They wanted to know how it was accumulating in young people, so they started collecting baby teeth. The isotope that concentrated most in teeth happened to be Strontium-90.

After they had been doing that for years, it came out that Strontium-90 was causing leukemia in children, among other cancers. When that got into the news, people said, "Well, baby teeth show the radioactive isotope which is similar to calcium, and milk is rich in calcium. Milk is probably the main place babies are getting their Strontium-90." A whole wave went through the culture advising people not to drink milk.

However, already in 1956 or 1957, people had analyzed the composition of diets. They found that the fallout into the soil produced a high ratio of Strontium-90 to available calcium. Plants extracted the calcium, since that was what their cells needed, but left behind a good proportion of the strontium. When cows ate the vegetation, they again extracted a high proportion of calcium and filtered out a lot of strontium.

So, when you add it up, if you get your essential nutrients from vegetable matter rather than milk, you're getting extremely high concentrations of the fallout isotopes. Milk is a good filtering process to eliminate all kinds of contaminants. Especially in a period of high radiation, it filters out the radioactive isotopes.

## Milk Quality and Allergies

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The United States cleaned up the commercial dairy industry 40 or 50 years ago, cutting out the use of the most dangerous insecticides that were known to cause breast cancer. In the 60s, the EPA and FDA banned the use of these insecticides around cows and dairies. Israel was slower to ban one of these insecticides, but when they did, their breast cancer rate plunged. The U.S. has been leading the world in cleaning up the milk supply, far ahead of cleaning up the meat supply. Dairy is still probably the cleanest food available.

**Josh Rubin:** In your milk article, you talked about plants producing enzymes when stressed. How do you pronounce it? Chitinases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chitinase. That's a plant enzyme that is protective against insects, but it is strongly allergenic to any animal. In small amounts, it's produced in a stressed animal under the influence of estrogen. It's possible that is a factor in meat, eggs, and milk, but probably not in a practical sense.

The main allergens that get into the milk come from cows grazing on pastures that have allergenic weeds. That will go right into the milk. You can usually taste the funny food in the milk. Some small dairies aren't very alert to what their cows are eating, and that can cause an individual dairy's milk to be more allergenic than average.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about the validity of food intolerance labs regarding dairy? I know you talk about how having a damaged metabolism or blood sugar issues can create the mechanism in the GI system to create the intolerance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tests for allergens are really just a vague indicator that your immune system reacts to everything you are exposed to. Usually, finding antibodies to a particular substance means that you have become tolerant to that substance. I don't pay any attention to the lab tests for allergies.

The intestine adjusts its enzymes within just a few weeks. Until your intestine has adjusted its enzymes to a new kind of diet, much of that food is going to be undigested, and it will feed bacteria rather than feeding the person. The strange new growth of bacteria will produce chemicals that can be toxic and allergenic. Much of the food sensitivity issue is just failing to adapt because they change diets too suddenly.

**Jeannie Rubin:** So you're saying when somebody introduces milk back into the diet, take it very slow to allow the body to adapt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even if a person has lactose intolerance from a lactase deficiency, tests have found that if they drink a cup per meal or less, they don't have the diarrhea produced by drinking a pint on an empty stomach. Even if biopsies show a deficiency of the lactase enzyme, that can be induced in about two weeks just by introducing an occasional small amount of milk. The cells sense the presence of a nutrient and the enzymes are gradually induced.

Bacterial infections and inflammation can cause the loss of lactase enzymes. Experiments with supplementing thyroid or progesterone have found that you can induce or restore the lactase that has been deficient just by increasing those anti-stress hormones.

**Josh Rubin:** Does that have to do with their effect on increasing metabolism, regulating blood sugar, and down-regulating estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Inflammation is probably the basic problem there. Thyroid and progesterone, by restoring energy and normal function, bypass the inflammatory processes. Inflammation shifts the cell function to an emergency state, and you tend to lose a lot of functional enzymes in an inflamed state.

## The Benefits of Milk

**Josh Rubin:** Why do you feel dairy is so important?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The biggest part is probably the alternatives. In 1960, the focus against milk was Strontium-90, but it turned out milk was the best food for *avoiding* Strontium-90. It's the same with industrial additives and accidental pollutants. Just about every place you look in the food industry, things are far worse than milk. Some fruits, like bananas, are one of the worst products for chemical use. But if you can find unstressed fruits, those are very free of toxins relative to most other food products.

**Josh Rubin:** It would be safe to say dairy is like a complete macronutrient—carb, protein, fat—and very balanced regarding blood sugar and inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it even contains some testosterone. Thyroid, progesterone, and testosterone are important for the young animal. In human milk, they found enough thyroid hormone that babies whose thyroids were destroyed by living near Three Mile Island during the accident didn't suffer symptoms of hypothyroidism as long as they were being breastfed.

## Calcium and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)

**Jeannie Rubin:** Can you elaborate on how calcium and the parathyroid work together in assisting the body with chronic stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's a subject for a week of seminars. Calcium is potentially the thing that causes all of the problems—allergies, cancer, heart attacks—but when calcium is regulated properly, it protects against all of those things.

One of the central things in regulating calcium is parathyroid hormone (PTH). When you are deficient in calcium in your foods, your PTH increases. It keeps your blood calcium up to the proper level, but it does that by taking it out of the bones. When you eat an excess of calcium, that tends to suppress the PTH.

Since they've been doing dialysis for kidney disease, they found that if they remove the parathyroid gland entirely, they can solve many of the deadly effects of chronic kidney dialysis, such as hypertension and insomnia. When you look at the effects of PTH excess in dialysis patients, you get an idea of the range of things that eating extra calcium can correct by suppressing the hormone. Insomnia is just one of them. Probably everywhere calcium is involved in an excitatory, inflammation-promoting way, you can reverse it just by increasing the calcium in your diet.

Two vitamins are important for making the tissue handle calcium properly and lowering PTH: Vitamin K and Vitamin D. Other nutrients, like Vitamin A and niacinamide, work in the same direction, helping to balance the ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

**Josh Rubin:** There are so many people listening who think because their lab results say their calcium levels are low, they need to pump calcium. But you're saying we need to down-regulate PTH first. Can you take too much calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I often see people with a blood calcium of 11, 12, or 13 (when it should be 9 or 10). By getting them to eat *more* calcium, and maybe take Vitamin D and K, they can very quickly get their calcium down to normal. The reason it is high is generally because they are eating too much phosphate and over-driving their parathyroid hormone.

**Josh Rubin:** Could eating a lot of muscle meats and tryptophan facilitate PTH?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, many things increase the parathyroid. Serotonin has a direct action. Estrogen, cortisol, and prolactin all have promoting effects on PTH. Progesterone and thyroid are the main things that help to inhibit it.

Part of that mechanism is carbon dioxide (CO2). As CO2 is produced in the cell and flows out, it forces calcium to leave the cell. That relaxes the cell, because calcium should be outside the cell. When it's inside, it tends to excite the cell and cause inflammation and lactic acid production. PTH activates glycolysis and the formation of lactic acid. That's a big part of how it dissolves the bone to provide more calcium for the bloodstream.

Everything that shifts the balance away from lactic acid production and towards carbon dioxide production helps get the calcium back into the bloodstream and back into the bones.

**Josh Rubin:** Can we use things like baking soda or carbonated water to facilitate that process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The exchange between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide is so quick that when you give a person a dose of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), the exchange is quick at the cell surface of a stressed cell. You can restore a stressed cell with baking soda because the sodium will quickly get lost out the urine, leaving the body acidified with the intracellular carbon dioxide, which puts the cell back into its anti-inflammatory resting state.

## Raw vs. Pasteurized Milk and Yogurt

**Josh Rubin:** You talk about how some people can't handle raw milk, and you actually recommend pasteurized for them. Why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every cow has its particular balance of bacteria. A healthy cow will have a very high bacteria count in its milk, and the individual cow will change its bacterial balance according to what it's eating and the season. If a person has a bad reaction to some of the bacteria they're getting from the cow, simply trying a different dairy might work.

I know a few people who get gas or diarrhea from most supermarket milks, but if they drink only the ultra-pasteurized milk, they tolerate that nicely. Ultra-pasteurized milk has somewhat lower vitamin content and doesn't taste as good, but some people do tolerate it better.

**Josh Rubin:** What about yogurts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first concern is to make sure it doesn't contain carrageenan and gums. Those are showing up in more foods, even roast beef. Carrageenan is a sulfated polysaccharide, similar to our own connective tissue breakdown material. It can cause acute immune reactions and is used experimentally to cause inflammation in research.

If it says it's just fermented milk yogurt, that's the safest kind. Still, it's better not to eat more than a few spoonfuls per day because any lactic acid is extra work for your liver. The liver has to consume glucose to turn lactic acid back into glucose, so it is a drain on your blood sugar reserves.

## Saturated Fats and Iron

**Josh Rubin:** Why are the saturated fats in dairy important?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A liver disease research group led by A.A. Nanji demonstrated a curative effect on hepatitis and cirrhosis from adding saturated fats—from coconut oil through butter fats. Similarly, they showed that fish oils and seed oils (polyunsaturated) exacerbate liver diseases. The breakdown products of unsaturated fats produce inflammatory diseases. Just by substituting saturated fats, you have an anti-inflammatory effect.

**Josh Rubin:** Dairy is also low in iron, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. During pregnancy, the mother's estrogen causes the intestine to absorb more iron. The fetus is in a situation of low oxygen tension, so it accumulates iron. The fetus is born overcharged with iron and typically doesn't need to eat any iron for about six months to a year. Milk is designed to let the baby grow into its potentially toxic overcharge of iron.

Men, by the time they're 50, are generally overloaded with iron, which contributes to free radical oxidation and heart disease. Women are protected as long as they are menstruating. Milk and cheese are foods deficient in iron, so adding them helps prevent that chronic tendency to overcharge.

## Cheese, Whey, and Weight Loss

**Josh Rubin:** What about cheeses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Recently, I saw an advertisement stating that over 60% of cheeses now made use commercial cultures from bacteria and fungus as cheap substitutes for traditional methods. Almost all commercial cheeses are now risky because of those microorganisms, besides any additives for texture.

**Josh Rubin:** What about whey protein powders?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 40 or 50 years ago, dairies would give fresh liquid whey to hog farmers. It produced healthy pigs. But when it is dehydrated into a powder, the process oxidizes the fragile amino acids, including tryptophan and cysteine. This increases toxicity and allergenicity.

Also, the casein in cheese is anti-inflammatory and anti-stress. You get the opposite effect from the whey fraction. Whey is easily degraded, lacks the anti-stress factors, and is deficient in calcium.

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of people say milk makes them fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All the research on animals, and as far as it goes with humans, shows that milk is probably the best reducing food there is. The calcium inhibits the fat-forming enzyme, fatty acid synthase. At the same time, it activates the uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria, which burn calories faster. Milk is the only food I know that does both of those things simultaneously.

## Osteoporosis and Eggshell Calcium

**Josh Rubin:** Can a high protein diet, or a diet low in carb or fat, create overstimulation of parathyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because most protein comes with lots of phosphate. Grains, beans, and meats are high in phosphate. The ratio between phosphate and calcium is the main thing that activates the parathyroid hormone.

**Josh Rubin:** What about osteoporosis? Does estrogen play a part?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Parathyroid hormone increases with the menstrual cycle when estrogen is dominant. Estrogen, prolactin, serotonin, and cortisol all dissolve bones. It's interesting that they promote estrogen as a bone strengthener, yet in the 50 or 60 years women have been taught to use estrogen, the rate of breaking hips has increased.

**Josh Rubin:** What are some other nutritional sources of calcium besides dairy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eggshells. If you boil your eggs to get any additives off, eggshells are the purest form of calcium carbonate. It is probably the ideal form to use as a supplement.

**Josh Rubin:** How would you recommend ingesting them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pulverize them into a powder and take a fourth to a half teaspoon if a person is not getting their milk calcium.

## Caller Q&A

### Fluoride

**Caller (520):** I haven't seen anything about fluoride on your site. Where is fluoride on your radar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I avoid fluoridated water carefully. During a stay in San Francisco, I wasn't aware the water was fluoridated and I started getting extreme hypothyroid symptoms. The water had enough fluoride to totally destroy the thyroid supplement I was taking. It just takes one fluoride atom to ruin the T3 molecule. It is a thyroid toxin. Also, studies have shown that fluoridated populations have a higher cancer rate.

### Acne and Dairy

**Caller (360):** I've noticed an increase in acne every time I ingest dairy. What are your thoughts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dairy increases your metabolic rate. Calcium is a powerful stimulant to metabolism. The increased metabolic rate makes you consume Vitamin A and probably several other nutrients. Vitamin A is usually the limiting nutrient. People who do anything that increases their metabolic rate often find they need more Vitamin A. If you increase Vitamin A, you can often prevent the acne.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend plant or animal sources for Vitamin A?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Plant sources (carotenes) aren't really Vitamin A. They depend on Vitamin B12 and thyroid function to be converted. If you overload on carotenes, they can have an anti-thyroid action. I recommend liver (once a week), eggs, and milk.

### Phosphate in Milk

**Caller (617):** A lot of anti-milk articles argue that milk drains calcium from your bones because it has a higher phosphorus-to-calcium ratio than the human body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the ratio in milk is very high towards calcium. Even if you are eating meat (high phosphate), drinking a good amount of milk will put those phosphates into proportion. Milk is, next to eggshells, our best source of calcium.

### Trans Fats in Dairy

**Caller (111):** Is there a difference between natural trans fats in dairy and synthetic ones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you heard of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)? It has therapeutic benefits—anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity. CLA is a natural component of milk fat. The trans fats in dairy are just in process on the way to forming CLA.

Bacteria in the cow's rumen detoxify the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) from the grass. In the process, they create small amounts of trans fats and CLA. I think there is good evidence showing that these natural trans fats have a protective effect and block the toxic effects of linoleic acid (PUFA).
