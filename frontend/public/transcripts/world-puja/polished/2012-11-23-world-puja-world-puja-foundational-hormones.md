## Introduction

**Taya Skerry:** Hello and welcome. This is Taya Skerry, your host of the *To Your Health* series broadcasting from the World Puja Network. I'm delighted to present engaging, in-depth conversations with leaders, researchers, and authors in the fields of advanced nutrition, biochemistry, emotional intelligence, energy-based medicine, and the mind-body connection. Every show is designed to give you practical bottom-line information to optimize your physical, emotional, and mental well-being.

With me today is Dr. Raymond Peat. Raymond is an author who has written *Nutrition for Women*, *Mind and Tissue*, *Progesterone in Orthomolecular Medicine*, and *Generative Energy*. He holds patents for progesterone in tocopherol, DHEA and other steroids for arthritis, and the use of steroids in the treatment of osteoporosis. He received his PhD in Biology, specializing in progesterone and related hormones, in 1972. I'm looking forward to digging into his brain to simplify some very complicated topics on foundational hormones. Raymond, hello.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hello.

**Taya Skerry:** How are you doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Taya Skerry:** You did your PhD because you really wanted to dedicate yourself to science and discover something new?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I’ve been studying interesting stuff, just trying to understand how the world works. I had specialized in linguistics, literature, painting, and things that I was interested in, but around the age of 30, I decided I should make knowledge useful. I decided that useful knowledge was really the purpose of the brain.

**Taya Skerry:** And you're now 73 and still pursuing knowledge?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. That's why I do a newsletter every two months; I'm still trying to get the big picture more sharply focused.

## Foundational Hormones and Light

**Taya Skerry:** I have read just about all your articles on your website. What really fascinated me were the foundational hormones: pregnenolone, progesterone, and estrogen. I find that people really need to understand these to see the bigger picture. Can you take us into the world of foundational hormones? Why do we need them and what are they?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been working in Mexico for several years, and when I moved back to the U.S., I started noticing the effects of the weather on my health, and especially on young women's health in the winter. At the university, lots of students would spend most of their time indoors and sometimes get no sun at all for several months. I started seeing symptoms like premenstrual syndrome and depression that came on in the winter in people who had never experienced those symptoms until they came to Eugene, Oregon, which is a very cloudy place in the winter.

I realized that sunlight is a major factor in allowing us to produce and use certain hormones. Progesterone is the main hormone needed for both brain development and fertility. The reason animals are fertile in the spring is that as the days get longer, the sunlight increases the anti-stress hormones. It is mainly progesterone that increases in the spring, causing the brain to function with greater variety and energy, and allowing fertility to be carried to completion.

**Taya Skerry:** So that would be Vitamin D?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is one of the factors in sunlight. Vitamin D allows us to absorb and use calcium, and calcium holds down some of the basic stress hormones that tend to put us into a torpid, hibernation state when it's too dark. The hormones that make people depressed and sick in the winter are the same hormones that allow animals in nature to go into torpor or hibernation when the days are short.

Progesterone is the main anti-stress hormone that is inhibited if we're deficient in either calcium or Vitamin D. When Vitamin D and calcium are not adequate, cells go into an excited, inefficient state and they have to be quieted and put into a torpor by various other hormones. Progesterone keeps us out of that state, but to do it, you need to have your calcium under control.

It isn't just Vitamin D that regulates calcium; it's the energy produced in the mitochondria under the influence of good hormones and good nutrition. The mitochondria produce energy that keeps calcium out of cells and in the bones where it should be. If the days are very long, even if you don't have Vitamin D, the light that penetrates into your tissues is mostly red and yellow light. That light happens to quench the free radicals that damage the mitochondria. So, it's basically a low-energy state caused by a deficiency of sunlight, Vitamin D, and/or calcium.

**Taya Skerry:** So we actually require the ultraviolet light from the sun to synthesize Vitamin D, is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and also the red light to quench free radicals produced by stress.

**Taya Skerry:** If we go out in the early morning or after 5:00 PM, we won't get enough ultraviolet light for Vitamin D synthesis, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, you're getting the anti-stress effect [from the red light]. If you get enough calcium and other nutrients, you can get along with an extremely low Vitamin D intake. They've done experiments with animals where they gave them a diet lacking Vitamin D and low in calcium, but when they gave them sugar rather than starch, simply the energy efficiency of the sugar allowed them to build strong bones and avoid rickets. It's much more complex than just taking Vitamin D; it's a whole balance of nutrients.

## Sugar vs. Starch

**Taya Skerry:** You talk about sugar or glucose versus starch. Some people don't know the difference. What do you mean by starch and sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a basic lab experiment physiology professors used to give students, you would feed a rat a huge gob of cornstarch mixed with water via a stomach tube—the equivalent of about a quart for a person. You were instructed to find how far the starch had moved in the digestive system after five minutes. In just ten minutes, the students would find no trace of starch. It had been totally dissolved, turned into sugar, and absorbed, even though it was a massive amount.

Starch is a chain of glucose molecules. If you eat a given amount of calories in the form of starch, what you get is an instantaneous blast of glucose. If you eat the same amount of energy in the form of sucrose—plain granulated sugar—the absorption is slower. The glucose stimulates insulin and tends to turn on fat production. Fructose [in sucrose] slightly inhibits the production of insulin and the blood sugar disturbing effect.

**Taya Skerry:** That's interesting because cornstarch is predominant in foods these days, often in the form of maltodextrin. I tell people not to take that because it causes a high blood sugar increase, gas, and flatulence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If starches are instantly absorbed, as in the rat experiment, they cause obesity. If they are mixed with other ingredients so they are more slowly absorbed, then they are fermented in the intestine. That type of slowly digested starch was found to cause animals to become fearful and aggressive because of a toxic effect produced by fermentation in the intestine.

**Taya Skerry:** That's a classic case of "we are what we eat." We often don't realize the effect food has on our moods and brain chemistry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar is needed for the liver to activate the thyroid hormone, which produces the energy that prevents stress and regulates minerals and growth. If someone tries to eat a low-carbohydrate diet, or if they eat only starches so that their blood sugar goes up and down very quickly, their thyroid doesn't function properly. Sugar is the essential ingredient for about 70% of our thyroid function, which involves the liver's activation of thyroxine (T4) into the active thyroid hormone (T3). Without the active thyroid hormone, none of the steroid hormones can be made. The adrenals, ovaries, and brain can't adequately produce the protective steroids.

## Cholesterol and Pregnenolone

**Taya Skerry:** Why do we need protective steroids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Steroids are a feature of all life. Cholesterol, for example, is known to be involved in the process of cell division and the expression of genetic information. Every function of life involves either cholesterol or one of the steroids made from cholesterol.

**Taya Skerry:** Very few people know about pregnenolone. I often mention it because it's probably the safest one to take to boost foundational hormones. As we live in a world of unavoidable stress, we probably need a boost of pregnenolone after age 40.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pregnenolone is the first hormone produced from cholesterol when our thyroid function is adequate.

**Taya Skerry:** And it is made from LDL, which is classified as the "bad" cholesterol, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Cholesterol has been injected into animals, and when they are being trained, they become more intelligent and learn more quickly when their cholesterol is higher. In the Framingham Heart Study, it was found that people over the age of 50 who don't have cholesterol above the average—above 200 mg/dL—have a much higher risk of becoming demented. Cholesterol is a very important brain chemical, but one of its main functions is that the brain can turn it into pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone in very large quantities. If you're limited in your ability to turn cholesterol into those hormones, taking pregnenolone bypasses that bottleneck. You can sometimes see a tremendous improvement in a person's ability to cope when they take just a little bit of pregnenolone.

**Taya Skerry:** If we avoid cholesterol and eggs, we are likely deficient. Most people are shocked when I suggest eating two to four eggs a day.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can make cholesterol if you have enough of all the other nutrients. I recommend drinking a quart or two of orange juice per day for a person who wants to bring their cholesterol up quickly. It's much more efficient than eating a dozen eggs.

**Taya Skerry:** I don't think eggs actually raise cholesterol as the media suggests. I think a high starch diet raises triglycerides faster. What other supplements support this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin A is the main cofactor for the thyroid to be able to turn cholesterol into those hormones.

**Taya Skerry:** And that's Vitamin A from animal sources?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the 1930s, one of the signs for diagnosing hypothyroidism was a progesterone deficiency. When women with high estrogen and low progesterone had their ovaries removed, the corpus luteum—which means "yellow body" and is where progesterone is synthesized—was found to be bright red. They had accumulated carotene in place of Vitamin A. Carotene at that high concentration competes for the enzymes that use Vitamin A, so it has an anti-Vitamin A function.

**Taya Skerry:** Unless people eat chicken livers or egg yolks, they probably aren't getting enough retinol (Vitamin A).

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If your metabolic rate is high, your Vitamin A requirement is very high because you will be producing large amounts of pregnenolone and progesterone, which uses up Vitamin A. Sometimes people notice that in bright sunny weather they get acne or dandruff. If they take a supplement of Vitamin A—while watching their thyroid, because Vitamin A can inhibit thyroid function—they are able to make the progesterone and pregnenolone needed to respond to the long summer days.

## DHEA: Dosage and Effects

**Taya Skerry:** You had some interesting experiences yourself implementing hormones like DHEA. I read that you grew one and a half inches at the age of 46?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I had grown up in Oregon, and the winters are pretty dark and stressful. I didn't know I was hypothyroid because I would eat over 10,000 calories per day working in the woods and didn't get fat. But when I tried taking thyroid, my metabolism decreased sharply. It increased my efficiency, likely by increasing my production of progesterone and pregnenolone.

That led to experiments where I tried taking hormones individually. Some doctor friends had noticed what they thought was a melanoma growing on me—it looked like an arrowhead, irregular and rapidly enlarging. A few days after I began taking DHEA, that thing flared up and within about three days was gone. Around the same time, my wisdom teeth, which had started to erupt at age 18 but stopped for 25 years, began rotating. In about a month, they were perfectly oriented vertically rather than submerged and sideways.

**Taya Skerry:** That's inspirational. You only recommend one to two milligrams a day, which is infinitesimal compared to most supplements that start at 12, 25, or 50 milligrams.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Teenage boys only make about 12 milligrams per day at the maximum. So if you take 10 milligrams when you're 30 or 40, some of it is likely to be turned into estrogen.

**Taya Skerry:** If people buy 25mg over the counter, should they cut it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they should cut the tablets into fractions so they're only taking 2 to 5 milligrams per day.

**Taya Skerry:** Do you have a preferred way to take it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I used to sell DHEA dissolved in Vitamin E. This makes it very quick-acting and controllable; it circulates and distributes without affecting your liver. If you take it in crystalline powdered form, your liver gets the first opportunity to metabolize it, and that's when it most easily turns into estrogen. If it's dissolved completely in oil—like olive oil, coconut oil, or butter—it helps keep it from going into the liver first.

**Taya Skerry:** What if they just take pregnenolone and don't worry about DHEA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's best, I think. Several years ago I stopped giving people DHEA because they felt so good they would keep taking more and more until one person enlarged his liver and had the estrogen level of a teenage girl. I shifted to recommending almost everyone use pregnenolone instead. In animal experiments, rats given a massive dose of pure pregnenolone showed no change in hormones if they were happy and healthy. But if the rat was under stress, it lowered the stress hormones. So no matter how much you take, it doesn't disturb your hormones, but if you're under stress, it will remove the stress hormones.

**Taya Skerry:** Is there such a thing as taking too much pregnenolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For an experiment, I ate a kilogram of pregnenolone spread over a year. That averaged out to about 3,000 milligrams a day. I felt great. I could eat anything I wanted, and my metabolism was ideally regulated. The only reason I didn't keep it up was that it's very expensive.

## Diet, Coffee, and Minerals

**Taya Skerry:** How do you maintain your levels now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I use a small amount of a thyroid supplement, such as Cynomel (T3), and then I emphasize sodium, calcium, and sugary fruits in my diet. I try to get a lot of gelatin. By keeping the ratio of calcium to phosphorus very high and having a slight excess of sodium (table salt or baking soda), that helps regulate all the other minerals so you don't have to worry so much about magnesium. If you eat extra sodium, your body retains almost all the magnesium you give it.

**Taya Skerry:** Coffee is very high in magnesium, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's my main source of magnesium.

**Taya Skerry:** I read an article where you discussed how caffeine helps brain function and inhibits adenosine. Is it normal to have two or three cups a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It doesn't hurt to drink 50 if that balances your metabolism, but I think everyone should try to get three to five cups a day. Studies show that people who drank more than five cups had lower incidences of various kinds of cancer and dementia. Brain protection and avoidance of cancer are probably the two most important things coffee does.

**Taya Skerry:** Except it does raise cortisol levels. If one doesn't need raised cortisol, should they limit it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** By adjusting all your nutrients—getting lots of calcium from milk and cheese, and plenty of sugar from fruits—those things help hold down your cortisol. Eating small amounts at a time will reduce stress hormones too.

## Vegetarianism and Plant Toxins

**Taya Skerry:** If someone is a strict vegan, what do they need?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin A is the main problem because carotene can easily get in the way of Vitamin A functions. I saw a young man who was extremely sick; doctors found he had practically no Vitamin A in his blood but extremely high carotene, which was blocking his hormones. The carotene turns off thyroid function very powerfully. In his case, one dose of Vitamin B12 (needed to convert carotene to Vitamin A) cleared his symptoms within a week.

**Taya Skerry:** A lot of vegetarian diets lack B12. People think spirulina or spinach provides it, but it's nowhere near as effective as egg yolks.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any little source of Vitamin B12 can keep a vegetarian in good health, as long as they avoid too many toxins. Many plants put out defensive substances designed to block our digestive enzymes. For example, proteolytic enzymes are blocked by polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs). It happens that a proteolytic enzyme in the thyroid gland allows it to secrete hormone. So the same thing plants put in seeds to prevent them from being digested inhibits thyroid secretion if that fat circulates in the bloodstream.

**Taya Skerry:** Most people consume far more polyunsaturated fats in nuts, thinking they are getting protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 30 years ago, I met a young woman who was wasting away. She tried to eat eggs and meat but couldn't digest any protein. She was down to 65 pounds. I knew about research on amino acid equivalents found in potatoes—potato protein has a higher quality rank than egg yolk protein. When this woman ate meat, she would burp ammonia; something was causing the protein to short-circuit into ammonia.

I juiced some potatoes for her, removed the starch, and cooked the juice like a scrambled egg. She could eat it without the ammonia burps. From that single meal on, she went straight up to 130 pounds. I've seen people with insomnia and dementia fall asleep while eating a bowl of this potato juice soup because it works so fast to energize the brain and start protein synthesis. If vegetarians emphasize protein from potatoes and not nuts (which contain inhibitors), they would be better off. You don't really assimilate protein of value from oily nuts and seeds.

## Fats: Coconut vs. Fish Oil

**Taya Skerry:** The only fat really recommended is coconut oil—the saturated fat most people are scared of.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the first studies I saw involved feeding rats low-fat, average-fat, or high-fat diets using either coconut oil or corn oil. At the end of their lives, the fattest rats were the ones who had the unsaturated fats (corn oil), regardless of whether it was a low or high-fat diet. The leanest animals were the ones getting the coconut oil, even on a high-fat diet.

**Taya Skerry:** I get a buzz every time I have coconut oil; it's instant energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mitochondria can use it directly as if it were sugar for energy production. Even long-chain saturated fats have protective functions. Liver researchers are finding that alcoholics with cirrhosis can be cured if they eliminate polyunsaturated fats and replace them with saturated fats like stearic acid and coconut oil.

**Taya Skerry:** What about fish oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just recently, a prenatal study compared the intelligence of the fetus with the amount of fish oil in the mother's diet. They found that the only things corresponding to better memory and learning were the *absence* of the so-called essential fatty acids and long-chain fish oils. A deficiency of those prenatally was demonstrated to make the human fetus learn better.

**Taya Skerry:** So fish oil is not as good as we believe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are many studies people aren't told about where fish oil increases metastatic cancer and has serious immunosuppressive effects.

**Taya Skerry:** Is it because the oil oxidizes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some experimenters found that the anti-inflammatory effect—which is why people take it—only exists *after* the oil has been oxidized. It oxidizes so spontaneously that by the time it gets into your bloodstream, it's almost always oxidized. The so-called beneficial effects are associated with its breakdown products.

**Taya Skerry:** Should we avoid salmon and sardines then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I avoid them because of the toxic effects. In the last few years, breakdown products called neuroprostanes have been found in the brain, highly associated with Alzheimer's dementia. Their origin can be traced directly to the DHA and EPA of fish oils. So, looking at the prenatal effect and the Alzheimer's effect, both ends incriminate fish oil as a toxin.

## Exercise and Physiology

**Taya Skerry:** Speaking of energy, we are advised to do aerobic exercise, yet often it seems counterproductive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you reach the threshold where lactic acid rises—when you feel out of breath—that lactic acid has a pro-inflammatory effect. This goes with falling blood sugar. When lactic acid appears, sugar is low, and you can't make active thyroid hormone. If your nutrition isn't ideal, one episode of lactic acid-producing exercise is enough to knock you into a lower metabolic state.

**Taya Skerry:** So high intensity to failure and resting is better than cardio?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Eastern European physiologists discovered they could improve performance by making athletes stop exercising before lactic acid built up. Lifting a dumbbell just a few times causes muscles to produce testosterone and DHEA. The muscle becomes a steroidogenic gland when properly stimulated and not forced to produce lactic acid.

Ideally, exercise should be mostly **concentric**, meaning load while shortening the muscle, and no load while relaxing. That would mean running upstairs and sliding down the banister, or riding a bicycle uphill and coasting down.

**Taya Skerry:** The bottom line is to do less when it comes to intense exercise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Or more of the right kind and none of the wrong kind.

## Conclusion

**Taya Skerry:** You studied linguistics before biology. How was your PhD thesis received in 1972?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think professors usually devote much time to thinking about their students' work. No one really paid attention to the basic thesis very much. I shifted from linguistics to reproductive physiology because I found the linguistics culture—specifically Noam Chomsky's views—to be dogmatic. I found brain biologists were similarly authoritarian. Reproductive physiologists were the least dogmatic biology community at the time.

**Taya Skerry:** Is there such a thing as a scientific fact?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there is such a thing as a fact—the experience, the actual substance perceived. But we live in a world of meaning. The process of imposing meaning on those facts is where science becomes like the linguistics situation I studied. We live in a universe of meaning which, for most people, is nothing but the culture and language they grew up knowing. An ant and I can experience a situation, and I'll tend to agree with the ant more than I'll agree with a biologist or physicist, because the animal looks at the situation freshly without linguistic preconceived ideas.

**Taya Skerry:** Raymond, it's been a pleasure. Your website is www.raypeat.com. Thank you for being on the hot seat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Taya Skerry:** Bye for now. To your health.
