---## Introduction

**Danny Roddy:** Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy, and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, and biologist, Raymond Peat. In this episode, we'll talk about the benefits and risks of various commercial pharmaceuticals and supplements.

## Politics, Capitalism, and Physiology

**Danny Roddy:** The conversation with Gavin was extremely enlightening. I'm not especially interested in politics, but I am interested in your painting of physiology. Knowing some of the things that you talk about, I was interested in anarcho-capitalism. After reading that Gavin article, it kind of shook me out of that mindset and got me thinking that capitalism wasn't the best thing for health and society. Was that similar to what you were saying in that article?

**Ray Peat:** The idea of accumulating capital so you can build machines—people wouldn't have built steam locomotives and ships if they hadn't accumulated capital. Lots of good things come from accumulating capital and putting it in one place. But the trouble is, as Marx pointed out, it tends to accumulate all in a few hands. Then the system stops running because no one can buy what is produced so efficiently in factories. So, you have business cycles.

Lenin said they discovered that you can cure the business cycle by having imperialism and invading countries to make them buy your product and keep the system running. As long as you have wars, capitalism has no problem. But that's the problem. It has its internal contradictions and tends to cycle down to a crash every few years if you don't have some way to break out of that.

**Danny Roddy:** It almost perfectly put things into perspective regarding something Bucky Fuller said. He was trying to shake the notion of everybody having to earn a living. I was confused at what he was talking about, but he was saying that technology was getting better and better, and that would free up more people from this barbaric idea of having to earn your place on the planet.

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, that was Fuller. I admired him. I listened to one of his lectures when he came to Oregon. He talked, I think, six hours steady until they closed the shop. He and Fidel Castro were experts at putting the whole world story in one lecture.

**Danny Roddy:** I was reading two other papers by a guy named Paul K. Piff. He was talking about the social and stress consequences of capitalism. He has papers called "Having Less, Giving More" and "The Influence of Social Class on Pro-Social Behavior." It seemed to tie into what you were talking about.

**Ray Peat:** The culture has functioned as a system of illusions to help keep a dysfunctional system working—to make the people think that they're better off than they are. I think working on the culture is really where political work should be done. Propaganda analysis everywhere, including science and philosophy.

**Danny Roddy:** It's almost like the food pyramid and the political system synergize to destabilize a person. Like the undigested starches and the capitalism are a perfect storm for a weird culture.

## The Dangers of Commercial Supplements

**Danny Roddy:** Let's get on to supplements. I don't remember when I first heard you say that you preferred using the oily supplements on your skin, but I initially rejected it because it didn't fit my life. Recently, I started putting them on my legs and stopped eating them, and various small things resolved themselves. You’ve mentioned before that you were known for getting people *off* of their supplements.

**Ray Peat:** In the late sixties, when I came to Eugene, I knew someone who started the local free clinic. In Eugene, the fields all around were growing grass for the seed industry. At the end of the summer, they would burn their fields, and all of the pesticides would be vaporized and blow into town. People with asthma were more likely to die during the smoky seasons.

My friend with the free clinic was constantly sending allergy people to me. I found that they were all taking ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and Vitamin A—the usual things people take for allergies. I had just been trying out Linus Pauling's idea of big doses of Vitamin C. My first bad experience with Vitamin C was in the mid-1950s when it suddenly got very cheap. I tried a 500-milligram tablet and woke up the next morning with a sore throat and cold symptoms. Over the years, I saw that repeatedly: a big dose of Vitamin C always gave me some kind of cold symptom reaction.

Around 1968, when I started seeing these allergy people, they were all taking Vitamin C and other supplements. I suggested they try stopping them. Almost without exception, they would come back and say that their allergies were gone for the first time in years within a week of stopping.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you suspect it was due to some kind of endotoxin or irritation from the intestine?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah. One of the things endotoxin does is impair oxidation of the lining of the intestine and create a reduced state—too many electrons. Sulfites and ascorbic acid are very powerful reductants. I think the combination of endotoxin and a massive chemical reductant can interact and set up a big inflammation in the intestine. Reflexes from that cause the nose to run and eyes to water.

**Danny Roddy:** Did that shift your thinking to be much more careful about supplements?

**Ray Peat:** Yes. I had previously found that after dental x-rays, I had leukoplakia on the inside of my cheek for six months. The third time it happened, it occurred to me that Vitamin A would be destroyed by x-rays just as much as it is by sunburn. I took a big dose of Vitamin A and it immediately cleared up the leukoplakia overnight.

However, as I continued taking Vitamin A as a regular supplement, I started getting headaches from it. I found that just a touch of it on my lips would give me a migraine the next morning. I tried out a series of individual supplements and found that riboflavin (Vitamin B2) was almost as powerful as ascorbic acid for giving me an immediate headache or asthma symptoms. Rutin was another intense one. Talking to people with allergies confirmed that ascorbic acid was the number one problem, but Vitamin B2, rutin, and sometimes Vitamin A also caused problems.

## Contamination and Manufacturing Issues

**Danny Roddy:** Do you suspect these substances are made in a cheap way that poses risks?

**Ray Peat:** When Vitamin C was first on the market up until 1953 or '54, it was sold in very small 50-milligram tablets. That was during the time when all of the classical amazing results were published. I think that was because it was free of contaminants. The new cheap way of making it from glucose involved sulfuric acid, which was almost always contaminated with lead.

Over the decades, there have been chemical innovations for making it even more cheaply, but each introduces some kind of chemical adulterant. In the *Journal of Free Radical Biology* in the late '90s, someone published a study of reagent-grade, high-purity ascorbic acid. They dissolved a gram in a liter of distilled water and measured it in an electron spin analyzer. The researcher said that spontaneously, upon dissolving, the content of free radicals was as high as would have been produced by a killing dose of x-rays. He said it was amazing this amount of free radicals didn't kill the intestines. It was apparently from traces of heavy metals like iron.

**Danny Roddy:** That's just one problem. I imagine the casings and fillers are added variables.

**Ray Peat:** Every additive has its own manufacturing history, and every reagent used in making that thing has its own history. When you look at every excipient in a product, each one has many components, each of which has its own history and opportunity for contamination.

## Evaluating Safety: The Purity of Nature

**Danny Roddy:** What is your general process for evaluating if something is safe?

**Ray Peat:** My thinking got started in 1960 when they were analyzing the amount of strontium-90 from atomic bomb fallout. They were collecting baby's teeth to measure exposure. Strontium-90 concentrates in the bone, and radiation exposure to the bone marrow promotes leukemia. Because strontium-90 is similar to calcium, it associates in milk. The government was warning parents not to feed their children so much milk.

I looked at how the strontium-90 got into the milk. It falls onto the ground in the rain. The plants absorb both calcium and strontium-90. When the cow eats the grass, the cow purifies and selects for the calcium over the strontium. If you look at the ratio in grass versus cow meat and milk, the milk has the least strontium-90 in proportion to calcium.

Every organism is a purifying system, getting what's good and excluding what's bad. The safest thing is to get the purest food possible from an animal like a cow producing milk, which is multiply filtered from the environmental source. When they talk about chemical purity, that's only a reality in the mind of the chemist. In relation to biological nutrients, it's wildly out of the ballpark in terms of contamination. Any natural food is extremely purified. Any supplement made chemically is going to be dirty in principle.

**Danny Roddy:** Sometimes I get an email from someone saying, "I'm not eating liver, but I'm taking Vitamin A and the B vitamins." It seems like a non-sequitur.

**Ray Peat:** You get lots of unnamed and unidentified nutrients in any living tissue. For example, in mushrooms, the content has hardly been sketched out. There are thousands of potentially valuable nutrients that simply haven't been identified.

**Danny Roddy:** That was a motivator for me. Substances like apigenin and naringenin in foods became more interesting than supplements.

**Ray Peat:** Some fruits, like the cherimoya, have amazing still-unidentified substances. Mark Twain said it was the best-tasting substance in the universe.

**Danny Roddy:** And marmalade, too. Something you would normally throw away that is full of naringenin.

**Ray Peat:** Orange peel is usually thrown away, but if they're good oranges and well prepared, the marmalade is like a super drug. The sugar itself is part of the nutritional wonder drug.

## Drug Safety and Finasteride

**Danny Roddy:** When health gets in a really serious condition and drugs would be of value, are there certain ones you think of that have a proven safety record?

**Ray Peat:** A general rule is that the oldest ones are best. They've been tested for more years. Since the pharmaceutical industry took over, they have 20-year cycles where they talk about a new generation of drugs. The first generation is usually the safest and most effective. The subsequent generations are more weirdly dangerous, but the toxic side effects haven't been published yet.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there any way of understanding side effect data to understand the real risks?

**Ray Peat:** I assume most middle-term side effects would have been noticed after 50 years. If it's going to bring on cancer, you have to use it for at least 20, preferably 40 years to know.

**Danny Roddy:** Finasteride is probably a good example. It seems like it's ruining lives.

**Ray Peat:** I hear from a lot of people who have had trouble from that. Brain chemistry depends on it. The metabolism of progesterone as well as testosterone in your brain—if you block any of the enzymes used in making it, you're going to have a weird brain.

**Danny Roddy:** There's a famous quote from the FDA saying that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) apparently wasn't used in the organism or had no function.

**Ray Peat:** It works on the progesterone system too. They said progesterone is only a pregnancy-related chemical, neglecting that the brain absolutely depends on making it. It's a major brain hormone that you're messing with when you try to stop the production of DHT.

**Danny Roddy:** So restoring pregnenolone, DHEA, and thyroid function would be a good start to resolve that?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, and even better to start with increasing your cholesterol production, which means keeping your intestine and liver in good condition.

## Nutrient Deficiencies and Case Studies

**Danny Roddy:** Can we talk about nutrient deficiencies?

**Ray Peat:** I had interesting experiences. 50 milligrams of Vitamin C cured horrible cases of poison oak for me. Around that same period, I was feeling gloomy and took a tablet of Vitamin B1; in minutes, I had a clear, happy perspective.

When I worked in the woods, I was getting acne. I realized that my retina uses a lot of Vitamin A. The eye is the main regulator of your reproductive hormones. Light activates your adrenals and gonads to produce steroids, and the production of steroids is a heavy consumer of Vitamin A. From that insight, I took a big dose of Vitamin A and immediately the pimples subsided.

Another time, a friend's niece was in the hospital with uncontrollable diarrhea. I gave him a tablet of Vitamin B6 (10 milligrams). He gave it to the little girl, and within an hour, her diarrhea stopped. Instant recovery.

A neighbor of mine had a big alcoholic nose—red, large, and shiny. He had a problem with vocabulary; he would struggle to find the right word. I described how Vitamin B2 is essential for oxidation. He finally got a shot of vitamins from the doctor. Within a day or two, he was talking fluently, and his nose was a normal pink color.

**Danny Roddy:** Basically, it's endless what could be considered a deficiency—any kind of abnormal behavior?

**Ray Peat:** A friend had a four-year-old kid who would have violent tantrums every afternoon and wake up screaming with a nosebleed at night. We made cookies with 10 milligrams of Vitamin B2. He ate them that afternoon, slept through the night without the nightmare or nosebleed, and never had those horrible tantrums again.

**Danny Roddy:** What are your thoughts on the versatility of the body? Does it need everything every day?

**Ray Peat:** Someone did experiments on rats using the cornea to test Vitamin B2 deficiency. They found that the mitochondria were essentially collapsed or structurally changed so that they no longer would take up Vitamin B2 when it was given. Your nutritional requirements depend on your parents, your grandparents, and every generation before that. Something that makes your mother low in thyroid or high in estrogen during your gestation sets a pattern that will greatly increase your requirements.

## Thyroid and Traditional Diets

**Danny Roddy:** You've mentioned that meat eaters would normally get a fourth to a half a grain of thyroid in their food every day. Do you look at thyroid like eating oysters and liver?

**Ray Peat:** Seeing the ways country people ate in Mexico, I realized that a traditional diet was nutritionally very complex and included hormones, especially the thyroid gland. People would eat chicken necks, fish heads, and save all the glands from pigs to use in sausages. The blood, for example, carries a lot of hormones and is a frequent component of food in traditional diets.

**Danny Roddy:** I recall you used to have people read books on thyroid before they took anything. Do you think that's a good approach?

**Ray Peat:** When you don't know the client very well, it's best to give them the information to take responsibility for themselves. But if I saw someone in a suicidal condition, I would intervene by giving them quick-acting thyroid or progesterone. If you are just consulting random people, it's better if you make them get informed so they can watch themselves undergo the changes.

## Hypothyroidism and Nutrient Requirements

**Danny Roddy:** Is something like magnesium especially important for the hypothyroid person?

**Ray Peat:** Thyroid is required to retain magnesium by cells. When you're hypothyroid, the slightest stress makes magnesium fall out of your cells and get lost in the urine. A constant daily supply is essential to prevent cramps and depression. But once your thyroid is up where it should be, you can go for two weeks or more without the required amount of magnesium.

**Danny Roddy:** That Traskin study on Vitamin A—he thought healthier people needed more Vitamin A?

**Ray Peat:** Yes, because you're turning over your cholesterol to progesterone and testosterone chemistry constantly. That uses lots of Vitamin A. When your thyroid is low, you have a very low requirement for Vitamin A.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there any dead giveaway for a Vitamin A or K deficiency?

**Ray Peat:** I think experimentation is best. When a person has extremely high pulse pressure—the difference between systolic and diastolic is 70 or more—I figure they should try big doses of Vitamin K. It is needed for keeping calcium out of your arteries. As they become Vitamin K deficient and calcium overloaded, the arteries become stiff. I've seen people bring their top and bottom numbers much closer in just a week or two from a big Vitamin K supplement.

## Topical Application of Vitamins

**Danny Roddy:** Can you explain the process for using Vitamins D, A, and K topically?

**Ray Peat:** You have to use about 10 times the oral dose. If you're going to bathe every day, you need more because it takes time for Vitamin D to soak in. The faster your skin is being replaced, the more Vitamin D is lost with shedding cells.

**Danny Roddy:** So if you wanted to use 5,000 IU of Vitamin D per day, you should put 50,000 IU on your skin?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, but you should still have a blood test after doing it for a while. Some people with sensitive, thin skin might absorb as much as 30 or 40% of what they put on.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you use a combination of those every day?

**Ray Peat:** In the winter, I try to do it every day. In the summer, the food supply is usually fresher, so I often don't use them every day.

## Probiotics and Antibiotics

**Danny Roddy:** What are your thoughts on the probiotic strains *B. licheniformis* and *B. subtilis*?

**Ray Peat:** There are safe antibiotics that can work for people with bowel dysbiosis. But the first thing is to cut out the foods supporting the bad bacteria—usually polyunsaturated fatty acids and hard-to-digest starchy fibrous foods. Disinfecting foods such as cooked mushrooms and raw carrots are natural antibiotics. But when you have a really intense bacterial problem, *B. subtilis* and *B. licheniformis* are useful.

**Danny Roddy:** Would this be useful in place of antibiotics like penicillin?

**Ray Peat:** Yes, but I've seen just carrot salad every day work just as well as penicillin for reducing the stress causing a hormone imbalance.

## Aspirin and Vitamin K

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think aspirin should be dissolved in water? And what is the relationship between aspirin and Vitamin K?

**Ray Peat:** It's not an acute thing. The effect of aspirin knocking out clotting platelet function is trivial regarding the actual benefit. The effect that can cause uncontrolled bleeding is by interfering with proteins produced by the liver under the influence of Vitamin K. If you have taken antibiotics and have a deficiency of the bacteria that produces Vitamin K, you're susceptible to aspirin knocking out this clotting protein. Just as insurance, it's good to have a source of Vitamin K in your diet.

**Danny Roddy:** These are proteins S and C?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, those are made under the influence of Vitamin K. They are anticoagulant factors. People with excess clotting problems are sometimes told to avoid Vitamin K, but if you haven't measured proteins S and C, that might be the worst thing to do. Vitamin K is required for the normal resolution of stimulated clotting.

## Mushrooms

**Danny Roddy:** Does the inclusion of mushrooms change your diet recommendations? Can you replace the carrot if you eat mushrooms?

**Ray Peat:** Yeah, I've done that. I got tired of carrots after eating one a day for 20 years. Bamboo shoots are another alternative.

**Danny Roddy:** Would it be risky to replace eggs with mushrooms?

**Ray Peat:** Mushrooms have good broad-spectrum nutritional value, but you just have to eat an awful lot of them.

**Danny Roddy:** How much have you been averaging?

**Ray Peat:** Sometimes ridiculous amounts. Once every week or two, we'll have a big bowl of mushroom soup, which is almost like porridge—probably eight ounces. Other days, much less, like liver with mushrooms, probably four ounces.

## Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** If you could take any substance on a desert island, what would it be?

**Ray Peat:** Probably either pregnenolone or progesterone. If you fall off a cliff, get sunburned, or get bitten by a strange animal, you want to have a lot of progesterone. It's kind of a universal antidote.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, thank you so much for talking with me. Can you let people know how they can purchase your newsletter?
