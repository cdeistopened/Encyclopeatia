---# Introduction: Technical Difficulties and Newsletter Topics

**Danny Roddy:** Hey everyone, we just wrapped up live stream number 51 with Ray Peat. We had issues with bandwidth and the sound is popping, so it is imperfect, but I stitched together the silence and I thought the content was excellent.

We have Dr. Raymond Peat and Georgi Dinkov. Ray, your newest newsletter just came out: "Cumulative Damage, Degeneration and Aging: Possibilities of Reversal." It had a lot to do with heat shock proteins. Do you want to talk about your motivation for writing it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is part of the general picture of how to understand biology usefully. The reductionist approach of breaking it up into parts provides an infinite amount of knowledge that you can never do anything with. But if you understand the principle of how the organism works, you see that bacteria don't have our analytic abilities, yet they have the intelligence to redesign themselves radically to meet a challenging environment.

Barbara McClintock showed that the same sort of redesigning of the genome happens in plants. If bacteria and plants can radically change themselves to do better in the world, there is no reason people should feel weighted down by the ballast of genes inherited from reptiles.

The factors of this simplifying picture are the physics of phase change—essentially what Gilbert Ling was talking about. This was a major movement early in the 20th century for understanding the origin of life. That view sees life as a substance rather than an accumulation of 20,000 independent pieces of DNA. Life as a substance can change phase in the direction of losing energy, or, with good luck, come back to a high-energy state because all parts are subordinate to the flow of energy managed by the whole organism.

**Danny Roddy:** You talked about Le Chatelier's principle. Is this related to the cave fish example you’ve mentioned before? Where river fish diverted into a cave lost their eyes and became clear to adapt to their environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When I was in graduate school, people were still doing experiments of that sort. One experiment fed fruit flies a very high salt diet, and they adaptively changed their cuticle so it wasn't irritated by the flow of salt. Another put them under very hot artificial light, causing the wing structure to thicken. These were first-generation adaptations to a stressful environment.

Then, they turned off the light, gave them a normal diet, and cross-bred them. From then on, they had a Mendelian-like inheritance of these traits. They sorted out generation after generation with the thickened scales and veins. When I asked my professors, the standard reaction was, "Those were hidden genes. They were there all along." That is the scientific method genetics is based on: if it happens, it must have already been there in these immortal genes because nothing new happens.

## ATP, Phase Change, and Cellular Hardness

**Danny Roddy:** In your newsletter, you discuss Gilbert Ling and ATP as the "cardinal adsorbent." ATP has to be present in the cell for this phase transition to happen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I mentioned that it functions as a protein solvent. If you lower your energy and don't have the ATP binding it and keeping the cell together, some proteins come out of solution and go into a different phase. These become stress-induced organelles.

The practical use of that idea has been noticed since experiments by Albert Szent-Györgyi showed that ATP has a softening, relaxing effect on isolated protein material. It keeps everything together and in solution in the cytoplasm.

In a fatigued muscle, the muscle gets harder. When fully energized, the cytoplasm is flexible and soft but can contract to do maximum work. A fatigued heart gets harder, but on stimulation, it is already tight, so it can't do much more. ATP functionally represents the flow of energy. The energized, well-nourished cell is in a relaxed state. This relates to insomnia, muscle cramps, and even cancer.

Cancers can be diagnosed by their hardness. If a lymph node is hard to the touch, it is likely cancerous. The hardness involves the inability to relax and the stabilization of a fibrous form of actin. Depleted energy turns on collagen synthesis; the actin attaches to this growing collagen, and you get a system that is harder the more energy-depleted it is.

**Danny Roddy:** Was Szent-Györgyi the person who injected ATP into dead animals to reverse rigor mortis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, rigor mortis is the phase change. When you get smaller degrees of that phase change, you get chronic issues like intracellular bodies that produce inflammation, dementia, or prions—proteins that are no longer soluble.

**Danny Roddy:** This precedes cellular division when a cell is stressed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Promoting cell division is one alternative. You want to lose the complex, energy-consuming cell functions like thought and secretion. To escape the stress, the cell turns off differentiated functions and resorts to simple cell division. The hardening process is broken by activating the de-differentiating, cancer-producing property.

## Niacinamide and Solubility

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with studies from the 80s showing that niacinamide is a great substance for increasing solubility? I saw studies showing that mixing niacinamide with something lipophilic like progesterone increases its solubility in water by a few thousand percent. Considering the importance of niacinamide as an NAD precursor and its relationship with ATP, can niacinamide fill in for some of those roles ATP has as a solubility increaser?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it does. It is able to stop the energy loss. It turns off some of the deranged DNA repair mechanisms and can let the cell die peacefully rather than draining tremendous amounts of energy. It plugs the leak.

**Danny Roddy:** Would gelatin have some of those effects as well, increasing the solubility of intracellular proteins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It would probably depend on the starches present. Gelatin is bound to run into things like RNA and polymer carbohydrates that will affect the water-holding properties.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If I'm reading this correctly, an excess of unpaired electrons—which happens when metabolism is impaired—would greatly inhibit the solubility of proteins inside the cell. So things that accept those electrons, like quinones or other oxidizing agents, should improve solubility and retain the gelatin-like structure of the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and that should involve a constant flow. When the excess electrons are being drained away quickly enough into the electron vacuum of oxygen, that is the living state.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do the effects of estrogen on activating heat shock proteins and decreasing protein solubility relate to its activity as a reductant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The phenolic structure shifts electrons away from oxidation and changes the water-protein system. While stopping oxygen energy production, it activates enzymes governing glycolysis and lactic acid metabolism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is the role of progesterone as an inhibitor of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) formation a direct effect, or does it have more to do with opposing estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its direct action is probably on proteins in general, not just a progesterone receptor. It is effective on a great variety of proteins, including the cell division apparatus. It helps the cell retain water under control without the wetting property where estrogen releases water from proteins, making them swell with bulk, inactive water. Progesterone causes water to be bound into a solution with the proteins.

## Heat Shock Proteins: Benefit or Damage?

**Danny Roddy:** People in the health world say you should activate heat shock proteins via sauna to resist stress. How do you see that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is true they help a cell survive partial cooking. That is where the idea of them being beneficial comes from—they help survival in terrible conditions. However, drug companies have noticed that this process de-energizes cells, turning them toward a lactic acid, cancer-like metabolism. As the life of the cell is saved by the heat shock proteins, its energy reverts to that simple metabolism.

**Danny Roddy:** Didn't you say that the activation of the system leaves a "scar," meaning the ability to generate energy won't ever be the same?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is the general line of aging. It is like a ratchet that keeps you alive for the moment, but each time it is called on, it reduces your flexibility. It plugs a hole but limits function. Getting rid of that high quantity of heat shock proteins while energizing the whole cell is the goal. Progesterone blocks and reverts the heat shock state, activates the right kind of energy production, suppresses lactic acid, antagonizes estrogen, and blocks collagen production.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There are studies showing the HPA axis and cortisol are just as potent at activating HSPs. It seems any type of stress, not just heat, activates them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They block the disorganizing factors that come from everything that de-energizes the cell.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So aging occurs every time there is a demand placed on us by the environment that we cannot meet energetically.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct. If you pay attention during stress, you can learn to taste it in your mouth and smell it in your expired air. For example, if you stay in a hot bath too long, you might get a metallic taste and a dry, odd odor. You realize that if you have a pint of orange juice, you can stop those processes.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that metallic taste due to actual metal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it is lipid peroxidation. Since metals cause it, we associate the taste with metals, but it is the lipid peroxides you are tasting.

## Progesterone and Progest-E

**Danny Roddy:** I want to talk about Progest-E. Ray, you've mentioned you are confident in this product.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've used it for 45 years. I experimented with safe and effective solvents and came up with the Progest-E complex formula in the 1970s. I tried it on a roommate's pet rabbit that had a brain tumor and couldn't hop or stand. I rubbed the oily solution on the skin inside its ears. It went into a deep sleep, and hours later, it leaped to its feet like a new rabbit. It hopped to a wall and urinated copiously, unloading a large amount of water that had been causing swelling and pressure.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Why would progesterone fill in for the adrenal glands but pregnenolone wouldn't? Selye's experiments showed pregnenolone wasn't as effective for survival in adrenalectomized rats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Selye showed that each steroid has a range of properties. Progesterone will fill in for a deficiency of aldosterone, cortisol, or androgen, but it will also protect against a toxic dose of those same things because it has a weak mineralocorticoid effect. I classify progesterone as a non-hormonal steroid because it stabilizes the energy and structural systems rather than causing excitation.

**Danny Roddy:** If someone has a sensitive stomach, how can they take Progest-E orally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A large amount of vitamin E can be sticky and cause nausea. If you mix it with butter and take it with food, like a baked potato, you don't even notice it.

## Androgens: DHT and Testosterone

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi and I have been discussing DHT. Ray, you've been clear that defining-feature hormones shouldn't be messed with unless you have specific knowledge of a deficiency.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything you do changes a million things about the organism. If someone is dying of cancer, you don't worry about their sex life in five years. But generally, you should view the problem as energy depletion and inflammation. You should look at thyroid, carbon dioxide, glucose, amino acid balance, and anti-inflammatory things like aspirin and coffee before hormones.

**Danny Roddy:** So those foundational things should be explored before trying testosterone or DHT?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but in conjunction with adequate sugar and nutrition. Hormonal effects can leave the estrogen excitatory process in the brain to dominate, creating an obsessive process. When you lose interest in your particular health problem, you are probably on the right track.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If a male has a severe deficiency, wouldn't it be less risky to use DHT given its inability to turn into estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. Clinics give ridiculous doses of testosterone, like 50 or 100 milligrams, whereas a healthy male makes 4 or 5 milligrams a day. If you take 1 milligram of DHT backed by DHEA, progesterone, aspirin, and sugar, the DHT is more likely to have a constructive repairing role.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I've been experimenting with DHT. It seems to have a neutralizing effect on the nervous system. Nothing terminates a severe stress reaction for me like a few milligrams of DHT.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is acting as an anti-inflammatory. But just because it makes you feel good doesn't mean you should get stuck on it without fixing the energy system that started the process.

## Aspirin Dosage

**Danny Roddy:** What do you consider a max dose of aspirin at a single time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have taken as much as a gram, but usually 300 to 500 milligrams at a time with food is safe. You can repeat that amount safely.

**Georgi Dinkov:** In higher doses, aspirin depletes L-carnitine and works similarly to the drug meldonium, inhibiting fat oxidation and causing a drop in blood sugar. I would take it with something sweet if using higher doses.

## Mushrooms and Agaritine

**Danny Roddy:** I got questions about agaritine in mushrooms. When cooking mushrooms for three hours, are we getting rid of the agaritine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it either turns into something very different or vaporizes. The water doesn't contain the agaritine after a few hours.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Looking at the structure, agaritine looks highly estrogenic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen data on that, but it is labeled a carcinogen.

## Fungal vs. Bacterial Infections

**Danny Roddy:** Is there a way to distinguish between a fungal and bacterial infection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fungus is a nucleated cell that works similarly to a human cell. Poisons used to treat them often knock out our own mitochondria. People convinced they have systemic fungal infections take toxic drugs and get worse, blaming the fungus when it is the drug.

If a bacterial infection reaches your bloodstream, it can be deadly quickly, but antibiotics work. If a fungus gets in your bloodstream, you might have a week to live because there are no safe, effective drugs for systemic fungal infection. However, people can have fungus thriving in the small intestine without it being systemic.

**Danny Roddy:** For intestinally bound fungal infection, what can be done?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do not starve the yeast. When yeast runs out of sugar, it attacks proteins and becomes invasive and toxic. The "no sugar" diet is not the approach. Fiber (like raw carrot) to stimulate the intestine, combined with vinegar and olive oil, helps disinfect the intestine.

**Danny Roddy:** Is olive oil preferred over coconut oil for this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. All saturated fatty acids are fairly germicidal.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Regarding antibiotics, doctors usually prescribe them for two weeks. Is there evidence for this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some studies found spores could germinate after 10 days, so they aim to kill the second infection.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about antibiotic resistance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On a population basis, hospitals breed resistant strains. In one person, it just doesn't happen.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does antibiotic use lead to fungal overgrowth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That famously happens with the heavy two-week program. It sterilizes the intestine. If you don't pay attention to hormones governing digestive enzymes, a sterile intestine is a good place for fungus. Flowers of sulfur can be used to prevent fungal overgrowth if taking antibiotics.

## Viruses and Pandemics

**Danny Roddy:** We have a listener question from Ozan asking why a virus would "want" to invade a human cell, suggesting they seem more like exosomes or information transfer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exosomes are produced by our cells for maintenance. When sick, they can spread sickness. The environment is full of genetic material from decomposed cells or pollen. Our cells can absorb this DNA.

If you question how viruses came into existence, I don't see any origin other than as escaped genetic material from complex organisms. Being in a depleted, inflamed state makes us susceptible to this DNA.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So blaming a virus solely for a worldwide pandemic is insane?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Inflammation causes damage to the intestine, leaking endotoxin and increasing serotonin. These cause clotting and blood vessel inflammation, which are the major killing effects. Treatments like azithromycin work because of their anti-inflammatory effects, not just by killing bacteria.

**Danny Roddy:** If they announced a "Roddy Virus" tomorrow and used fear, could that create a similar situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And putting a tube in someone's windpipe (intubation) destroys the lungs quickly. Hospitals were ordered to do that with no rational basis. A German doctor who used mild oxygen via cannula had zero deaths, while an adjoining hospital using intubation had 60% mortality.

## Politics, Authoritarianism, and Society

**Danny Roddy:** If a group has a "death culture" holy book, how can a functioning society be maintained?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Start with everything people can do that is not guided by that death culture. Shift attention to improving understanding of life. Curiosity is the pro-life essence of living behavior.

**Danny Roddy:** What is the artificial long-term struggle between humans?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mostly authoritarian versus authoritarian. Behind it is a doctrine of atomistic individualism that defines everyone else as a potential enemy. Authoritarians place the individual against nature, denying full human qualities to women, children, and animals, viewing them as material.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think technology has a natural proclivity to become a tool for authoritarian oppression?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Norbert Wiener, a designer of AI, rejected military research because he saw this. Bertrand Russell saw that logic became a matter of authoritarian reductionism. When you design a computable language, you design out the human properties that leave it open to innovation.

**Danny Roddy:** What about the idea that it is human nature to rule over others?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is what they say. But aggression in nature is usually self-defense. When survival is assured, cooperation becomes the rule, as Peter Kropotkin showed. Cooperation is the basic property of life.

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding the current economic situation, is the inflation purposeful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Inflating the dollar ruins anyone who doesn't own shares in the big corporations. They are deliberately killing small businesses so all economic activity is funneled through monopolies.

**Georgi Dinkov:** There is talk of civil war or revolt. If people try to topple the system, will they go full military dictatorship?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. During Occupy Wall Street, they had snipers ready. They are ahead of us.

**Danny Roddy:** One last question regarding Marx and the Rothschilds. People thought you were inconsistent because you spoke highly of Marx, but some claim he was funded by Rothschilds.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you read his article from 1843 on the Jewish Question? He was calling for the emancipation of Jews. His enemies were the Christian state. I don't know of any actual support from bankers to Marx.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Was the Soviet revolution a Zionist project?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. The Soviet government was a mix steered by Lenin to end Czarism and keep Western invaders out. It stayed free of the West for about 70 years until later leaders opened it to international banking.

**Danny Roddy:** We will end it there. Ray, thank you so much for staying over time. Georgi, thank you as well.
