---## Introduction: Ukraine, Russia, and the Empire

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, Generative Energy number 82 with Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov. Ray, you were just saying you were reading about the war. To the chagrin of everybody that hated the last time we talked about this stuff, I do want to talk about Ukraine and Russia once again. Give us an update on your point of view, everything you've learned or that has transpired since then, and where you think this is all heading.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I actually think it's all of a piece with the pandemic. I think all of it was planned out years ahead to do anything to destroy the economy so that the monopolies will have total power.

**Danny Roddy:** Like a planned-out war? Do you think if they said, "Oh, if we do this, then Russia will do that," it was planned out to a T?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I've read two or three articles by different people predicting exactly what's happening now in Ukraine and Europe eight years ago.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think China and Russia are also benefiting from this war? Are they using it to cover their own political and economic problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, definitely. The likely outcome, if they don't resort to nuclear war, will be for Russia and China to totally dominate the world economy. That's why the World Economic Forum class has been in such a panic for at least ten years.

**Danny Roddy:** How close do you think we are to nuclear war? What is the likelihood of that happening in your point of view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The chances within the next two hours are moderate and increasing, unless there's a dramatic reason for settling and establishing peace in Ukraine.

**Danny Roddy:** Did something happen a few hours ago, or today or yesterday?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, just the last several days. Everyone's intention has been expressed, and they are starting to realize that Russia so far has definitely been winning. They are on the threshold of totally losing the empire and for the whole world to start reorienting around the Asian economic system.

## The CIA and Historical Context of Nazism

**Danny Roddy:** Something we might have touched on last time, but I have since done a mild amount of investigation into, is that apparently the CIA was supporting all those white nationalist groups in Ukraine. Does that make the whole situation a little clearer if a person is under the impression that the CIA is the tool of the ruling elite, and they've been supporting these groups for 50 years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Remember when we talked about World War II and why the Cold War started? The Dulles family, the Bushes, and the banker class in general were working to create Hitler for their basic purpose. Since the First World War, the basic purpose of the ruling class has been to get access to Russia's resources without the Russians. That's been on the record for a long time.

The Germans had documents saying that the Russians, who couldn't be slave labor, would be sent off to starve in Siberia—essentially eliminating the population so that Germany could have the resources. But the United Kingdom and the US weren't happy with that falling solely into German control. So they worked with Hitler and supported his war against Russia to the extent that they figured they could destroy Russia and then take on Germany.

All of that was in place behind the scenes during Roosevelt's management of the war. Both England and the US were stalling month after month on joining the war. Stalin asked, "Wasn't it raining too much for you to invade the continent?" Finally, when they saw that Russia was driving straight through to the West, that was when they invaded to stop the Russians halfway.

Instantly when Roosevelt died, that faction represented by Harry Truman was in control. Since Truman, the support of the Nazis and working with the Nazis everywhere—Ukrainian and Hungarian fascists, Polish fascists, everyone who lost their power temporarily in Europe—moved to North America, mostly Canada and the US. Now those people are adding their weight to American policy. The Ukrainian fascists have been in business right since they allied themselves with Hitler during the war.

**Danny Roddy:** Just to be clear, I think we have talked about this before, but the huge problem with Nazism in your view is the eugenicist aspect of it? Because again, if you like Trump now, you're called a Nazi. Just to clarify that term.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it's a whole scheme for the World Economic Forum type—the absolute ruling class—to control everything. Not just genocide; that is just something along the way to make that happen and become stable. It's an idea of ruling the world.

## The End of Western Hegemony

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi, you can interrupt at any time. A comment I received multiple times after the last conversation was, "What is Ray talking about here? Isn't he anti-war?" A few days ago, Trump put out a statement saying that for the good of the world, peace has to be established in Ukraine, and he's supporting two anti-war candidates for Congress. Part of his being called a Nazi is that he's against war. But I guess in the empire game, there isn't really a way to be a pacifist. Do you think violence is necessary, or maybe for the elites to use violence? You're not happy that people are dying in Ukraine or Russia, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the sooner they can stop it, the better. As Trump said, peace in Ukraine is the central world issue right now. But at the same time, without this war, the empire would have relentlessly continued subjugating and crushing everything in its path.

**Danny Roddy:** Putin has said that the outcome looks like it's going to be ending Western hegemony. What do you think that will manifest as?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, without the Asian, Russian, and Indian economies... if they form a new center, and if that's the new economic center, what is the Western world going to do with its collapsing or non-existent economy?

**Danny Roddy:** Wouldn't that mean collapse? And in that case, the elite loses its power?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm afraid it will turn into something much less than a third world—that the Shah of Iran might be a model for the government of the West.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If there's a widespread economic collapse, where is this power of the elite? What is it going to be based on if all of their money suddenly is worthless? All of their possessions abroad will probably be confiscated, as Russia has already started doing. The Chinese will probably follow suit soon enough. If the world dumps the Western model, doesn't the power of the elite disappear as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only thing they have remaining is weapons. They'll declare the common people their enemy, like the Shah of Iran did.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Oh wow. So basically they'll start cannibalizing each other as a way of maintaining power?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

## Israel and the "New Jerusalem"

**Danny Roddy:** Another thing we talked about is, where does Israel play into this whole empire game? Do you see them as regulating the US's activities?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are leaders in insisting that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, even though the leaders of the Azov factions fly swastikas and declare that they have all of the German Nazi symbols, salutes, and phrases. It's impossible to say that they're not Nazis, but Israel is saying since they aren't having Jewish genocide—at least not on a large scale—they can't be Nazis. That's the extent of Israel's reasoning. But they are practicing genocide against Russians. People in Israel are talking about Ukraine as the "New Jerusalem" historically, arguing that it's an extension of Israel.

**Danny Roddy:** Is that a prophecy thing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's the whole thing about the New Jerusalem. I've been hearing about it for many decades, but I don't really have an investigation of what the theological side is.

## Economic Collapse and Preparation

**Georgi Dinkov:** A little bit back to the war. I keep coming back to this theme: if the West loses control of the world financial markets and of the world's productive resources, what is the elite going to do with all of its fake money? How are they going to get the things they need if almost nothing is produced in the developed world anymore? Is war essentially their only resort?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think their plan is to use the military to control the "basket of deplorables."

**Georgi Dinkov:** Us, basically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mm-hmm.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So it will turn, just like you said regarding the Shah of Iran, into a brutal dictatorship in the so-called Western world, and then food will be rationed or non-existent altogether? That's kind of where things are going?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you're a well-behaving robot, then your bank account will show enough for food.

**Danny Roddy:** We were talking about that a little bit before we hit record. People don't like when we talk about this stuff but don't offer any type of solution. We understand the chess pieces being put in place regarding digital ID and food access. How are you inoculating yourself from those types of things? What would you tell other people to think about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People on the internet are giving instructions on how to make your own food if necessary—growing it in your windowsill, on your roof, and in the front yard instead of a lawn.

**Danny Roddy:** From your point of view, are there things you could grow that are calorically dense enough to really make a dent in a person's diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On a moderate plot of land, some of the fairly high-calorie root vegetables.

**Danny Roddy:** And just to run through them: sugar, maybe buying gelatin, ghee, what else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's good to have a few years of that stuff stored up. Get a few beehives for them to produce honey if you have nearby vegetation that they can eat.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think they'll allow the cities to become completely chaotic? The Fabian Society has a motto of "order through chaos." How crazy do you think they would let it get?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the police have the resources to keep everything—a lot of dead dissenters and other things—peaceful.

## Vaccines, Hepatitis, and Spike Proteins

**Danny Roddy:** We didn't really talk about the vaccine stuff last episode. A lot has transpired since then. Haven't some major landmark studies come out saying that the spike protein would not be localized, that it would venture into every part of the body and cause harm? Is there anything you've learned since the last time we talked?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The weight of the evidence is that Bhakdi and Yeadon were essentially right: it isn't just a temporary risk of death, but a very prolonged, maybe lifelong or transgenerational risk of degenerative disease and death. Did you see the new studies of the deadly hepatitis in children?

**Danny Roddy:** I didn't get that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Over the last week, there has been news from all over the world about the identification of a worrying rise of cases of hepatitis in children of unknown origin. It's so severe that about half of the children require liver transplants and some children have already died. No organ is exempt. Autopsies show extremely clear macroscopic evidence of the continued presence of the spike protein months and up to a year after the vaccine. There is evidence that they died of the vaccine with remote organs and blood vessels being infected by the spike RNA producing the antigen spike. The immune system kills the lining of the blood vessels that are infected, so there's a prolonged, maybe lifelong attack of the immune system against your own blood vessels, leading to clots. Having microscopic or macroscopic clots in the various vessels can create a wide variety of very nasty diseases.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Are you familiar with the condition Kawasaki disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not very familiar, but I know it's a clotting disorder.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Yeah, it's a chronic inflammation of the blood vessels. The cases of this have been rapidly rising again over the last two years and they're claiming they don't know what's causing it. Do you think the vaccines are capable of causing that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think any vaccine is capable of causing it. Just injecting aluminum hydroxide affects the brain. The particles travel not just into the bloodstream, but up the nerve axons into the brain cells themselves, modifying the brain so that it creates ongoing inflammation.

**Danny Roddy:** Kind of a weird question, but do you think the vaccines are more effective than the ruling elite thought, or less effective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably more effective than they imagined in their design, in the sense of killing people.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think that multi-schedule thing is to obscure the harm that they're doing? Or is that mechanism a slow death to accelerate any age-related problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the newest information, both from the UK and some coming out of the US, the more shots a person has, the more likely they are to die, be hospitalized, or be infected. One group of studies showed that with two shots and a booster, you were twice as likely to die or be hospitalized. Others in the UK show a three-fold increase in those serious outcomes for having the booster shot.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What do you think of the data coming out of the UK and Germany showing the potential that vaccines may cause vaccine-induced AIDS, or VAIDS as they call it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen those.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think they have the potential of causing chronic immune deficiency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, chronic immune arousal is at the same time causing deficient, defective immunity.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So the body will be busy attacking its own inflamed tissues instead of being capable of handling a new infection from an unknown virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Autoimmune people are a mild example of what is probably happening to the mass of the vaccinated people.

## Dealing with the Public and Personal Work

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, you've been interacting with the public for a long time. Are you finding it harder and harder to do that, maybe since people are cumulatively becoming more crazy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would say people are becoming dumber. Let's just be blunt about it.

**Danny Roddy:** Has that been especially difficult maybe this year or last year?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm getting more emails than ever before. The extreme fanatics have stopped sending me threatening letters. Maybe they got vaccinated. Maybe the vaccine did do something good after all.

**Danny Roddy:** I know you said it provides you information and orientation, but does it take a toll on you communicating with totally crazy people? Do you feel like it's your duty because you critique the culture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far as I can, I try to give them any available insight or support.

**Danny Roddy:** Even when that insight is immediately turned around and posted on a forum and disregarded? How do you constructively use your time, given that it's so easy to spiral out of control or be depressed about the situation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I keep working to some extent on things I've been interested in for many years, mainly the idea of ordering principles—the physics of life and potential. I almost never talk about that because people don't often ask me. But I'm paying more and more attention to physical questions and what the possibilities are suggested by some of these eccentric physical ideas.

**Danny Roddy:** So for you, your work is the guiding principle of your life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's all one piece, whether it's biology, physics, or ideas about consciousness.

## Physiology: PUFA, Stress, and Addiction

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi, interrupt me at any time. We only have an hour with Ray today. Ray, who would win in a battle of enduring stress between a germ-free rat and an EFA (essential fatty acid) deficient rat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, I've heard of EFA deficient. The experiments that have been done show the germ-free live longer and healthier, but they don't have the powerful stress resistance that the fatty acid deficient rats have.

**Danny Roddy:** Is there something that can bind with and deactivate PUFA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it's in the bloodstream.

**Danny Roddy:** I think you mentioned vitamin E once—I think it was Selye's idea or Broda Barnes's? Is there any substance that can actually bind with those fatty acids and make them less harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not in the blood, I think. It has to be the liver and kidneys excreting them.

**Danny Roddy:** Right, so we cannot really saturate them on demand while they're floating around in the blood?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So far, it's only intestinal or rumen bacteria using vitamin E that can do that.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think it's feasible to develop something? There are now drugs on the market that inhibit the absorption of all fats from the intestine. Do you think it would be possible to develop something that targets specifically the less saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, I'm sure that would be possible because they have a greater tendency to absorb at certain surfaces.

**Danny Roddy:** I was watching a documentary on the cartels producing fentanyl and I thought of your "Biological Balance and Addiction" newsletter. Is fentanyl having an anti-stress effect that makes people very addicted to it? What is your view of what happens when somebody becomes "addicted"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of this sense of freedom from social pain—a family that says they're worthless or a society that makes them feel worthless—they can just go into a dreamy state under the influence of morphine, for example. But that is imitating in some ways the euphoria that good steroid hormones should be producing. Part of the predisposition to use the drugs is that the stressful social conditions they're in are turning up their harmful hormones and suppressing their own progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone. That was how I found out that pregnenolone can help people withdraw pretty quickly from the opiates.

## Pregnenolone and Progesterone

**Georgi Dinkov:** Quick question about pregnenolone. Why do you think no pharma company so far has tried to develop pregnenolone, or at least use it in medicine as the "mother of all hormone replacement therapies"? If it's the precursor for all of them, wouldn't something like a transdermal cream or a suppository be able to replace all of these other HRTs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 1950s, there were studies showing that it's much better than cortisone or cortisol for those uses—anti-inflammatory and so on. But its role in the system makes it even worse [for pharma] than progesterone. Progesterone cures essentially everything: trauma, all of the degenerative and stress-related diseases. It's hormonally more powerful than pregnenolone, but pregnenolone has the same position in the system.

When you take other hormones, the body's production of that hormone decreases. But in the case of progesterone and pregnenolone, those substances support the body's production of more, up to their ability to make more. So if you're deficient in progesterone, sometimes a single dose or two can activate your body to return to normal production if you have the thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol needed. To a degree, the same situation exists with pregnenolone. It stabilizes the damaged mitochondria and makes it possible for your cells to organize energy production and more pregnenolone and progesterone production.

The drug companies first realized that progesterone and DHEA were terrible drugs because they tend to cure diseases. The effects of pregnenolone—there are no recognized hormonal effects—but if you have enough of it, in experiments, a rat could be given 10 grams per dose with no harmful effects except to stop stress hormone production. Pregnenolone is a relatively expensive material if you supplement it adequately. But since it isn't patentable, those three steroids are something that could essentially cure most of the current diseases if they were made available massively and cheaply. That doesn't interest the drug companies because they don't have patents.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So I guess my question was, was pregnenolone ever considered by the drug companies even before they realized it was going to destroy their business? Was there ever a publication or a conference where a doctor stood up and said, "Hey, instead of giving all these people these individual hormones, here we have pregnenolone"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. There was a symposium in 1950 that revealed the curative effects of pregnenolone and progesterone. But right in that same symposium, following an article on how massive amounts of progesterone were causing cervical cancer to disappear, that same journal published an article on treating cancer with estrogen. Their own data showed that estrogen caused the cancer to become worse, yet they concluded that estrogen has great promise as a cancer therapy. The pharmacologists and the research community were intelligent enough to know that a drug that could cure a disease but not be patented was worthless.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Was there a symposium in Mexico where Selye had a presentation? I think it was published with Abraham White as the editor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I have that in a PDF. I think it was in Mexico and there are a few studies on pregnenolone that were presented at that symposium.

## Russian Spirituality and Conclusion

**Danny Roddy:** I hate to bring it back to the Russia stuff, but Ray, in *Mind and Tissue*, you talk about one of the themes of Russian culture being the potential waiting to be fulfilled—Russia waiting to lead the world into a spiritual awakening, the spiritual richness of peasants, etc. You wrote that in 1973. You've been thinking about Russia for a very long time. Did you think this empire clash was going to happen for a long time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was just sort of a vague suspicion 50 years ago, but that's what you infer from reading people like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and the psychologists. They see a certain spiritual, psychological, cultural attitude as being necessary to save the world.

**Danny Roddy:** And the West is beyond rehabilitation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly. Because through the way Christianity reached Russia, they didn't make the fundamental mistakes about the nature of reality and the nature of the human being. The West is so committed to a kind of individualistic, random management of the physical world that the mental, spiritual world doesn't rest on any kind of real cosmology.

**Danny Roddy:** Okay, I'm going to let you go in a second here. You can purchase Ray's newsletter—it's $36 for 12 issues or $10 for four. You can email **raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com**. Are you backlogged with orders?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it takes sometimes a few weeks to even get an order acknowledged.

**Danny Roddy:** And for Progest-E from Kenogen, you can email **catherine.purchase.kenogen@gmail.com**. Ray, I really appreciate that you wrote a snippet on how to use progesterone for men. I posted it everywhere.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was just a page.

**Danny Roddy:** It was very useful. Ray, just let us know what you're working on next.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The last newsletter was on cancer. I'm going to fill in some of the background of that around some of the messenger substances that can be controlled to some extent to not just prevent cancer, but if you do it in a highly supportive way, even sometimes redress cancer.

**Danny Roddy:** Amazing. Thank you so much for joining us, Ray. Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much. We'll be back probably two weeks from now. Thanks again.
