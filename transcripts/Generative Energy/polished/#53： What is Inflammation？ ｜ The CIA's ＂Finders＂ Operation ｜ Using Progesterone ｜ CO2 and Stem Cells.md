---## Economics, Inflation, and Social Control

**Danny Roddy:** Georgi Dinkov and Ray Peat, thank you guys for joining us today. Ray, can you continue on that thought? We were talking about Bitcoin, inflation, and the general price increase of goods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The interest-free money that has been saving the economy for a few years... I think by the end of fall 2019, it was reaching the point where just free money and loans weren't enough. They had to figure out some way to radically change things. Bringing on the pandemic, or more wars, or something was needed.

I think the basic universal income is going to be phased in gradually with these measures. The checks to the public are going to get more frequent until finally it's like everyone is on a pension. That will make savings worthless. Once you have everyone basically on a pension, plus inflation that has destroyed any kind of savings, then you have people under control because you can change their pension at will.

**Danny Roddy:** You had a specific time frame—you said four to five years. What makes you think four to five years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just the rate of increasing inflation over the last two years or so.

**Georgi Dinkov:** One of the websites you mentioned, Zero Hedge, keeps talking about inflation and saying people should start buying gold. But I remember that up until 1964, the government had actually prohibited people from owning gold. Do you think something like that can happen again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, there won't be enough gold. It's already tending to disappear. The U.S. won't give back national gold that they were supposedly storing because it just isn't there. People have been investing in paper gold, and I think there just isn't enough real gold left. The price will go up if it isn't artificially held down like the government has been doing, but there isn't enough real gold to work as money anymore.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Remember former Senator Ron Paul? For decades he kept saying, "There is no gold at Fort Knox. They refuse to allow me to do an inspection. They keep doctoring the paperwork. We have only 1% of the physical gold that the United States claims." Do you think there's any truth to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Germany and Venezuela, for example, were asking to get their gold that had been stored for them in the U.S. The U.S. was simply stonewalling.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that may be one of the reasons why countries like Russia and China are rapidly increasing their physical gold reserves, preparing for the devaluation of the dollar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think so.

**Danny Roddy:** The idea behind Bitcoin is that it's finite and some people say it's better than gold. It seems to be getting some institutional support, but do you think this is just misdirection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Actually, there's nothing existing; it's a belief system. Right now, the changing beliefs about it have made some people very rich, but since it's basically a psychological currency, I think it can be manipulated out of existence whenever the world powers decide to.

**Danny Roddy:** In your view, is there any way to hedge your bets against the next four or five years of things getting really rough?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not really. If you have some land in a place that is survivable, enough water to support yourself, and some goats and chickens to grow some vegetables, then everything is good until some mobsters or governments decide to confiscate your land.

**Danny Roddy:** People accuse Georgi and me of being doomers, but when we talk to you, it really seems like things are not going to pick up anytime soon. I know you choose your words very carefully. I imagine you wouldn't say things would get bad just to put somebody in a learned helplessness situation. There is a quote about being a true friend if you tell someone the truth rather than sugarcoating it. What is your perspective on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is a way out, and that is for everyone—or at least half of the population—to wake up and actually think about things instead of prejudices that they've been taught since childhood. If they just start questioning basically every word in their language and looking at what the absence of facts in their belief system implies, that could lead to people asking questions.

What can we do about the situation in which a few thousand people are deliberately destroying everyone's livelihood, making them rapidly more dependent, and threatening bigger wars to keep people fearful? If millions of people start thinking about what can be done, then naturally basic intelligence is going to come up with some ideas.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What about the tactic of Gandhi—non-violent non-cooperation? Do you think if a sufficient number of people simply refuse to participate in the system, that would be enough to cripple it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, at some point, if there are enough people.

**Georgi Dinkov:** What would be a few things that would really put a dent into the system? Refusing to participate in social media or refusing to buy things online?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just absolute withdrawal from all of the stupid imposed digital systems. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Don't express your opinions on Facebook.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Which would require you meeting people physically, which would quickly end the pandemic restrictions because if everybody decides to meet others, you just can't lock them all up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's why people were ordered not to meet in groups bigger than five or ten. That used to be called sedition if you had five or six people gathering together on the street to talk about politics.

## Inflammation, Adaptation, and Aging

**Danny Roddy:** I want to jump into your new newsletter, Ray. It's called "Inflammation, Adaptation, and Aging." What was your motivation for writing this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a step to the next one, which will be how purpose and intentionality relate to development, inflammation, and aging. This is making the connections between heredity, adaptation, aging, inflammation, and disease resistance. It brings in the fact that the perfect environment is intrauterine, and then various things can go wrong after birth. If you're in a hospital, they can intensify everything that ordinarily would take 50 or 60 years to go wrong; they can do it in a couple of weeks.

**Danny Roddy:** It's popular to say, "Oh, that's because of inflammation," but it's never really nailed down what inflammation is. How do you define it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's what a healthy person who catches the COVID virus does *not* experience. Their immune system makes them totally unaware that there has been a virus in their body because the body is so complexly designed not to go wrong. It has to be a sick and dying person to get in trouble from a minor virus or bacteria. Once you're sick, you're already in an inflamed state. In that state, a virus is just another pro-inflammatory degenerative factor.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If one is deficient in PUFA (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids), is it even possible to experience a significant inflammatory reaction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The experiments with rats on a PUFA-free diet—so-called essential fatty acid-free diet—show they are tremendously resistant to inflammation and dying from poisons, physical trauma, and infectious agents. Something as crude as holding them by the tail and whacking them on the furniture... if they've been eating a standard PUFA-rich diet, they go into shock and die. If they don't have a noticeable amount of PUFA in their tissues, they are very tough.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, without PUFA, most of the inflammatory reaction is gone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. PUFA forms many things leading to inflammation. Prostaglandins are a very powerful amplifier of inflammation. Something like hypoglycemia can start the formation of prostaglandins, and once it starts, cytokines and circulatory changes get involved.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Could you say that the moment lactic acid is released out of the cell, that's the beginning of inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A shift away from oxidation of the PUFA will inhibit the ability to oxidize glucose. At that moment, you're experiencing reductive stress, or pseudo-hypoxia. The oxygen is there, but you aren't using it. That turns on lactic acid, which represents a reductive state—an excess of electrons. That transmits the reductive stress wherever it goes, tending to convert other cells to that same stress state.

## Stem Cells, Oxygen, and Tumors

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of reductive stress and the lack of oxygen, how does this relate to stem cell renewal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you stop oxidizing glucose because of low thyroid, nitric oxide, PUFA, or carbon monoxide, the enzymes stop reacting glucose with oxygen. The oxygen is still diffusing in, but it's not being consumed. The animal feels like it's suffocating, but it is actually becoming hyperoxic in the vicinity of those poisoned cells.

Hyperoxia is toxic to the mitochondria and changes the functions of the stem cells. It brings stem cells out of their quiescent state and starts them dividing. In an injury situation, the stem cells replace the dead cell. But if the cell doesn't get out of the way, the hyperoxia keeps the multiplication going and produces a tumor. If it is continuously in great excess, you deplete the stem cells and lose renewability of that tissue.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is carbon dioxide—the intracellular pH—the major signal for apoptosis of a barren cell and also the signal for the stem cells to start differentiating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The failure to produce carbon dioxide, yes.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Right, so the presence of it will allow the barren cell to commit suicide (apoptosis). Is that one mechanism through which the drug acetazolamide helps shrink tumors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Potentially, yes.

**Danny Roddy:** You've said before that "we're a big bag of stem cells," so it's more about the environment of those cells than just adding more into the system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I don't think taking them out of one place and putting them in another is going to do much.

**Georgi Dinkov:** If the intrauterine environment is ideal, should we live in an environment that mimics it—with a lot of glucose and carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and on a high mountain with a supply of good fruit. Your oxygen tension is lower at high altitude, closer to the fetal oxygen availability. If you're healthy enough to adapt, your CO2 level internally goes up and prevents the hyperventilation increase of pH inside cells that kills or ages them.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Is there an optimal range of altitude?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 8,000 to 12,000 feet is good.

## Oxidative Stress vs. Rate of Living

**Danny Roddy:** Are "oxidative stress" and "inflammation" synonymous terms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. They usually talk about oxidative stress as making free radicals, but the thing that turns that on is often a block to the ability to use oxygen. The traditional use of oxidative stress has been confused, defining it as equivalent to lipid peroxidation and free radical damage.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you know who came up with this term? When I read modern studies, researchers are administering drugs that block the electron transport chain to create "oxidative stress." The term seems bogus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it goes back to Raymond Pearl at Johns Hopkins—a bunch of reductionists with a basically anti-life view that the slower you live, the longer you live. Leonard Hayflick was in that line of thinking. It's a mechanical view. They fell for the idea that cells have a maximum division capability (the Hayflick limit). Back in the 60s, experiments showed our skin and intestine use up those 50 cell divisions in just a few weeks. Grafting experiments found that organs like mammary glands could undergo essentially an infinite number of cell divisions in an organism.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think the rate of living theory was inspired by the second law of thermodynamics and steam presses from the Industrial Revolution—"keep your machines cooler and they last longer"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. It's mechanical thinking. Nikolai Kozyrev showed that this physical idea was a belief in a "Big Bang" creationist universe. If you believe God wound up the universe clock at one moment, all it can do is run down. Kozyrev showed that if you don't make those religious assumptions, you can explain stellar energy sources and the fact that planets produce internal energy.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So time and space are essentially both properties of this *prima materia* Aristotle talked about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep.

## Viruses, Exosomes, and Vaccines

**Danny Roddy:** In your newsletter, you discuss the idea that tissue injury invites the virus or bacteria, and they aren't necessarily harmful in themselves.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I'm suggesting the probability that so-called viruses are little packets of nuclear material being exchanged throughout the world by every organism. Bacteria do it visibly. Every organism is circulating exosomes—packets of information—within themselves for repair, and releasing them into the environment.

**Danny Roddy:** If an inflamed cell has an abundance of electrons because metabolism is blocked, could a viral infection act as an emergency electron sink?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the system is working well, I think that's going on all the time. You can transmit actual mitochondria in those packets.

**Danny Roddy:** What kind of exosomes would people be emitting when they take the vaccine? Is it harmful to be around them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The purpose of the adjuvant (historically aluminum hydroxide) was to create systemic inflammation to stir up the immune system. The lipids in these RNA vaccines are just a lipid version of an adjuvant intended to create systemic inflammation.

Being around sick, inflamed people always has more risk. Once one person is under stress, they put out more exosomes. If those exosomes come from stressed cells rather than normal sources, they can be irritating and spread inflammation.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think that explains why nurses working in specific hospital wards tend to come down with similar conditions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

## Depopulation and Geopolitics

**Danny Roddy:** Mike Yeadon, a former Pfizer VP, said it's possible coronavirus vaccines will be used for massive-scale depopulation. Do you think he might be onto something?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, the possibility is there. When you look at the lying and deliberate breaking of the law by high government officials, the WHO, CDC, and foundations like Gates, you see them deliberately misleading the population. It's odd to assume they wouldn't be trying to execute their expressed long-range goals of population reduction.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Didn't Kissinger state back in the 70s that the destiny for the third world is extermination at the hands of Western powers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That policy was basically decided when Roosevelt died. Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie had decided on a post-war policy of bringing the third world up to the rest of society—a Marshall Plan for everyone. Right after the meeting, Willkie died unexpectedly. Then Roosevelt died. Immediately, policies changed back to the empire of exploiting them to death.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Stalin saw what happened to Roosevelt and didn't buy the official story. Does that explain why the Soviet Union became hard-line?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and even some of Roosevelt's relatives agreed with Stalin that it was an assassination.

**Danny Roddy:** Speaking of assassination, do you want to comment on John Magufuli (President of Tanzania)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He was the second African president who had opposed vaccinations who died suddenly. They were both very antagonistic to the WHO and vaccine campaigns.

## Progesterone and Thyroid

**Danny Roddy:** Regarding Progest-E, more men are starting to use it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A study was published showing that injecting micronized progesterone improved survival in men seriously infected with COVID. That is increasing interest. I had discouraged men for a long time because a big dose is like a cold shower and shrinks the penis, but that passes in a day or two. With proper dosing, it actually increases libido and keeps testosterone from being wasted and turned into estrogen.

**Danny Roddy:** How much progesterone does a healthy male make, and how should they dose it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A given dose promotes its own synthesis in the body. It facilitates thyroid secretion, which converts cholesterol to progesterone, and inhibits the aromatase enzyme that converts androgens to estrogen. It's not hormone replacement; it's a stress correction process.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I get questions from parents considering using Progest-E in children. Do you have reservations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For premature babies, giving a little progesterone can protect brain growth. If a mother normalizes her progesterone, the milk will be adequate. If you give it to a boy just as puberty is coming on, too much for too long could potentially delay development. But 5 or 10 milligrams a day can alleviate stress symptoms. Sometimes one dose of 20 milligrams cures the problem.

**Danny Roddy:** For a hypothyroid child, would progesterone be safer to try first than thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, usually it's good to use a small amount of thyroid as if you're eating a traditional diet—boiled whole fish or soup made from chicken parts. That would give you a fourth to a half a grain of thyroid daily. The government removed thyroid from the meat supply in the 1940s.

**Danny Roddy:** I've been saying this wrong for 10 years regarding grains. A Cynoplus tablet is about 12.5mcg T3 and 50mcg T4. A fourth of a Cynoplus is a little more than half a grain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Close to that. The original Armour thyroid ratio was close to 3:1 (T4:T3). They standardized it by biological effect on mice, not by measuring T4/T3 content.

## Education and The Digital World

**Danny Roddy:** We have a listener question from Sheila regarding remote learning and the future of education.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the thing is to work on getting the alignment back to the human concept of education. Everything is being standardized out of normal human reality via computers. If you accept it, you're strengthening an irrational system. Everyone has to start rejecting digital education and artificial intelligence.

**Georgi Dinkov:** I heard a theory that masks are an attempt to monopolize human interaction online.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they herd everyone onto their computers, they not only know what everyone is doing, but they can weed out the ones who aren't doing it right. The factory system 200 years ago was a way of getting people under central control. Now, the shift to computer communication makes it impossible to have direct contact and organized unions.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you remember around 2006 when Google was developing VR? The founder said, "Who would want to live in this world? Look how terrible it is."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The World Economic Forum people have said human teachers do a low-quality job. They want a monopoly on the curriculum via AI. Schwab has said the sooner we destroy the legacy economy, the sooner people will realize how great it is to buy, study, and get treatment online.

**Danny Roddy:** Do you think Governor Cuomo is being used as a scapegoat to prevent the discovery of bigger crimes regarding the lockdowns?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He's a willing conspirator. I don't think he's a good person. If they can shift attention to his womanizing, that's a way to cover up the geriatric genocide at elderly care homes.

**Danny Roddy:** Ray, are you aware of "The Finders" CIA project?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, I met the guy, Petty. He contacted Blake College in 1964 offering buildings. It was a fraud; he wanted us to finance his project. He was definitely working for the CIA and was an absolute ball of sleaze.

## Loss of Smell and Serotonin

**Danny Roddy:** A question from Johan regarding the loss of smell and taste from COVID. Is this neurological damage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Colds and influenza have always affected taste and smell. Stress increases metallothionein protein, which binds zinc and copper. I think the loss of zinc is affecting the sensory apparatus. Zinc is an essential component of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which regulates sensitivity in nerve endings.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think elevated serotonin has something to do with it? COVID is associated with a moderate version of serotonin syndrome.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, one of the most frequent symptoms is diarrhea. Anti-serotonin agents like cyproheptadine have been helpful. The hyperventilation syndrome leads to the inability of platelets to transport serotonin, so they leak it, poisoning systems.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Does elevated serotonin have a direct neurotoxic effect contributing to the loss of smell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, and it increases the tendency to have blood clots and inflammation.

## Vaccine Escape and Long-term Effects

**Danny Roddy:** A question from Ruth: Have you heard Geert Vanden Bossche's theory of immune escape regarding the vaccines?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He's talking about the standard understanding of virology. If you use a vaccine in the midst of a pandemic, it naturally favors the mutant versions of the virus. He's asking why we aren't applying standard principles and stopping the use of these vaccines.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Do you think tumor-causing viruses are special, or just inhibiting respiration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's a gene transmitted by a bacterium or virus that creates intense inflammation. The proper approach is to use anti-inflammatory tools: high sugar, aspirin, progesterone, vitamin D, antihistamines.

**Georgi Dinkov:** Now that the mRNA vaccine is turning people into machines for producing this inflammatory spike protein, do you think that may lead to cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, very likely. The ACE2 protein is our major anti-inflammatory system. It destroys angiotensin. If you destroy the enzyme that destroys angiotensin (via the spike protein), that's the most dangerous thing you can do.

**Georgi Dinkov:** So basically, cancer here we come?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, all kinds of degenerative things. If people keep producing the spike protein, that will keep knocking out the anti-inflammatory system.
