So Dr. Peat, what do you think made cultures...

Okay, and we're live.

Hello, everybody.

Welcome.

We have Georgie and Mr. Raymond Peat on the line, and we are talking about Aristotle.

We were talking about forms matter, deep politics.

And so I'm not going to interrupt what we were talking about, but Georgie, go ahead.

Yeah, I was curious what Dr. Peat thinks made that specific parts of the world amenable

to such contradictory ideas, basically.

I mean, is it something in the way people saw the world in those different parts?

I mean, the way people saw reality in those different parts of the world?

Why would the Eastern Europe or like Eastern world be so amenable to change and so accepting

of change, while the Western world would be like, "Nope, we're firmly controlled.

That's the only theory that we accept is true."

Change must be happening everywhere.

Why would it take root in certain parts of the world and not others?

In the '50s, I was considering the Whorfian hypothesis that language, the structure of

language has evolved in remote history, that the structure of language contributes to that.

But I fairly quickly realized that cultural things such as the difference between Aristotle

and Plato in the available literature, when people were just barely starting to get literate.

The church was a force for literacy, and it happened that the Eastern Christian church

got the good Aristotle literature, and the West was influenced by Platonism.

So I still tend to think that there are slight differences from the structure of language.

There's a linguist at Stanford who is the contemporary Whorfian apologist.

I think that can be seen in the difference between English and German, for example, and

between, say, Chinese and Hindi.

Chinese has, through use, reduced the superstructure of grammatical form and depends greatly on

context.

I think that there's a noticeable difference between English and the older European languages

with more context dependence in English grammar.

Are you familiar with the ideas of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein?

Oh yeah.

The thing I liked about him was that he numbered his paragraphs instead of trying to make a

grand argument that progressed logically.

He simply made statements and numbered them because he believed that every statement implies

a metaphysical surrounding.

I had been studying Bertrand Russell and the linguistic philosophers who I saw as being

a way—not Russell, but the people who followed him and called themselves the language philosophers,

like John Wisdom.

I saw them as trying to sneak in the old Platonism entities, logical atomism, for example, which

was Russell's word for it.

Wittgenstein blew that up and showed somewhat a resonance with the old Leibniz, a universe

being implied in every statement or every event implying the surrounding context.

The thing that made the most impression on me is that he said there's no such thing

as private language.

There are no private thoughts that can all be expressed and there are no private fields,

as you said in many of your interviews.

Yeah, but when you try to work out the implications of "there is no private language," you're

always guessing statistically that you're understanding the other person.

If you can't remember for sure, your own language is consistent and testable.

When you look at the other person, you're just making a statistically sounder guess,

but there's no essential difference between shared language and the private language once

you realize that they all depend on memory and interpretation.

Okay.

Wow, that's pretty interesting.

That leads me to the next question.

You had a discussion with Daniel about Lenin, memory, and matter.

You said, "Well, Lenin said that knowledge is memory and it's coming from matter, but

it's not matter, right?

Matter is everything we don't know.

So what is knowledge then?

I mean, if it's not matter, what is knowledge?"

It's the physiological presence of matter and the info is the matter itself that hasn't

been incorporated into our perspective.

Okay.

So would you say that knowledge is simply the structure of matter that we incorporate

into ourselves?

Yeah.

It's living matter and it's always open to living a new phase and that openness to new

life is matter.

Okay.

Info is all we can say about matter.

Understood.

It's not denying the materiality.

It's saying that this is the living matter that is our consciousness and that's like

an internal fountain in effect.

It's always going on, going ahead, becoming something else.

And that's the nature of matter, that it's creating this constant flow of knowledge.

Okay.

So in another interview, I think again with Danny, you basically said that nothing is

stored, right?

Basically how we feel about our memories and knowledge in general depends largely on thyroid

function and metabolism in general.

So if knowledge isn't stored, I mean, where is it?

Like when we access a memory, so to speak, what does that process physiologically look

like?

It's some trace in our facial muscles, viscera, posture.

We work through a series of reinventions, finding these pictures, which are arrangements

of excitations.

We don't go straight to a picture, we work by inference and traces to reconstruct it.

And so every time we bring up the past, we're creating a new past.

Okay.

So basically, so when we're remembering, we're partially recreating the memory.

Yeah.

It's always newly experienced.

The idea that something is stored becomes part of that Platonist idea that it ends up

saying that atoms are timeless entities and can be accurately described only by changeless

units of logic.

You can't let change into the system if you're in that logical atomism range all the way

to Platonism.

Platonism is denying that an individual atom has a history, for example.

The memory as reconstruction is that we're like a whirlwind of consciousness, but the

shape of our individual whirlwind is always ongoing, but is moving ahead with some degree

of deduction from our previous states.

And looking back, it's like a reverse deduction to reconstruct that we must have experienced

that being where we are.

And probably one of those same conversations we were talking about, I was asking you some

philosophical questions and you said something like you have to start and end with being

an animal.

And I think you said something like an animal reality.

Can you talk about that a little bit, because I found that to be pretty interesting.

Yeah, where an animal experiencing nature around it or people is aware of its needs

and hopes and also any fears that it has.

It interprets particular objects or processes as either hopeful or fearsome, and otherwise

it's in the process of going through the present situation with the intention of finding

the realization of what it wants.

And people have, the culture has piled up belief and stories that complicate that so

that we don't see ourselves as surrounded by future and dangers, future possibilities

and threats.

And I think anytime you're going to get back on the track of realizing yourself, the larger

intention, the thing that religious people feel as some kind of overarching meaning for

the animal, the human, hopefully biologically amplified animal doing things that some animals

can't do.

By our energy amplification, we can have the animal intentionality encompassing future

possibilities on a transpersonal scale, seeing the need for the ecosystem and for the society,

for other individuals, even for different kinds of organisms, taking responsibility

in a straight line with yourself, feeling that you're responsible for all of the stuff

around you, that you see it all as hopeful moving towards the future and don't have

any of these cultural kinks that say, "I own this," or "I have to destroy this

to do this," and so on.

You try to picture overarching series of meanings so that everything can get into a better future.

Are you saying, sorry, are you saying that amplified rate of metabolism coexists with

a sense of solidarity with other humans or the Kropotkin mutual aid, assuming your basic

needs are met?

Yeah.

I see Kropotkin blending in with Vernadsky, Vernadsky saying that the flow of energy from

the sun into the earth is trying, the substance responding to that flow of energy is creating

a living structural system that is assimilating and accumulating the interactions of the different

levels of the ecosystem, permitting the optimizing the metabolism of the big animal developing

a big brain and doing the things that are appropriate, like animals tearing through

the jungle are improving the fertility of the system, not damaging it.

Like Alan Savory, his rough idea is compatible with Vernadsky, that the big animals are a

big part of the ecosystems that they develop in and they are pulling, helping to pull the

whole ecosystem forward.

Because there's such massive energy dissipating structures?

Yeah.

Okay.

So, on the being an animal in this world, are you referring to basically Pavlov's ideas

of the first and second signal system?

The first one being, first signal system being basically the animal raw perception of reality?

Yeah, I don't see it as being strictly second.

The first signal system, P.K.

Anokhin, who was a colleague younger than Pavlov, developed the picture of the consciousness

in this unified sense.

He called it the acceptor of action, which you can't really separate the orienting reflex

or the dominant concept from the acceptor of action.

It's the present state of the organism in pictorial space-filling model of the world.

The second signal system, in Pavlov's term, gets its structure by acting as names for

structures in this acceptor of action, like you have a little three-dimensional holographic

movie going on with your intentions cycling through this movie model of the world.

The words, the second signal system, attaches to each part of the model of the world, has

a naming relationship.

Marx or Engels referred to it as a name of a ghost.

The second signal system gets its structure exclusively from this pictorial model of the

world, the acceptor of action.

To me, the way I understood your book, at least, was that intuition was part of the

first signal system, and then this capacity for rigid, analytical, abstract thought felt

like it didn't even need images.

That was part of the second signal system.

And then the authoritarian mind and people with authoritarian tendencies tend to really

emphasize the second signal system, in other words, purely abstract thought without any

connection to reality, to the first signal system.

Yeah, I did.

When I was studying psychology at the university, I did a survey asking people how they dreamed,

as well as their waking thought processes.

And I found that there were people who didn't know what it was to dream in pictures.

They said a dream was like listening to someone tell a story.

And those people were on a scale of creativity.

They would be absolute zero.

They followed verbal rules.

Somehow they could talk to people and seem to communicate in English.

They had no ability to think with any innovation.

It was only what could be said in a familiar way.

And when your acceptor of action is de-energized, it tends to disappear, leaving just these

solidified units of language.

You can't learn a language without having some fluidity in this model of the world.

But by the age of six or seven, people are often losing enough biological energy that

they start seeing reality in terms of only the cliches that they can say.

This might be semi off the topic, but where does personal responsibility, but also the

destruction of the individual from the culture, where does personal responsibility begin where

a person is born into a culture that basically sets them up for total failure?

We're going to talk about vaccines, but when I went home to Southern California, probably

a few years ago, my mom gave me a sheet of all the vaccines I got when I was a little

kid and it was like a ridiculous, I don't remember, it was like 20.

I know that's even worse now.

It just seems like, and I know you talked about with, what was his name, Guillermo,

but how the universe is expanding and growing, but our society is kind of declining at the

same time.

Yeah, you can see biological decline.

I looked at the birth weight of different nations and the head size, and for much of

the 19th and 20th century, birth weights and brain sizes were increasing steadily.

In 1980, several countries had an actual shrinkage of brain size or a growth in height with no

growth in brain from decade to decade.

So the cultural imposition really is literally shrinking people's brains now.

I just read a few days ago, like Generation Z has a pretty high suicide rate and doesn't

look good.

75% of them are actually, apparently have mental illness.

They meet the diagnostic criteria, as fake as it is, for at least one mental illness,

according to the American Psychiatric Association.

This is like the youngest generation that's just entering, not the workforce, but they're

in high school now.

I think that kind of information has to get through to the people who own and run the

world that their machine is breaking down.

If they really take their ownership seriously, that they want to keep their wealth, they'd

better start repairing the mechanism because the components are deteriorating too fast.

Are there any grassroots kind of movements that you think have potential for really changing

things?

Like how likely is it that something from the top is going to change everything, like

kind of the elite psychopath type of people?

I think it is most likely that it will be some disaster that forces it.

What was the Diane Fossier, the degrowth thing?

She thought like we would have to go through a primitive state or go back to a primitive

state?

I don't think it's possible to get back to any kind of a good primitive state, but I

think some kind of a big shock is going to have to happen before people, like people

fearing Elizabeth Warren's policy suggestions and simply ruling out people like that.

Both parties are committed to destroying the world.

So unless people start dismantling, preferably the Democratic Party, since there are still

people who remember that there used to be policies connected with the party, dismantling

that seems like a possible route to the future.

I wanted to backtrack a little bit on the verbal system.

I don't know, Dr. Peter, are you familiar with this sign/symptom/pathology in psychiatry?

They call it Logorare.

Basically, it's almost like it literally means verbal diarrhea.

And I stumbled upon it a few weeks ago, and when I looked into it, older studies show

that it's basically overwhelmingly connected to a number of psychiatric conditions that

are known to be driven by excess estrogen and serotonin.

And so my question is, do you think that this excessive verbalism, that essentially estrogen

and serotonin are partly mediating that?

And also, do you think that if somebody is in a culture that's excessively over-verbalized,

eventually it can lead to such pathologies itself?

Women in general produce many more words per minute than men on average.

Starting at the menstrual phase, when estrogen is highest, they can't stop talking.

And I think that involves a short circuit of the pictorial, space-filling thought and

directing the energy through these repetitive verbal patterns.

Very easy to make, not conforming to any practical use.

The thing about the acceptor of action, the pictorial model of the world, is that it's

always changing.

There's nothing repeated.

Anything you try to do twice, it's always different the second time.

The word consciousness, the estrogen-driven, lubricated word machine doesn't get any newness

admitted.

It's always repeating, tending to be cliched, and rehashing things that have already been

built into the system.

In one of your older interviews, you mentioned that you try to spend at least one day a week

not really uttering any words, or reading, and just painting and doing non-verbal activities.

You must be thinking that it's beneficial to do it if you're doing it on purpose.

I'm guessing my question is, do you think that excessive verbalization, when it's voluntary,

it can basically be detrimental?

Not if you keep your energy up.

When I had to teach 12 hours a week, different classes, after just two or three weeks, my

verbal fluency went up tremendously just because I was exercising that.

But I never repeated any idea twice through the whole series of lectures.

If you keep your energy up, you can verbalize fairly fluently, but always bending the message

a little so there's nothing repeated.

People always remark how, on KMUD, when Andrew asks you to introduce yourself, you'll change

it basically every single time.

Are you saying that's the result of keeping the energy up, or are you consciously trying

to recreate your history in all the things you've done?

I never have the same history twice.

A friend had a TV program, and she wanted to do some hour interviews.

She was an experienced TV person, so she would run through a trial program and then say she

wanted to do it again, but I would give different answers every time.

She finally gave up and realized that it was always going to be different answers.

But that's just the way I see the question.

The question never looks the same the second time.

Well, Karen told me probably five or more years ago, she's like, "Danny, something you

have to understand about Ray is when you try to put him in a box, he's going to immediately

want to get out."

So, that made a big...

Or won't even get out.

Yeah, exactly.

But I'm saying, is that a unique aspect of your personality, or do you think that's a

metabolic thing of trying to always stay in a creative mindset or something about your

history?

I first noticed it when I was, I think, three years old and helping my father with a repetitive

task.

I realized that every time I repeated the task, I was a new person.

And ever since then, I've never been able to have the illusion of doing something twice.

And that's then...

If that's the case, then don't you think that schools are really harmful because they emphasize

this routine at every step of the educational process, both the elementary schools, the

high schools, and the universities.

They really don't like you being different every single time.

Yeah, if a person let them be tortured constantly, but you just have to be quiet and let them

do their thing.

I feel like one of the worst parts about school was sitting down.

And now learning about restraint stress and things like that, that seems part of the...

I remember just feeling like it was torture sitting down for so long all day.

It's awful.

Yeah.

My only concern is that you once said that faint stupidity becomes real stupidity.

So I guess a person just has to be sitting there and hoping that they're not going to

be stuck in the educational system long enough to become an idiot like all the other people

being turned into slaves, mental slaves.

Yeah, people who did IQ tests on New York City, every year they gave the same students

more IQ tests and found that every year their IQ went down.

Wow.

Have you also seen the studies showing that the earlier a child starts school, basically

the dumber they will exit the whole educational system?

I hadn't seen that, but that would be the same principle.

I have two sisters and I don't think either of them watch this, but the one that didn't

go to college I can talk normally with.

And then the one that did go to college, we don't have very much in common.

So I've definitely seen that played out.

Ray, do you think the vaccinations, besides the food and the polyunsaturated fats, you

see that as a major kind of problem for society?

Yeah.

I mean, until fairly recently, I hadn't realized that kids are now getting 50 shots by the

time they grow up.

Robert Kennedy Jr. mentioned that until 1980, only 2.5%, I think, of kids, he said, had

allergies.

Starting in the 1980s, I think he said it was over half of the kids now have serious

allergies.

And if you want to create an allergy in an animal, you give it an injection.

Intramuscular is ideal to include some little thing like an egg protein or milk protein

or any of the various proteins that are in the culture media that they make vaccines

in.

So they are replicating animal allergy creation every time they give a shot.

There's no way to deny it sensibly.

I think on one of our conversations, you said the background for vaccines was related to

what, like the Rockefeller Foundation and trying to keep workers active.

But now, do you think they take on a different meaning nowadays?

Yeah, I think the money, tremendous money, billions of dollars, 50 billion a year, I

think it is profits, mostly profits from the sale of just vaccines.

I don't know if Dr. Peat has seen the news, but I was shocked to see CNN last week, putting

a headline news that basically said, "CDC is warning.

It's not a question of if, but when coronavirus will create a massive epidemic in the United

States."

And I thought to myself, why would a health agency issue such a statement?

And then why would a major news media publish it?

Isn't that like the exact opposite what a government should be doing?

Like scaring all of its citizens and not really providing any answers.

They're just saying it will be bad and be very afraid.

Yeah, but the CDC, I don't know what the average is, but over the last, I think at least 15

years, they say that the annual deaths produced by influenza, and I think they're all coronavirus

influenza, that's just the standard category that produces influenza.

They have been saying, I think it ranges from 9 million deaths per year in the United States

to a high of 57 million deaths from influenza per year.

That's worldwide?

Now they expect us to get excited when a dozen people die.

I was trying to think of all the swine flu, SARS, bird flu, Zika virus, is the difference

between all these things.

It seems like, I was talking about it with Georgie before I got on the phone with you,

Ray.

I have a Twitter application on my phone.

So when I do turn on my phone, the application of Twitter, there is a new huge bar on the

screen just updating me on coronavirus.

But I've never, the application has changed to give me updates that I've never asked for

on coronavirus.

And it just seems like the marketing campaign is palpable, very, very strong.

Yeah, and the World Health Organization is sharing in the corruption, conflicts of interest.

So you can't trust any of the big organizations because they manage to profit in some way

from the huge amount of wealth that's being directed through the vaccines.

I have a question about viral resilience in general.

I was reading some older studies and they were all showing that basically the more hydrophilic

the cell is, the greater its susceptibility to a viral infection.

And then I thought, okay, so doesn't that suggest that the presence of polyunsaturated

fats in the blood would increase susceptibility to the virus?

And unsurprisingly or surprisingly, there are quite a few studies published before the

1950s that made that exact same claim, that if you have high levels of unsaturated fats

in the blood, they will increase the affinity of the cell for water and also for these viral

particles.

But if the level of free fatty acids in the blood are low, then cells were extremely resilient

to even lethal viruses like the rabies.

Yeah, that whole subject, polyunsaturated fats, it's worse than any organized crime

campaign.

Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats are gigantic criminal businesses and the omega-3 fats are

especially powerful in immune suppression, but they market that as being anti-inflammatory.

Right.

So my question was like basically, wouldn't something as simple as taking some aspirin

and niacinamide essentially greatly reduce the risk of catching any viral infection?

Yeah, I think so.

And aspirin happens to be an antiviral agent in itself, antibacterial and antiviral.

And there was a study, I think around Washington, DC, that tested it on AIDS patients, just

big doses of aspirin and it was working, but no one was interested.

I actually met, I live in DC and I met one of the people who were involved in the study

and he refuses to talk about it.

Basically the statement was, the question is too political.

And I said, "Well, I've seen the study.

You guys claim that it was terminated because there was a rise in the levels of the liver

enzymes in the aspirin group."

And he said, "Yeah, that was the official story, but that's not why it was stopped."

And when I asked why it was stopped, he said, "It's way above my pay grade."

I mean, meaning mine, not his.

Ray, one of the papers you had cited in one of your articles, the Persaud paper, and they

say, "It is perhaps surprising that essential lipids that are supposed to be so good for

health are so potent at killing cells."

So yeah, just supporting what you're talking about.

And then you on your HIV article were referencing papers that those people had high levels of

PUFA in their blood.

And it's something I had never even heard of anywhere else.

Yeah, immunodeficiency is a big thing apart from any virus.

Sepsis has been growing along with other degenerative diseases, but young people never used to get

sepsis practically.

But now sepsis is affecting younger and younger people in bigger numbers.

And I think it's largely the stress cumulative effects on PUFA.

Well, something that's popular among my group of friends is the idea of herd immunity.

Do you want to speak about that?

I think that's why people are scared.

And my freedom-loving friends, the best of them would still want other people to forcefully

get vaccinations because they fear for their own safety.

And so do you want to maybe speak if you know where that idea stemmed from and then how

it does not fit into your biological and physiological picture?

It sounds very much like a Nazi program.

It doesn't have any convincing weight for me.

It just makes me fear the people that say we're a herd that has to be treated one way

or another.

Have you seen any of that movie Vaxxed?

They talk about the military vaccinating people and creating Gulf War syndrome with the anthrax

vaccine.

Well, I hadn't read that specifically, but Diana Dutton wrote a book called Worse Than

Disease where she kind of details the swine flu.

And it was kind of similar to what you said earlier about coronavirus.

Like the problem didn't kill very many people, but the vaccine caused tons of problems.

Yeah, one guy was routed out of bed to go on a forced march and collapsed while marching

and died shortly after, and he was diagnosed as having swine flu.

He was the only death acknowledged by the head of the CDC from swine flu.

But I forget the exact number, but there were thousands of paralytic reactions, and I think

it was around 300 deaths from the vaccine.

So hundreds of times worse than the disease.

You say in your newsletter, if a vaccine hasn't produced swelling, fever, anaphylaxis, shock,

paralysis, or death, within two months, it is safe.

Or the public health view, it seems to be that if a vaccine hasn't produced swelling,

which is just crazy.

Yeah, I wanted to mention something about HIV.

Dr. Peat may have seen that study.

I think it came out around 2014.

Of course, it didn't hit mainstream media, but it showed that, at least the authors claimed

that you cannot develop AIDS if you're HIV positive.

So you cannot develop AIDS unless there's high levels of endotoxin in your blood.

And then there was a subsequent study, I think in 2018, which showed that the single most

reliable predictor of death of all-cause mortality in HIV positive people was this level of this

protein called soluble CD14.

It's abbreviated SCD14, and that is the most reliable biomarker of endotoxin levels in

the blood.

And for some reason, I never see virologists talk about the role of endotoxin in viral

disease and multi-organ failure and in septic shock.

Well, in reality, it seems like all of these things are directly caused by endotoxin.

Yeah, I'm inclined to think that even cancer is largely an endotoxin problem.

Chronic year after year of bad food irritating the intestine, causing increased histamine

and serotonin and estrogen, but a constant stream of endotoxin flowing through the system,

shaking up chromosomes, creating inflammation, fatiguing the repair systems.

Finally, when the repair systems are down to a certain extent, the cancers that are

constantly popping up stop being removed.

And so if you don't die of acute sepsis, then heart disease and cancer, I think, are the

result of chronic exposure to the endotoxin.

So would you say the specific organ or tissue where the cancer appears, the apparently localized

nature, even though we know it's a systemic problem, the apparently localized nature is

simply because that particular organ or tissue was the most energetically compromised.

That's why it took a hold there.

Yeah.

When I've mentioned the idea of systemic disease to cancer doctors or patients, they really

have a hard time, just can't grasp.

They've been so indoctrinated with the idea that it's a clone that develops one single

mutant cell develops into the clone.

And so it's by definition the most localized thing conceivable.

It's platonically localized.

But way back 80 or 90 years, people have been seeing precancerous gradations surrounding

any tumor.

If you look at all of the signs of stem cell signals, all of the inflammatory cytokines,

disturbed chromosome balance, all of those things are increased in a gradient.

The field concept of cancer goes way back 200 years almost, but it just hasn't been

acceptable because of this platonistic genetic determinism, clonal descent of each tumor.

Have you seen the study that came out in 2015?

Basically made huge waves across the oncology community, if there is such a thing.

And it basically said for over a hundred years, we've been wrong.

We've been calling it the Warburg effect, but now it seems that the effect is the cause

as well.

In other words, metabolic disturbances and specifically lactic acid precede the genomic

abnormalities that are seen in cancer cells and actually the cause of them, not the other

way around.

Yeah.

Lactic acid creates a reduced state, shift the balance towards increased sulfhydryl,

NADH ratio to NAD, and all of the electronic and energetic properties of cancer are initiated

just by putting a lot of lactic acid into the system.

Yeah.

I was just, I saw, I mean, it was posted on one of the biggest social media sites and

you could see doctors chiming in and some of them being panicky and saying, "Oh my

God, if this is true, it means in my practice as an oncologist, I've been killing people."

And others are saying, "Well, it's too early.

Let's see genetics.

We haven't heard the last of genetics yet.

Let's give genetics a chance.

Maybe we'll find a way to treat it genetically."

But overall the mood was, well, it was pessimistic for the oncologist, but the general public

that was reading this thread and responding seemed to be pretty ecstatic because people

immediately caught on the fact that if cancer is metabolic and it's this continuous field,

then it can probably be reversed.

You don't need to subject yourself to this torture that your oncologist is giving you

and likely killing you.

There are other ways.

And the doctors were heavily arguing against it in that same thread saying, "No, people,

if you choose the metabolic route, you'll be killing yourselves.

You're signing your death warrants.

You should stay with a traditional therapist because until we know more."

Did you ever read Max Gerson's book?

I think it's called 59 Cases.

He, coffee enemas were one of his staples.

He generally gave people thyroid and tried to get their metabolism towards oxidative

energy production.

But cleaning the intestine was probably his single most effective thing.

Even if he sometimes had an old person who was very debilitated, he would sometimes give

them a coffee enema every hour around the clock.

Get them out of bed to wash their intestine again.

He actually cured numerous advanced cases of cancer documented with photographs.

I think chronically keeping the endotoxin down gives the recuperative system a great

chance.

So that would explain largely why recent studies with the tetracycline and the biotics, especially

doxycycline, are reporting such remarkable effects.

Yeah.

In 1965, which was the first time, some doctor sent me an argument that he was curing cancer

with antibiotics.

I didn't at that time think of it in terms of cutting out the endotoxin, but people have

been doing it repeatedly over several decades.

I have to send you a press release from Harvard University, I think it's from early '90s.

It's about a lady that ran a cancer lab there.

The news article was a popular press article.

It said, "Doctor Johnson is capable of curing mice of lethal leukemia every time she wants

to."

How does she do that?

By giving them tetracycline.

Then immediately the question is, "Why can't this be done in people?"

She said, "Because it's not FDA approved."

I thought to myself, "What a stupid excuse.

What is the antibiotic going to do to these terminally ill people?

What, kill them?"

I mean, they're dying anyways.

Why not try something that's already approved for usage in people and it's known to be relatively

safe?

Why do we have to wait on the bureaucracy to give us approval to live?

Why can't this be tried by good natured doctors?

I've known doctors who were declared imminently dying in hospital and they wanted to try something

on their own.

The supervising doctors took their stuff away from them, wouldn't let experiment, even though

they were said to have only 48 hours left to live, they couldn't experiment on themselves.

Yeah, I remember there was a neurologist who got a neuroglial dystoma and he started injecting

himself with some kind of a virus or bacteria to give himself fever because he read that

fever sometimes cured cancer.

He was immediately declared mentally unfit.

They basically committed this doctor who used to work in this hospital, they locked him

up in his own hospital and let him, he died like a few weeks later.

There have been a couple of studies in which people, they accidentally noticed that women

who were given an antibiotic course, among other things, they recovered from their headaches,

but they did blood tests and found that before the antibiotic, they had high estrogen and

cortisol and low progesterone and after the course of antibiotics, their progesterone

went up and both cortisol and the estrogen went down, both of which would favor recovery

from cancer.

The cortisol is weakening your immune processes, for example, and estrogen is stimulating the

cell growth.

In rats, same thing was observed.

A course of antibiotics lowers cortisol and estrogen and increases progesterone and so

the coffee enema or the antibiotic or a high fiber diet, all of those things are actually

remedying your hormone situation.

Did you know that cortisol is given to pretty much any cancer patients as kind of like a

standard treatment?

Along with morphine.

And morphine, yes.

And morphine increases histamine release.

Histamine is a powerful tumor promoter, so they usually adjust the dose so that they're

dead before they notice that the tumor has grown faster.

I just never cease to amaze me.

The explanation of the doctors, because I used to work in a medical field, was that

well, the patient has inflammation in edema and we need to reduce it with a cortisol and

I thought, "Aren't there other safer anti-inflammatory methods?"

Because even as ignorant as some doctors are, some of them do know that cortisol does not

seem to be helping the tumor patients.

They're almost using it because by definition, that's the powerful anti-inflammatory they

have on file and they have to use it.

Ray, would you put Paul Ehrlich in the pantheon of people that have ruined science?

So Weissman, Paul Ehrlich.

And Ehrlich was the same guy that did the estrogen receptor stuff, is that right?

He popularized the whole idea of lock and key receptor specificity.

That whole receptor idea is perfect for selling chemicals.

Every chemical can have a receptor and so it's perfect for the chemical industry.

And the holistic, ongoing whirlwind picture of the organism where, for example, a large

dose of a chemical can have an opposite effect of a small dose.

Those contradictory anti-receptor pictures are no good for the chemical industry.

I have a question about the whole receptor thing.

I'm sure you've probably noticed this yourself, but I looked at all of the hormones that are

currently known and then I also looked at the receptor and the receptor structure.

There is a significant overlap in terms of the amino acid sequence and the structure

of the various receptors.

So even though, let's say, a pharmaceutical company may claim that they've developed this

extremely selective, say, estrogen agonist, if you go back and look at the other studies

done by other groups, you'll see invariably that the substance that they claim is extremely

selective is invariably acting on other receptors as well.

So my question is, is it even possible to develop a truly selective receptor compound

given that the various receptors have so much overlap?

No, I don't think so.

The whole idea of receptors derives from Ehrlich and I think it's right down to its foundation,

Karep.

Szent-Györgyi reviewed in one of his books ideas that Pavlov was familiar with around the turn

of the century.

The idea that the dose determines the effect, like a small amount of caffeine is sedative,

a large amount is stimulating, and even larger amount is narcotic.

And the dose of a sedative, a small dose will be a stimulant, a larger dose a sedative.

And the typical curve has been tested on hundreds of different substances and it consistently

contradicts the idea of a specific receptor doing a specific thing.

The only way you can imagine that three-phase curve working is if you think of the cell

as substance or characteristic qualities and substance.

You have to think as something which can move from one phase to another, potentially a series

of phase, each phase having a characteristic behavior.

So the differentiation occurs in the cytoplasm as a whole and that state of the cytoplasm

evokes the expression or stabilizes the expression of the genes that are appropriate for that

state.

And by thinking in terms of physical states, you can visualize the quantity as reaching

a threshold of cooperative phase transition happens when many things work in the same

direction.

So basically the whole idea of using one substance that will work in only one particular way,

it's hopeless.

I mean, basically the organism doesn't work like that.

You can create the illusion that it does by setting conditions just exactly right and

then you can get the apparent specific interaction and reaction, but it's a purely artificial

setup.

Have you seen the recent news about the resurgence of estrogen, of hormone replacement therapy

with estrogen in menopausal women?

They're trying to kind of put down all the findings of the Women's Health Initiative

study and try to reintroduce estrogen as therapy.

Yeah, in 1973 or '74, I saw a resurgence and about every five or ten years, the actual

science makes a little headway.

The big headway was the Women's Health Initiative and within five years, the people at Stanford

were instrumental in explaining why estrogen didn't really cause cancer, strokes, heart

attacks and so on and their favorite explanation is it's really progesterone.

And originally, estrogen was recognized as doing certain things to the organism and they

identified the estrogen receptor as a major way that it does that even though hypoxia

in the absence of estrogen will cause the receptor to behave the same.

Estrogen creates hypoxia and activates the estrogen.

Hypoxia alone will do it if something else creates it.

When they needed to explain away that estrogen does everything that it does, they discovered

the estrogen receptor beta and it turns out that almost everything that estrogen doesn't

do, the beta does, it stops growth, stops all of the characteristic estrogen behaviors

and pretty much parallels the actions of progesterone and progesterone now is divided into an A

and B receptor.

The A receptor is activated by estrogen and it activates the progesterone B but they're

just thinking wildly of ways that they can say that progesterone is responsible for all

of the bad stuff that has been blamed on estrogen.

I emailed one of the authors of one of the big papers that's now calling for reintroduction

of estrogen as therapy for women and I said, "How can we ignore all this science?

I mean that's pretty much indisputable that estrogen is carcinogenic."

There is actually a page posted on the website of the National Institutes of Health which

officially defines and declares estrogen as a carcinogen and a mutagen and I said, "Well,

your own organization," I think basically that person either used to work or works at

NIH, I said, "Your own organization says that estrogen is this dangerous chemical."

He said, "Well, estrogen has non-genomic effects that are actually beneficial and if

we give it at lower dosages, it acts as a powerful antioxidant that will remove the

need for people to take vitamin E and C and it will give them all the benefit for heart

protection without actually having the carcinogenic effects."

Are you still there, Georgie?

Oh no, did we lose Ray?

Maybe we did.

Okay.

Seems like he's there.

Maybe let me hang up, call him back.

Okay, Ray, you're not there, right?

Okay, I'm going to hang up, call him back.

These things happen.

I was afraid you were frozen too.

I was like, "I'm going to really..."

Because I never move and never see anything.

I was going to be like, "Oh man, I have a serious problem if everything just froze.

That would be really not good."

I think I finally bored Ray to death and he's like, "I'm done with this.

You guys keep talking."

Okay, let me...

Unable to add participant is unavailable.

Is it busy?

Does that mean it's giving business signal or something?

Maybe.

I wonder if he's trying to call back the number, which would, I think, be impossible.

I don't know.

We'll see.

Okay, everybody, thank you so much.

I think we have like 250 people.

This is obviously the most people we've ever had on here, so that is heartwarming.

I never wanted to get Ray on until I felt real comfortable with the mechanics of the

live stream stuff.

So, I feel more comfortable with it.

I'm happy to have this happen.

It's everything I ever dreamed of.

Thanks Georgie and massive thanks to Ray.

Let me call him back again.

I wonder if there's a time limit on the show.

Ray, you're back.

Okay.

We lost you for a second.

I didn't hear when it went dead.

I don't know either, Georgie.

Do you remember when we lost Ray?

It was kind of like a strange...

I thought my whole computer froze, but it didn't.

No, I was talking about the reintroduction of estrogen.

I was talking to one of the authors of a big study that came out this year and I emailed

him and I said, "How can you argue that estrogen is good considering that your own organization,

I think that person works for the NIH, has a webpage which says estrogen is a carcinogen

and a mutagen.

So, why would you argue that estrogen needs to be reintroduced and given to women?"

And he said, "Estrogen has non-genomic effects that don't involve the estrogen receptor and

acts as a powerful antioxidant.

So, if we give it to women in the right dosage, they will obviate the need for them to take

massive doses of vitamin E and C and it will provide them with this benefit of cardiovascular

protection and everything that these great antioxidants do."

So, I said, "So, how can you prevent estrogen from activating these receptors that you know

are causing cancer?"

And he basically said, "It's the dosage that makes the poison."

So, they're thinking that lower dose estrogen, it's going to be beneficial.

And I remember you said in several of these letters that a continuous uninterrupted exposure

to a low dose of estrogen is probably more harmful than getting estrogen spikes like

every few days or every few weeks.

Yeah, that was Alexander Lipschutz from about 1938 through the 1940s.

He did many animal experiments showing that even very small doses of estrogen, unless

they were interrupted with progesterone, were carcinogenic not just to the uterus and breast

but to the lungs, kidneys, brain, every organ would eventually develop estrogen-induced

cancer.

Well, if estrogen is, I mean, if cancer is a state of chronic reductive stress and estrogen

is a powerful reductant itself, doesn't that almost guarantee that estrogen will at the

very least contribute to an already established cancer?

Yeah, I don't know of any case where it doesn't.

To change gears a little bit, Ray, I feel like you're getting more popular on YouTube

and Twitter and things and people say all sorts of things about why you do what you

do.

And so, maybe we could just take a second to say like, why do you do what you do?

Just from your own words because so many people just basically make up things.

And so, I was just curious about your position on that.

Part of my understanding of what I'm doing here in the world, checking ideas and looking

for new perspectives, checking what people believe and trying to avoid the bad interpretations

that lead to bad actions and results.

It's always part of the same process of looking for something to do.

And maybe just an elevator pitch of your general hypothesis, like what you say on the front

of your webpage, the idea that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

I made a video about this not fairly recently, but it's like, because the nutrition world

is so stuck on different diets, obviously this whole conversation is about how complex

everything is, but your work gets reduced down to kind of a caricature of like you drink

two gallons of milk and two gallons of orange juice and a bag of sugar and then you're doing

your "Ray Peat Diet".

So, what is your perspective of what maintains health and then what is the differentiator

into the state of sickness?

There are two simple choices.

One that the genes have been laid out, have created a blueprint for creating the structures

and all the energy has to do is help to roll those out and once they're in place, just

to keep them running.

Like, that orientation leads to the idea that the less you live, the longer you will live.

The idea that you're going to burn up your, the whole apparatus will wear out the faster

you use it.

That all comes from the reductionist idea of a machine laid out in genetic blueprints.

It's a machine powered by a Rube Goldberg system, which is 20th century science.

And the other picture is the developmental picture that energy flowing from the sun through

the atmosphere is creating structures that the flow of energy itself generates structures

and the faster the energy flows, the more complex the structure becomes and the more

energy is saved in the system in the form of complexity of structure and the efficiency

increases, but the waste is part of what is powering it.

You don't have to think in terms of the efficiency of the system because the energy flowing through

the system, even though the oxidative apparatus is getting more efficient, you're building

a bigger system faster than the complexity and efficiency accumulates.

So it's the speed with which you can waste the energy while responding to it, building

your complexity that is holding up the whole structure.

And it's simply a picture of an ecosystem responding physically to energy.

It doesn't violate any of the known physical laws.

It uses them in more intelligent ways than the Rube Goldberg science of membranes, genes,

and so on.

And then you feel like you're following it, like this is not some idea that you cooked

up on your own.

Like you feel like you're following in a tradition of people like Szent-Györgyi, like Otto Warburg,

like Koch and others?

Yeah.

And even earlier, J.C.

Bose was one of my first inspirations.

I have a question.

Do you think that this openness to new ideas that these people had, it was sort of enabled

by their relatively faster metabolism?

And or do you think it was more or less childhood experiences that set them to be that way,

to be open to new opportunities and to actually actively seek them out?

I think a good intrauterine environment is a tremendous part of it.

You can, like Katharina Dalton's patients, the older kids, her patients had 95 average

IQ.

And just by treating the mothers with progesterone, her patients' kids had something like 135

average IQ.

The same mother, but better nourishment in utero.

And that kind of a head start gives you a lot of energy for absorbing shocks from the

oppressive environment.

Okay.

A question related to that, to expand a little bit on that, is, as I'm sure you're familiar,

sick people and sick animals tend to sort of retreat, avoid the real world and really

limit their spectrum of activity.

Some of them may even stop eating and basically they just want to keep to themselves and be

left alone.

Considering the fact that novelty and new experiences and being stimulated in the proper

way is so very therapeutic, do you think these sick organisms are making a pathological choice

that's not good for them based on their already poor health?

Or do you think it's actually a choice that at least in the short term, it's good for

them?

Basically, they don't have the energy to meet the demands of the world.

So they're retreating and hoping that they'll recover and then they'll come back.

Yeah.

Usually there's something specific that has happened.

They've eaten something or caught an infection, got poisoned and retreat and let the body

repair itself.

Paracelsus was one of the first people to put it into practice where he put his pharmacological

preparation on the sword that caused the wound and spared the patient the medication and

discovered that patients recovered much better without the medication.

Every time there's been an opportunity to compare medicated people with unmedicated,

the ones without medicine are much healthier.

So like animals, we could just take a week or two to retreat and maybe have a milkshake

now and then.

People would be much healthier, more likely to survive to old age.

So I guess initially it would be beneficial to retreat because you want to recover your

energetic resources, but do you think that over time if this becomes a chronic sort of

isolation self-imposed, that over time it actually becomes pathological, it starts to

hurt health because you've retreated so much from the world?

Yeah, there are people who do that, but they need new opportunities as well.

The culture isn't rushing to give them healthy, new, interesting opportunities.

In many cases, actually, they retreated because their doctor told them to.

It's, you know, they say, "Stay in your room until I call you and tell you it's okay to

get out."

To bring it back to politics a little bit, like, Ray, you think there's a way forward

with the kind of the system that we have at the moment?

Like you see glimmers of hope.

Like I remember when you were talking to Gavin for that interview on politics when Trump

had just been elected, like it seemed like, okay, this is different.

But then over time, he seems to have been absorbed into the same kind of stereotypical

problems of endless war and things like that.

But you do see a glimmer of hope in that whole system?

Do you know who Ann Coulter is?

I think of her as personification of Gooney reactionary philosophy.

But weirdly, she has made some of the most insightful comments about what's going on

now.

For example, comparing Bernie and Trump, she pointed out that the very things that

he campaigned on but didn't exactly fulfill, keeping us out of war, taxing the untaxed

corporations like Amazon and the banks, and stopping immigration.

Bernie has identical policies to what people were perceiving as Trump's campaign promises.

And she says that he is Trump's real threat.

And the polls, almost all of the polls are showing Bernie beating Trump by several points,

percentage points.

And most people in the public media, especially the Democrats, don't want to talk about that

possibility.

They think that the same people who saw a possibility in Trump avoiding war and taxing

the giant corporations, that's what they see in Bernie.

And so if he could run against Trump, then other realistic things then would be at issue.

Maybe Ann Coulter is espousing some of those, you introduced me to the term, but paleo-conservative

a little bit, some of those ideas?

Yeah, I don't know what really went through Ann Coulter's mind, but it was more perceptive

than I've seen any of the Democrat liberals doing.

Yeah, the paleo-conservatives are very consistent on avoiding war, but some of their policies

are really dopey.

Well, not to get too deep into a rabbit hole on this, but things like immigration and things,

I know there was, I forget the author, but it was like a book called Weapons of Mass

Migration.

And so this is not a topic I spend lots of time thinking about, but those types of things

to kind of influence the culture.

And I know the paleo-conservatives are against that, but again, I'm like reading Bucky Fuller

and him saying that there shouldn't be borders and things like that.

I agree with that type of view, but I'm also, I don't know, I'm torn between these different

points of view of migration and things.

And also being in a, living in different countries, it's not very easy to stay anywhere else aside

from Mexico or America.

Yeah, Bucky Fowler would say that the corollary is that you stop creating horror experiences

at home, like imposing a fascist on Honduras, where the elected president was improving,

he just wanted to raise the minimum wage and barely improve things, but definitely improving.

He was kicked out, Hillary Clinton oversaw putting a fascist in, and all of the progressive

labor people trying to get a minimum wage, they're being murdered, environmentalists

are being murdered.

And so obviously it's an improvement for them to try to get in the United States, but simply

stopping the oppression of third world countries would stop the immigration, improve conditions.

Hondurans would rather live in Honduras with a better standard of living than going to

the US and looking for work.

Erdogan and Turkey is following the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, allying with Al-Qaeda

and ending up creating more refugees and trying to send them to Europe to force Europe to

send an army in to give Syria to him.

If you simply stop supporting the murder and the oppression in places like Turkey and Honduras,

you would stop the immigration problem.

And that's from the imperialist US war machine.

Yeah.

I think it's more than the US involved here.

I think there are a number of imperialists in this world that are acting in concert with

the United States and often actually spearheading the war in certain places of the world, even

more than the United States.

I mean, Russia and Turkey, just as you said, Dr. Pied, and France and Germany, they all

have competing interests in the Middle East.

Israel, of course, Saudi Arabia, Iran.

So the United States gets a lot of the blame being the largest empire of them all, but

I think plenty of other countries that are at least as evil, and in this specific case,

probably even more so than the United States.

Just the number of soldiers maintained in other people's countries, the US is by far

the leader.

Yeah.

So I have a question for you.

I mean, given everything that we've talked about so far, and politicians getting elected

and then getting mired in the very swamp that they pledged to drain, and I've read history,

maybe definitely not as extensively as you, but I don't know of a single case of an empire

that got reformed.

Do you think that this empire or any empire can be reformed?

All I saw in history was empires either expanding, reaching their peak, and then either sort

of like gently fading into oblivion or collapsing almost overnight.

I never saw a case of a peaceful, semi-peaceful, or even constructive reform of an empire.

Yeah, I think theoretically, had that in mind, controlled collapse of the empire, withdrawing

the army more or less quickly, but the imperialists in the military, for example, don't want to

lose their power.

If Bernie could actually run against him, I think between them, they would possibly

recruit more supporters for bringing the empire down fairly quickly.

And what would that entail in your view, bringing down the empire?

Would it be simply end of the world wars that the military machine has started, or do you

mean a more radical social change at home?

If you freed up the Pentagon budget, for example, 90% of it putting the US on a scale with other

big countries, that amount of money removed from military destruction could far more than

finance any kind of Bernie Sanders programs, free college, health care for everyone, good

education, health care.

I just don't see the powers that be relinquishing that war machine, because that is the source

of their power.

And whoever gets elected, in my view, will be either undermined politically, or maybe

even worse.

Maybe this country has already seen an assassination of a president, and apparently, if you believe

other historical sources, attempted assassinations on other presidents that weren't playing ball.

I read the JFK, the unspeakable.

That gives a very close view of how Kennedy was backing off from the empire, and they

didn't want him to back off.

I think even Trump realizes that same mechanism being in action, and he has his own secret

service, for example.

The secret service pretty obviously was involved in killing Kennedy, and Trump knew enough

to have his own private security rather than the secret service.

So I didn't know that much about Trump leading up to the election, but his bailout from some

Rothschild family member, and then his close association with Sheldon Adelson, were there

clues that he was not going to follow through with what he was talking about?

Because he seems to be totally co-opted, and again, like you said, he's not doing the things

that he originally promised to do.

Yeah, he has repeatedly tried to sign the agreement with the Taliban.

Pompeo keeps sabotaging it, but Trump keeps going back and trying to keep the withdrawal

on schedule.

So I think more than anyone else in the government, he is making efforts to shut down the war

system.

And then how does somebody like Pompeo rise to power?

The guy is a total, like, total nut.

I just listen to some of his speaking, and it's just, I know it's nothing new, but it's

like shocking to even hear him talk about his kind of machinations and things about

what's going to happen in the future.

The Armageddon crowd was in Reagan's government too.

The Interior Minister said, "The end is near.

Let's mine it all.

Get it before the end."

Well, that really seems to be the premise they're all operating on, is that the end

is coming soon and nothing matters.

So that's why maybe that validates endless war and things like that.

That's literally true of a lot of those people like Pompeo.

Yeah, I wanted to tie in health and the collapse of the empire.

I mean, barring any kind of unpredictable collapse that the powers that be inflict on

themselves, if we want the reform, so to speak, or the control collapse to come from the people,

many of them, if not most, are in such a compromised state of health that they actually fear and

often actively oppose change.

At least that's my personal impression.

Don't you think this needs to be improved before some radical social change can actually

take hold?

Yeah, that's why I emphasize biology and health thinking to get people to realize that

they're dying on this path and that they have to change something radically.

To simply save their own health, they've got to change the system, which is pumping.

It isn't carbon dioxide.

It's a thousand different toxins being pumped into the atmosphere and food supply that is

killing people, vaccines and fake foods.

I think the movie Vaxxed and the various movements against genetically modified food and so on,

that's a wedge that people can start to see their own survival and their children depending

on bringing this industrial system to some kind of safe conclusion.

Okay.

In one of your first interviews with Danny, both of you were talking about panic and organizing

the panic.

That actually might have been carried.

Oh yeah.

But I think Dr. Peter opined on that as well.

So let's say the average person on the street, you give them all this information, they say,

"Okay, I see it in my own life.

I believe you.

I do understand that the system is killing me and I'm shaking with anxiety because I

don't know what to do."

What would be your response to a person like that?

Where do they start?

I think organizing, and that's exactly where the power system exists, is any impulse towards

organization gets interrupted.

All kinds of interruptions, firing them from their jobs so they don't have access to the

same resources.

New ways of organizing have to develop.

So do you think that the cultural push in the Western world towards extreme individualism

is a thinly veiled attempt at basically implementing this isolation so that people don't trust

each other and refuse to organize?

Yeah.

That's at the heart of preventing organization.

In the 1930s, there was a religious movement called moral rearmament.

That organization still exists, but it was a Christian movement with branches still in

this country and in Europe, religious reasons why you should destroy unions.

But it applies to any kind of social progress, making change that impinges on the corporations

and banks.

Right.

But at the same time, organized religion is probably a prime example of organization,

of getting people into groups and getting them to act upon a common goal.

So it could go either way, right?

If it's in the right hands, organization can be very powerful and impetus for change.

But if it gets compromised from within by agents of the powers that be and whatnot,

then people can be duped into sort of, they think they're working towards the common good,

but in reality, they're just maintaining the status quo.

The CIA and the FBI are several stages ahead of everyone organizing.

Anything you think of, they've got it covered.

Like Occupy Wall Street, they put organizers in who helped to prevent any constructive

organizational outcome, but they had snipers on the roof ready to kill the leaders if anyone

organized something that actually led to action.

Okay.

So what would be, I mean, I'm trying to, I guess, because regular people are aware of

that as well, many of them.

So they seem to have a choice between taking the risk at organizing and participating in

a group and then this group being undermined and they're working now, they're working in

favor of the empire versus avoiding participation in a bad activity, which you have also spoken

in favor of in the past, but then not really having enough power to enact change because

they're on their own.

Where is the, is there a middle ground or would it depend every single time on the situation?

I think it will change as cultural ideas evolve.

But I think the first thing is to just start lots of organizations, two or three people

in a group deciding on possible courses of action and creating networks of just little

personal interaction groups, but linking them up and being aware that the organizations

have to stay flexible in terms of basically about a million little groups with openness

to interact with other groups on different levels.

So basically create a large number of smaller organizations that will be much harder to

subvert just because the FBI doesn't have that manpower, that much manpower.

Yeah.

They've had, I don't know, maybe a million people attending to breaking up organizations.

But if you have 2 million little groups developing, it will overwhelm their manpower advantage.

Like the communists used to say that for every actual communist party member, there were

two or three FBI agents.

Yeah, I think that's what it sounds about, right?

Well, it seems like the FBI's ability and the CIA's ability to infiltrate movements

is like co-Intel Pro and I don't know, Ruby Ridge and like promoting domestic terror and

stuff or getting people to do things they otherwise wouldn't do.

Like what was that famous quote that like the FBI is behind most terrorist attacks in

the US or something like that?

Yeah, that has been documented over and over.

The people throwing rocks in demonstrations are usually local police or FBI.

What was it?

The Ferguson rap?

I'm not quite thinking of the right place, but there were provocateurs like breaking

windows and they were flown in on planes to go like cause havoc during peaceful protests

and stuff.

So yeah.

Yeah.

And like in the Ukraine, there were snipers shooting both sides.

And then people are so politically charged that they can't kind of see the forest for

the trees.

And then it's like this bad ideology on top of the corruption and the infiltration of

both sides.

I want to talk a little bit about consciousness.

Let's finish politics.

Let's talk about consciousness.

So we're up to about two hours.

And so Ray, I don't want to keep you all day.

Let's kind of end on consciousness.

And we have like 250 people listening right now.

So Ray, Georgie, thank you so much for making this possible.

Obviously a special live stream.

So yeah, go for it, Georgie.

Yeah.

In one of your books, actually, I think it was the Mind and Tissue where you said that

consciousness at its very basis is the orienting reflex, right?

So my question relates to physiologically, what does that look like?

Because there have been a number of studies coming out recently that are saying that medicine

and neurology have been looking at consciousness the wrong way.

They're calling it the heart problem of consciousness because by analyzing the brain and all of

the interactions of the neurons, they can't possibly explain the richness of personal

experience and they call this thing qualia.

And now they're proposing that maybe it's consciousness that's fundamental and it's

a property of matter.

It just varies in terms of its complexity depending on the object or the piece of matter

that we're actually observing.

So there's an ancient Hindu proverb which says that the spirit of God sleeps in stone,

dreams in animals, and awakens in man.

So my question is, how do you see that statement that consciousness is potentially a very basic

property of matter and it's the complexity of the structure of this matter that determines

how high level of this consciousness would be?

Does that sound about right?

Yeah, exactly.

I formulated it that way in 1957, I think was the first time I said consciousness is

the organized flow of energy through matter, but I have revised it to think of consciousness

as a substance in itself.

Since substances are defined empirically, matter is defined empirically as we experience

it.

So I think it's proper to think of consciousness as a substance.

For example, the donor-acceptor molecules contributing an electron flowing through muscle

causes it to contract.

I think that same donor-acceptor relationship activates a constant oscillation of excited

electrons through the neurons and between the neurons even, that it's a substance analogous

to the conductive electron bands in metal, but the electrons are existing on the soft

cytoplasmic material.

When the energy is properly activated by the oxidative acceptor function, raising electrons,

creating holes basically for electrons to flow through the properly oxidized substance,

it's like having a fire get wet when you have too many electrons.

It fills the holes and prevents the luminous function.

The perfume guy, I can't think of his name right now.

Tonini?

Was it Tonini or no?

No, a contemporary guy who was given...

Yeah, anyway, he sees odors as being resonant of the molecule, not the shape of the molecule,

but the electronic ability to resonate.

And that is going back to P.K.

Anokin, for example.

I think he saw his acceptor of action consciousness model as existing as an excited electron substance

which follows the rules of Gestalt psychology, actually space-filling material of electron

plasma, actually being what we experience, the light that we experience as red, white,

blue, green, and so on.

I think there is actually that frequency resonating in our brain tissue.

An odor, I believe the actual chemical pattern of that odor is what we experience.

The consciousness of smelling a chemical, that structure exists in space.

Each of the senses, I think, involves a certain frequency or energy level of the electrons

so that touch has a limited spatial ability.

The vision is the one that tends to be coherent at forming complexly coherent structures of

meaning.

So if I understand it correctly, as a result of metabolism, there is a directed electron

flow from food to oxygen, right?

And that donor-acceptor relationship causes the molecules in the cells to vibrate.

And if they vibrate at the same frequency, I'm guessing a certain amount of, like a minimum,

I guess a base number of neurons, if they vibrate at the same frequency, that creates

a resonance field, which is, I guess, the basis of consciousness.

And the qualia...

In one of his books, P.K.

Anokin goes through a series of articles showing that the mechanical behavior of the auditory

nerve, for example, can't carry the information that we actually experience flowing in on

the auditory nerve.

He has various arguments showing that much more information is carried per second than

nerve firing could possibly account for.

So it isn't information, it's actually the substance that we are experiencing.

So given the infinite richness of experience and the infinite richness of qualia, wouldn't

that imply that the brain cells would be capable of resonating in almost any frequency in order

to reproduce that infinite richness of reality?

I know that the frequencies have to be tuned very exactly.

And something like the psychedelics can, in effect, create new, more extensive pathways.

But I think the frequencies are all the same.

It's just lubricating new connections that become richer.

So you're saying potentially the same frequency could create the experience of the color green,

and then a different type of resonance, but with the same frequency, could create the

experience of listening to Mozart or something like that?

Yeah, the green comes in all degrees of saturation, mere green or psychedelic, full spectrum green

with meaning.

It resonates over into the feeling of religious meaning or the intensity of the meaning.

It isn't just one frequency, one meaning.

It's the intensity and saturation of that particular frequency.

And then the architectural structures built on those, so you could perceive Mozart or

Beethoven almost at the level of descriptive, rational listening, or you could have a full

energy flow, like a hi-fi consciousness where everything, all of the senses are resonating

full intensity.

So basically the range of frequencies that the brain is capable of producing is limited,

but their combination is infinite.

So that's what...

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

According to En-Okon, the auditory frequencies are...

We're actually transmitting the full range of frequencies and a young person can actually

experience all the way up to 35 or 40,000 cycles per second, like a porpoise.

And those are actually tuned processes of the electrons resonating at those actual frequencies

and the frequencies of nerve firing are nothing really related to consciousness.

They are like the infrastructure of maintaining energy production and substance distribution,

but the experience is floating over the infrastructure.

So speaking of resonance, and I'm sure you're familiar with the publications of Rupert Sheldrake,

I think is his name, about the morphogenetic fields and how we are essentially tapping

into the same pool of knowledge and any single person learning enriches that pool of knowledge

and then any other person could actually tap into that and sort of get access to that new

knowledge.

So...

He's in this morphogenic tradition going all the way to Goethe and earlier, but it's the

actual living side of science, not the abstract militarist, Platonist side of science.

So if two people are resonating, so to speak, if their consciousness are resonating and

almost merging in a sense, is there a limit to the distance that these people can be separated

with in order for this to occur?

Or is this like a global universal phenomenon, no matter where these consciousness capable

pieces of matter are?

Bucharach, did you ever read any of his books?

Adria Bucharach?

I haven't.

He, I think, makes a satisfactory case for the whole Earth resonance.

I think that the communication can probably be carried on like a carrier wave on the Earth's

resonance frequencies, modulating.

I think each brain can modulate that carrier wave of the Earth's electromagnetic field.

So the Schumann resonant frequencies could potentially be those carrier waves that allow

for the unification of consciousness of organisms on Earth?

Yeah.

The Canadian psychologist who invented the God helmet, an electronic helmet that stimulated

the brain so that people had religious experiences.

He suggests that we're tapping into the planetary carrier wave.

Okay.

So since we're on the sort of like resonance of consciousness and distance, as you've written

many times about David Bohm, and I'm a great fan of his work and writings, he was writing

that it's actually a universal consciousness that we're all part of, and that there is

a guiding pilot wave/carrier wave of which all of us are minor offshoots.

I didn't hear who you said.

David Bohm, the quantum physicist.

And he was basically saying that there's two kinds of order, the implicate order and the

explicate order, and then the explicate order arises out of the infinite implicate order

in a creative manner.

And we've talked about this process of constant creation of both matter and meaning and knowledge.

How do we participate in this creative process?

Because do we also create matter ourselves?

I mean, I know the Earth does, the stars do, right?

And probably the ethereal medium of the universe itself does, but how do we participate in

that creative process?

I don't know.

David Bohm was of the opinion that we are integral to the creative process of the universe,

but unfortunately he didn't elaborate how.

Yeah, I intuit that that's true, but I don't know how either.

I think it is most closely connected to this electronic jelly substance of consciousness

or whatever is flowing through any substance according to its structure.

But N. A. Kozirev noticed that entities in the universe, stars, planets, moons, and so

on, were emitting energy in proportion to their mass, and he believed that the passage

of time was a source of energy.

That simply says that energy comes out of the system, whatever matter is.

But he didn't have all of the planets' mass accurately connected to what was known about

their emission of heat.

But just in recent years, that was about 60 years ago he wrote that, but just in recent

years the satellites have measured the emission of the outer big planets and found that there

is an anomalous energy that corresponds to the mass rather than their position from the

sun.

So it's a big confirmation of Kozirev's idea that the mere passage of time and any

mass is going to be emitting energy.

So it's like we're all a fountain of energy of some sort.

So a question on Kozirev and stars, because actually that was one of my, that was the

top question I was going to ask you tonight and you brought it up yourself.

As you know, he did a lot of experiments on measuring and creating time based on different

processes.

So dissipating process that basically emit heat, he said that they produce time and that

other processes that are sort of, you know, dropping in temperature, they can actually

accept time, they can absorb time.

So what do you think time is in terms of a physical entity?

My best guess is that Forrest Dudley was right and he described it as the neutrino sea.

At that time neutrinos were thought to have no energy, but he proposed that they do have

energy and that they associate with matter according to its mass and that nuclear, so-called

nuclear energy is converting in conventional thinking, converting mass to energy or in

this view, it's simply being through time, passing through time as a mass that allows

these neutrinos to interact.

And crystals, Forrest Dudley suggested that the crystalline structure of matter was in

some way in charge of how the neutrinos resonate, that there's a space-filling resonance of

neutrinos corresponding to the orderly arrangement of crystals that he suggested could cause

nuclear reactions to occur unpredicted.

And simultaneously with his proposing that theory, an experimental physicist named Anderson

observed that a monolayer of carbon isotopes on aluminum foil had a non-random nuclear

decay.

Dudley had predicted that sort of thing, that an orderly arrangement of matter such as a

surface would interact with the neutrino sea in a way that would draw on the energy of

the nucleus.

But anyway, my inference from those two bits of data is that the brain, this structure

of donor-acceptor activated gel of electrons.

My idea is that this structure of the brain is like the surface of the aluminum foil,

able to tap into the energy of the neutrino sea, and this is where the introduction of

novelty as well as energy comes from.

Understood.

I read an interpretation of Aristotle recently that said that, it was by a quantum physicist,

and he said that everybody has struggled with the definition of time, of what time is and

how it relates to us.

And apparently Aristotle got pretty close.

He said in one of his writings, apparently, I haven't seen the actual one, but he said

that time is simply the amount of potentiality that has converted to actuality for any given

system.

Does that sound about right?

Sounds right.

Okay, and last question related to consciousness.

If the stars are perhaps the most intense entities with the most intense metabolism,

for lack of a better word, would you say that they possess a type of consciousness, perhaps

even higher than ours?

I would think a galaxy, the streaming shape-creating forces of galaxies are probably conscious.

There's no more streaming energy through matter than a galaxy in action.

But I think our brains are rivaling the galaxies for the complexity of activated substance

that we're trying to imitate the galaxy energy with actual physical creation of substance

at the edge of the process.

That's remarkable.

I don't know if you know, but Aristotle said that in his classification, there were very

few pure actualities.

And he said that humans, galaxies, stars, and I think he mentioned one other thing,

cosmological, I'm forgetting what it is, but in his view, those were the only actualities.

So he was placing them at the same level, I'm guessing, in terms of development as you

are.

Yeah, that sounds right.

Okay.

I don't have any other questions.

Speaking of, this is neither here nor there, but have you guys, there's like a special

type of camera that's fairly new that can accurately zoom in on stars and planets.

And the footage these people are taking of the stars and planets looks literally like

nothing I've ever seen before, but they look like big balls of kind of multicolored energy.

Like that's how I would describe it.

Ray, are you familiar with that at all?

No.

I'll forward you with them.

But it's like, it's a lot of the flat earth people use it to say that NASA is lying about

everything.

But I think it's just interesting that we're actually like, just random people are able

to take a really interesting video of stars.

Okay.

So I guess we'll end it there.

Let me just read.

So Ray, I don't know if you know how it works, but people do super chats and a big group

of people have accumulated $794.

So whatever YouTube takes of that, I will forward to you, Ray.

And I appreciate you being on here and let me just read.

We won't be able to get to people's questions because that would, we would be on here for

hours.

Turkish Postman, I think we just got one more, DBO514.

Thank you guys so much.

I apologize for not being able to read your questions.

Georgie and I can like devote an entire episode to trying to answer these questions.

Any parting words, Ray?

Can you tell people how to obtain your newsletter?

You can email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com and see if you can have people come up with

ideas and create new organizations.

I love it.

I love it.

So, and then Georgie, any parting words?

A question for Dr. Peat in terms of ideas for scientific studies that he thinks are

worth replicating.

I mean, I haven't mentioned it.

I mentioned in previous podcasts with Danny, but I'm privileged enough to start being able

to make my own studies and I was thinking of doing one on essential fatty acid depletion

and trying to prove that all of the, because there's only one by the Burrs in the 1930s.

So, I'm trying to prove that really all of these symptoms of fatty acid, essential fatty

acid deficiencies that they were seeing were just deficiencies of specific nutrients and

maybe insufficient amount of calories and things like that.

Anything else, any other seminal idea that you think is really currently being twisted

and poisoning the scientific and the medical world that we can try and test and sort of

show the exact opposite?

If I think of something, I'll contact you.

Okay.

Understood.

Thank you.

Awesome.

Ray, stay on the line.

I'm going to kind of wrap things up.

Guys, thank you so much.

Like 250 people in the chat right now.

Guys, sincerely appreciate it.

Thank you so much to Ray for making this possible and just being an endless inspiration and

such a humble guy.

And I'm sure I don't, I can't speak for only for myself, but changing so many people's

lives.

Thank you so much to Gorgie for doing the show with me so often.

And this was just a special live stream.

So thank you guys so much for making this possible.

Ray, stay on the line.

We'll talk to you after.

And I'm going to wrap things up here.

Everybody, thank you so much.

We'll see you guys.

I'll see you next week, I think with Tim.

Okay, guys, take care.So Dr. Peat, what do you think made cultures...

Okay, and we're live.

Hello, everybody.

Welcome.

We have Georgie and Mr. Raymond Peat on the line, and we are talking about Aristotle.

We were talking about forms matter, deep politics.

And so I'm not going to interrupt what we were talking about, but Georgie, go ahead.

Yeah, I was curious what Dr. Peat thinks made that specific parts of the world amenable

to such contradictory ideas, basically.

I mean, is it something in the way people saw the world in those different parts?

I mean, the way people saw reality in those different parts of the world?

Why would the Eastern Europe or like Eastern world be so amenable to change and so accepting

of change, while the Western world would be like, "Nope, we're firmly controlled.

That's the only theory that we accept is true."

Change must be happening everywhere.

Why would it take root in certain parts of the world and not others?

In the '50s, I was considering the Whorfian hypothesis that language, the structure of

language has evolved in remote history, that the structure of language contributes to that.

But I fairly quickly realized that cultural things such as the difference between Aristotle

and Plato in the available literature, when people were just barely starting to get literate.

The church was a force for literacy, and it happened that the Eastern Christian church

got the good Aristotle literature, and the West was influenced by Platonism.

So I still tend to think that there are slight differences from the structure of language.

There's a linguist at Stanford who is the contemporary Whorfian apologist.

I think that can be seen in the difference between English and German, for example, and

between, say, Chinese and Hindi.

Chinese has, through use, reduced the superstructure of grammatical form and depends greatly on

context.

I think that there's a noticeable difference between English and the older European languages

with more context dependence in English grammar.

Are you familiar with the ideas of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein?

Oh yeah.

The thing I liked about him was that he numbered his paragraphs instead of trying to make a

grand argument that progressed logically.

He simply made statements and numbered them because he believed that every statement implies

a metaphysical surrounding.

I had been studying Bertrand Russell and the linguistic philosophers who I saw as being

a way—not Russell, but the people who followed him and called themselves the language philosophers,

like John Wisdom.

I saw them as trying to sneak in the old Platonism entities, logical atomism, for example, which

was Russell's word for it.

Wittgenstein blew that up and showed somewhat a resonance with the old Leibniz, a universe

being implied in every statement or every event implying the surrounding context.

The thing that made the most impression on me is that he said there's no such thing

as private language.

There are no private thoughts that can all be expressed and there are no private fields,

as you said in many of your interviews.

Yeah, but when you try to work out the implications of "there is no private language," you're

always guessing statistically that you're understanding the other person.

If you can't remember for sure, your own language is consistent and testable.

When you look at the other person, you're just making a statistically sounder guess,

but there's no essential difference between shared language and the private language once

you realize that they all depend on memory and interpretation.

Okay.

Wow, that's pretty interesting.

That leads me to the next question.

You had a discussion with Daniel about Lenin, memory, and matter.

You said, "Well, Lenin said that knowledge is memory and it's coming from matter, but

it's not matter, right?

Matter is everything we don't know.

So what is knowledge then?

I mean, if it's not matter, what is knowledge?"

It's the physiological presence of matter and the info is the matter itself that hasn't

been incorporated into our perspective.

Okay.

So would you say that knowledge is simply the structure of matter that we incorporate

into ourselves?

Yeah.

It's living matter and it's always open to living a new phase and that openness to new

life is matter.

Okay.

Info is all we can say about matter.

Understood.

It's not denying the materiality.

It's saying that this is the living matter that is our consciousness and that's like

an internal fountain in effect.

It's always going on, going ahead, becoming something else.

And that's the nature of matter, that it's creating this constant flow of knowledge.

Okay.

So in another interview, I think again with Danny, you basically said that nothing is

stored, right?

Basically how we feel about our memories and knowledge in general depends largely on thyroid

function and metabolism in general.

So if knowledge isn't stored, I mean, where is it?

Like when we access a memory, so to speak, what does that process physiologically look

like?

It's some trace in our facial muscles, viscera, posture.

We work through a series of reinventions, finding these pictures, which are arrangements

of excitations.

We don't go straight to a picture, we work by inference and traces to reconstruct it.

And so every time we bring up the past, we're creating a new past.

Okay.

So basically, so when we're remembering, we're partially recreating the memory.

Yeah.

It's always newly experienced.

The idea that something is stored becomes part of that Platonist idea that it ends up

saying that atoms are timeless entities and can be accurately described only by changeless

units of logic.

You can't let change into the system if you're in that logical atomism range all the way

to Platonism.

Platonism is denying that an individual atom has a history, for example.

The memory as reconstruction is that we're like a whirlwind of consciousness, but the

shape of our individual whirlwind is always ongoing, but is moving ahead with some degree

of deduction from our previous states.

And looking back, it's like a reverse deduction to reconstruct that we must have experienced

that being where we are.

And probably one of those same conversations we were talking about, I was asking you some

philosophical questions and you said something like you have to start and end with being

an animal.

And I think you said something like an animal reality.

Can you talk about that a little bit, because I found that to be pretty interesting.

Yeah, where an animal experiencing nature around it or people is aware of its needs

and hopes and also any fears that it has.

It interprets particular objects or processes as either hopeful or fearsome, and otherwise

it's in the process of going through the present situation with the intention of finding

the realization of what it wants.

And people have, the culture has piled up belief and stories that complicate that so

that we don't see ourselves as surrounded by future and dangers, future possibilities

and threats.

And I think anytime you're going to get back on the track of realizing yourself, the larger

intention, the thing that religious people feel as some kind of overarching meaning for

the animal, the human, hopefully biologically amplified animal doing things that some animals

can't do.

By our energy amplification, we can have the animal intentionality encompassing future

possibilities on a transpersonal scale, seeing the need for the ecosystem and for the society,

for other individuals, even for different kinds of organisms, taking responsibility

in a straight line with yourself, feeling that you're responsible for all of the stuff

around you, that you see it all as hopeful moving towards the future and don't have

any of these cultural kinks that say, "I own this," or "I have to destroy this

to do this," and so on.

You try to picture overarching series of meanings so that everything can get into a better future.

Are you saying, sorry, are you saying that amplified rate of metabolism coexists with

a sense of solidarity with other humans or the Kropotkin mutual aid, assuming your basic

needs are met?

Yeah.

I see Kropotkin blending in with Vernadsky, Vernadsky saying that the flow of energy from

the sun into the earth is trying, the substance responding to that flow of energy is creating

a living structural system that is assimilating and accumulating the interactions of the different

levels of the ecosystem, permitting the optimizing the metabolism of the big animal developing

a big brain and doing the things that are appropriate, like animals tearing through

the jungle are improving the fertility of the system, not damaging it.

Like Alan Savory, his rough idea is compatible with Vernadsky, that the big animals are a

big part of the ecosystems that they develop in and they are pulling, helping to pull the

whole ecosystem forward.

Because there's such massive energy dissipating structures?

Yeah.

Okay.

So, on the being an animal in this world, are you referring to basically Pavlov's ideas

of the first and second signal system?

The first one being, first signal system being basically the animal raw perception of reality?

Yeah, I don't see it as being strictly second.

The first signal system, P.K.

Anokhin, who was a colleague younger than Pavlov, developed the picture of the consciousness

in this unified sense.

He called it the acceptor of action, which you can't really separate the orienting reflex

or the dominant concept from the acceptor of action.

It's the present state of the organism in pictorial space-filling model of the world.

The second signal system, in Pavlov's term, gets its structure by acting as names for

structures in this acceptor of action, like you have a little three-dimensional holographic

movie going on with your intentions cycling through this movie model of the world.

The words, the second signal system, attaches to each part of the model of the world, has

a naming relationship.

Marx or Engels referred to it as a name of a ghost.

The second signal system gets its structure exclusively from this pictorial model of the

world, the acceptor of action.

To me, the way I understood your book, at least, was that intuition was part of the

first signal system, and then this capacity for rigid, analytical, abstract thought felt

like it didn't even need images.

That was part of the second signal system.

And then the authoritarian mind and people with authoritarian tendencies tend to really

emphasize the second signal system, in other words, purely abstract thought without any

connection to reality, to the first signal system.

Yeah, I did.

When I was studying psychology at the university, I did a survey asking people how they dreamed,

as well as their waking thought processes.

And I found that there were people who didn't know what it was to dream in pictures.

They said a dream was like listening to someone tell a story.

And those people were on a scale of creativity.

They would be absolute zero.

They followed verbal rules.

Somehow they could talk to people and seem to communicate in English.

They had no ability to think with any innovation.

It was only what could be said in a familiar way.

And when your acceptor of action is de-energized, it tends to disappear, leaving just these

solidified units of language.

You can't learn a language without having some fluidity in this model of the world.

But by the age of six or seven, people are often losing enough biological energy that

they start seeing reality in terms of only the cliches that they can say.

This might be semi off the topic, but where does personal responsibility, but also the

destruction of the individual from the culture, where does personal responsibility begin where

a person is born into a culture that basically sets them up for total failure?

We're going to talk about vaccines, but when I went home to Southern California, probably

a few years ago, my mom gave me a sheet of all the vaccines I got when I was a little

kid and it was like a ridiculous, I don't remember, it was like 20.

I know that's even worse now.

It just seems like, and I know you talked about with, what was his name, Guillermo,

but how the universe is expanding and growing, but our society is kind of declining at the

same time.

Yeah, you can see biological decline.

I looked at the birth weight of different nations and the head size, and for much of

the 19th and 20th century, birth weights and brain sizes were increasing steadily.

In 1980, several countries had an actual shrinkage of brain size or a growth in height with no

growth in brain from decade to decade.

So the cultural imposition really is literally shrinking people's brains now.

I just read a few days ago, like Generation Z has a pretty high suicide rate and doesn't

look good.

75% of them are actually, apparently have mental illness.

They meet the diagnostic criteria, as fake as it is, for at least one mental illness,

according to the American Psychiatric Association.

This is like the youngest generation that's just entering, not the workforce, but they're

in high school now.

I think that kind of information has to get through to the people who own and run the

world that their machine is breaking down.

If they really take their ownership seriously, that they want to keep their wealth, they'd

better start repairing the mechanism because the components are deteriorating too fast.

Are there any grassroots kind of movements that you think have potential for really changing

things?

Like how likely is it that something from the top is going to change everything, like

kind of the elite psychopath type of people?

I think it is most likely that it will be some disaster that forces it.

What was the Diane Fossier, the degrowth thing?

She thought like we would have to go through a primitive state or go back to a primitive

state?

I don't think it's possible to get back to any kind of a good primitive state, but I

think some kind of a big shock is going to have to happen before people, like people

fearing Elizabeth Warren's policy suggestions and simply ruling out people like that.

Both parties are committed to destroying the world.

So unless people start dismantling, preferably the Democratic Party, since there are still

people who remember that there used to be policies connected with the party, dismantling

that seems like a possible route to the future.

I wanted to backtrack a little bit on the verbal system.

I don't know, Dr. Peter, are you familiar with this sign/symptom/pathology in psychiatry?

They call it Logorare.

Basically, it's almost like it literally means verbal diarrhea.

And I stumbled upon it a few weeks ago, and when I looked into it, older studies show

that it's basically overwhelmingly connected to a number of psychiatric conditions that

are known to be driven by excess estrogen and serotonin.

And so my question is, do you think that this excessive verbalism, that essentially estrogen

and serotonin are partly mediating that?

And also, do you think that if somebody is in a culture that's excessively over-verbalized,

eventually it can lead to such pathologies itself?

Women in general produce many more words per minute than men on average.

Starting at the menstrual phase, when estrogen is highest, they can't stop talking.

And I think that involves a short circuit of the pictorial, space-filling thought and

directing the energy through these repetitive verbal patterns.

Very easy to make, not conforming to any practical use.

The thing about the acceptor of action, the pictorial model of the world, is that it's

always changing.

There's nothing repeated.

Anything you try to do twice, it's always different the second time.

The word consciousness, the estrogen-driven, lubricated word machine doesn't get any newness

admitted.

It's always repeating, tending to be cliched, and rehashing things that have already been

built into the system.

In one of your older interviews, you mentioned that you try to spend at least one day a week

not really uttering any words, or reading, and just painting and doing non-verbal activities.

You must be thinking that it's beneficial to do it if you're doing it on purpose.

I'm guessing my question is, do you think that excessive verbalization, when it's voluntary,

it can basically be detrimental?

Not if you keep your energy up.

When I had to teach 12 hours a week, different classes, after just two or three weeks, my

verbal fluency went up tremendously just because I was exercising that.

But I never repeated any idea twice through the whole series of lectures.

If you keep your energy up, you can verbalize fairly fluently, but always bending the message

a little so there's nothing repeated.

People always remark how, on KMUD, when Andrew asks you to introduce yourself, you'll change

it basically every single time.

Are you saying that's the result of keeping the energy up, or are you consciously trying

to recreate your history in all the things you've done?

I never have the same history twice.

A friend had a TV program, and she wanted to do some hour interviews.

She was an experienced TV person, so she would run through a trial program and then say she

wanted to do it again, but I would give different answers every time.

She finally gave up and realized that it was always going to be different answers.

But that's just the way I see the question.

The question never looks the same the second time.

Well, Karen told me probably five or more years ago, she's like, "Danny, something you

have to understand about Ray is when you try to put him in a box, he's going to immediately

want to get out."

So, that made a big...

Or won't even get out.

Yeah, exactly.

But I'm saying, is that a unique aspect of your personality, or do you think that's a

metabolic thing of trying to always stay in a creative mindset or something about your

history?

I first noticed it when I was, I think, three years old and helping my father with a repetitive

task.

I realized that every time I repeated the task, I was a new person.

And ever since then, I've never been able to have the illusion of doing something twice.

And that's then...

If that's the case, then don't you think that schools are really harmful because they emphasize

this routine at every step of the educational process, both the elementary schools, the

high schools, and the universities.

They really don't like you being different every single time.

Yeah, if a person let them be tortured constantly, but you just have to be quiet and let them

do their thing.

I feel like one of the worst parts about school was sitting down.

And now learning about restraint stress and things like that, that seems part of the...

I remember just feeling like it was torture sitting down for so long all day.

It's awful.

Yeah.

My only concern is that you once said that faint stupidity becomes real stupidity.

So I guess a person just has to be sitting there and hoping that they're not going to

be stuck in the educational system long enough to become an idiot like all the other people

being turned into slaves, mental slaves.

Yeah, people who did IQ tests on New York City, every year they gave the same students

more IQ tests and found that every year their IQ went down.

Wow.

Have you also seen the studies showing that the earlier a child starts school, basically

the dumber they will exit the whole educational system?

I hadn't seen that, but that would be the same principle.

I have two sisters and I don't think either of them watch this, but the one that didn't

go to college I can talk normally with.

And then the one that did go to college, we don't have very much in common.

So I've definitely seen that played out.

Ray, do you think the vaccinations, besides the food and the polyunsaturated fats, you

see that as a major kind of problem for society?

Yeah.

I mean, until fairly recently, I hadn't realized that kids are now getting 50 shots by the

time they grow up.

Robert Kennedy Jr. mentioned that until 1980, only 2.5%, I think, of kids, he said, had

allergies.

Starting in the 1980s, I think he said it was over half of the kids now have serious

allergies.

And if you want to create an allergy in an animal, you give it an injection.

Intramuscular is ideal to include some little thing like an egg protein or milk protein

or any of the various proteins that are in the culture media that they make vaccines

in.

So they are replicating animal allergy creation every time they give a shot.

There's no way to deny it sensibly.

I think on one of our conversations, you said the background for vaccines was related to

what, like the Rockefeller Foundation and trying to keep workers active.

But now, do you think they take on a different meaning nowadays?

Yeah, I think the money, tremendous money, billions of dollars, 50 billion a year, I

think it is profits, mostly profits from the sale of just vaccines.

I don't know if Dr. Peat has seen the news, but I was shocked to see CNN last week, putting

a headline news that basically said, "CDC is warning.

It's not a question of if, but when coronavirus will create a massive epidemic in the United

States."

And I thought to myself, why would a health agency issue such a statement?

And then why would a major news media publish it?

Isn't that like the exact opposite what a government should be doing?

Like scaring all of its citizens and not really providing any answers.

They're just saying it will be bad and be very afraid.

Yeah, but the CDC, I don't know what the average is, but over the last, I think at least 15

years, they say that the annual deaths produced by influenza, and I think they're all coronavirus

influenza, that's just the standard category that produces influenza.

They have been saying, I think it ranges from 9 million deaths per year in the United States

to a high of 57 million deaths from influenza per year.

That's worldwide?

Now they expect us to get excited when a dozen people die.

I was trying to think of all the swine flu, SARS, bird flu, Zika virus, is the difference

between all these things.

It seems like, I was talking about it with Georgie before I got on the phone with you,

Ray.

I have a Twitter application on my phone.

So when I do turn on my phone, the application of Twitter, there is a new huge bar on the

screen just updating me on coronavirus.

But I've never, the application has changed to give me updates that I've never asked for

on coronavirus.

And it just seems like the marketing campaign is palpable, very, very strong.

Yeah, and the World Health Organization is sharing in the corruption, conflicts of interest.

So you can't trust any of the big organizations because they manage to profit in some way

from the huge amount of wealth that's being directed through the vaccines.

I have a question about viral resilience in general.

I was reading some older studies and they were all showing that basically the more hydrophilic

the cell is, the greater its susceptibility to a viral infection.

And then I thought, okay, so doesn't that suggest that the presence of polyunsaturated

fats in the blood would increase susceptibility to the virus?

And unsurprisingly or surprisingly, there are quite a few studies published before the

1950s that made that exact same claim, that if you have high levels of unsaturated fats

in the blood, they will increase the affinity of the cell for water and also for these viral

particles.

But if the level of free fatty acids in the blood are low, then cells were extremely resilient

to even lethal viruses like the rabies.

Yeah, that whole subject, polyunsaturated fats, it's worse than any organized crime

campaign.

Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats are gigantic criminal businesses and the omega-3 fats are

especially powerful in immune suppression, but they market that as being anti-inflammatory.

Right.

So my question was like basically, wouldn't something as simple as taking some aspirin

and niacinamide essentially greatly reduce the risk of catching any viral infection?

Yeah, I think so.

And aspirin happens to be an antiviral agent in itself, antibacterial and antiviral.

And there was a study, I think around Washington, DC, that tested it on AIDS patients, just

big doses of aspirin and it was working, but no one was interested.

I actually met, I live in DC and I met one of the people who were involved in the study

and he refuses to talk about it.

Basically the statement was, the question is too political.

And I said, "Well, I've seen the study.

You guys claim that it was terminated because there was a rise in the levels of the liver

enzymes in the aspirin group."

And he said, "Yeah, that was the official story, but that's not why it was stopped."

And when I asked why it was stopped, he said, "It's way above my pay grade."

I mean, meaning mine, not his.

Ray, one of the papers you had cited in one of your articles, the Persaud paper, and they

say, "It is perhaps surprising that essential lipids that are supposed to be so good for

health are so potent at killing cells."

So yeah, just supporting what you're talking about.

And then you on your HIV article were referencing papers that those people had high levels of

PUFA in their blood.

And it's something I had never even heard of anywhere else.

Yeah, immunodeficiency is a big thing apart from any virus.

Sepsis has been growing along with other degenerative diseases, but young people never used to get

sepsis practically.

But now sepsis is affecting younger and younger people in bigger numbers.

And I think it's largely the stress cumulative effects on PUFA.

Well, something that's popular among my group of friends is the idea of herd immunity.

Do you want to speak about that?

I think that's why people are scared.

And my freedom-loving friends, the best of them would still want other people to forcefully

get vaccinations because they fear for their own safety.

And so do you want to maybe speak if you know where that idea stemmed from and then how

it does not fit into your biological and physiological picture?

It sounds very much like a Nazi program.

It doesn't have any convincing weight for me.

It just makes me fear the people that say we're a herd that has to be treated one way

or another.

Have you seen any of that movie Vaxxed?

They talk about the military vaccinating people and creating Gulf War syndrome with the anthrax

vaccine.

Well, I hadn't read that specifically, but Diana Dutton wrote a book called Worse Than

Disease where she kind of details the swine flu.

And it was kind of similar to what you said earlier about coronavirus.

Like the problem didn't kill very many people, but the vaccine caused tons of problems.

Yeah, one guy was routed out of bed to go on a forced march and collapsed while marching

and died shortly after, and he was diagnosed as having swine flu.

He was the only death acknowledged by the head of the CDC from swine flu.

But I forget the exact number, but there were thousands of paralytic reactions, and I think

it was around 300 deaths from the vaccine.

So hundreds of times worse than the disease.

You say in your newsletter, if a vaccine hasn't produced swelling, fever, anaphylaxis, shock,

paralysis, or death, within two months, it is safe.

Or the public health view, it seems to be that if a vaccine hasn't produced swelling,

which is just crazy.

Yeah, I wanted to mention something about HIV.

Dr. Peat may have seen that study.

I think it came out around 2014.

Of course, it didn't hit mainstream media, but it showed that, at least the authors claimed

that you cannot develop AIDS if you're HIV positive.

So you cannot develop AIDS unless there's high levels of endotoxin in your blood.

And then there was a subsequent study, I think in 2018, which showed that the single most

reliable predictor of death of all-cause mortality in HIV positive people was this level of this

protein called soluble CD14.

It's abbreviated SCD14, and that is the most reliable biomarker of endotoxin levels in

the blood.

And for some reason, I never see virologists talk about the role of endotoxin in viral

disease and multi-organ failure and in septic shock.

Well, in reality, it seems like all of these things are directly caused by endotoxin.

Yeah, I'm inclined to think that even cancer is largely an endotoxin problem.

Chronic year after year of bad food irritating the intestine, causing increased histamine

and serotonin and estrogen, but a constant stream of endotoxin flowing through the system,

shaking up chromosomes, creating inflammation, fatiguing the repair systems.

Finally, when the repair systems are down to a certain extent, the cancers that are

constantly popping up stop being removed.

And so if you don't die of acute sepsis, then heart disease and cancer, I think, are the

result of chronic exposure to the endotoxin.

So would you say the specific organ or tissue where the cancer appears, the apparently localized

nature, even though we know it's a systemic problem, the apparently localized nature is

simply because that particular organ or tissue was the most energetically compromised.

That's why it took a hold there.

Yeah.

When I've mentioned the idea of systemic disease to cancer doctors or patients, they really

have a hard time, just can't grasp.

They've been so indoctrinated with the idea that it's a clone that develops one single

mutant cell develops into the clone.

And so it's by definition the most localized thing conceivable.

It's platonically localized.

But way back 80 or 90 years, people have been seeing precancerous gradations surrounding

any tumor.

If you look at all of the signs of stem cell signals, all of the inflammatory cytokines,

disturbed chromosome balance, all of those things are increased in a gradient.

The field concept of cancer goes way back 200 years almost, but it just hasn't been

acceptable because of this platonistic genetic determinism, clonal descent of each tumor.

Have you seen the study that came out in 2015?

Basically made huge waves across the oncology community, if there is such a thing.

And it basically said for over a hundred years, we've been wrong.

We've been calling it the Warburg effect, but now it seems that the effect is the cause

as well.

In other words, metabolic disturbances and specifically lactic acid precede the genomic

abnormalities that are seen in cancer cells and actually the cause of them, not the other

way around.

Yeah.

Lactic acid creates a reduced state, shift the balance towards increased sulfhydryl,

NADH ratio to NAD, and all of the electronic and energetic properties of cancer are initiated

just by putting a lot of lactic acid into the system.

Yeah.

I was just, I saw, I mean, it was posted on one of the biggest social media sites and

you could see doctors chiming in and some of them being panicky and saying, "Oh my

God, if this is true, it means in my practice as an oncologist, I've been killing people."

And others are saying, "Well, it's too early.

Let's see genetics.

We haven't heard the last of genetics yet.

Let's give genetics a chance.

Maybe we'll find a way to treat it genetically."

But overall the mood was, well, it was pessimistic for the oncologist, but the general public

that was reading this thread and responding seemed to be pretty ecstatic because people

immediately caught on the fact that if cancer is metabolic and it's this continuous field,

then it can probably be reversed.

You don't need to subject yourself to this torture that your oncologist is giving you

and likely killing you.

There are other ways.

And the doctors were heavily arguing against it in that same thread saying, "No, people,

if you choose the metabolic route, you'll be killing yourselves.

You're signing your death warrants.

You should stay with a traditional therapist because until we know more."

Did you ever read Max Gerson's book?

I think it's called 59 Cases.

He, coffee enemas were one of his staples.

He generally gave people thyroid and tried to get their metabolism towards oxidative

energy production.

But cleaning the intestine was probably his single most effective thing.

Even if he sometimes had an old person who was very debilitated, he would sometimes give

them a coffee enema every hour around the clock.

Get them out of bed to wash their intestine again.

He actually cured numerous advanced cases of cancer documented with photographs.

I think chronically keeping the endotoxin down gives the recuperative system a great

chance.

So that would explain largely why recent studies with the tetracycline and the biotics, especially

doxycycline, are reporting such remarkable effects.

Yeah.

In 1965, which was the first time, some doctor sent me an argument that he was curing cancer

with antibiotics.

I didn't at that time think of it in terms of cutting out the endotoxin, but people have

been doing it repeatedly over several decades.

I have to send you a press release from Harvard University, I think it's from early '90s.

It's about a lady that ran a cancer lab there.

The news article was a popular press article.

It said, "Doctor Johnson is capable of curing mice of lethal leukemia every time she wants

to."

How does she do that?

By giving them tetracycline.

Then immediately the question is, "Why can't this be done in people?"

She said, "Because it's not FDA approved."

I thought to myself, "What a stupid excuse.

What is the antibiotic going to do to these terminally ill people?

What, kill them?"

I mean, they're dying anyways.

Why not try something that's already approved for usage in people and it's known to be relatively

safe?

Why do we have to wait on the bureaucracy to give us approval to live?

Why can't this be tried by good natured doctors?

I've known doctors who were declared imminently dying in hospital and they wanted to try something

on their own.

The supervising doctors took their stuff away from them, wouldn't let experiment, even though

they were said to have only 48 hours left to live, they couldn't experiment on themselves.

Yeah, I remember there was a neurologist who got a neuroglial dystoma and he started injecting

himself with some kind of a virus or bacteria to give himself fever because he read that

fever sometimes cured cancer.

He was immediately declared mentally unfit.

They basically committed this doctor who used to work in this hospital, they locked him

up in his own hospital and let him, he died like a few weeks later.

There have been a couple of studies in which people, they accidentally noticed that women

who were given an antibiotic course, among other things, they recovered from their headaches,

but they did blood tests and found that before the antibiotic, they had high estrogen and

cortisol and low progesterone and after the course of antibiotics, their progesterone

went up and both cortisol and the estrogen went down, both of which would favor recovery

from cancer.

The cortisol is weakening your immune processes, for example, and estrogen is stimulating the

cell growth.

In rats, same thing was observed.

A course of antibiotics lowers cortisol and estrogen and increases progesterone and so

the coffee enema or the antibiotic or a high fiber diet, all of those things are actually

remedying your hormone situation.

Did you know that cortisol is given to pretty much any cancer patients as kind of like a

standard treatment?

Along with morphine.

And morphine, yes.

And morphine increases histamine release.

Histamine is a powerful tumor promoter, so they usually adjust the dose so that they're

dead before they notice that the tumor has grown faster.

I just never cease to amaze me.

The explanation of the doctors, because I used to work in a medical field, was that

well, the patient has inflammation in edema and we need to reduce it with a cortisol and

I thought, "Aren't there other safer anti-inflammatory methods?"

Because even as ignorant as some doctors are, some of them do know that cortisol does not

seem to be helping the tumor patients.

They're almost using it because by definition, that's the powerful anti-inflammatory they

have on file and they have to use it.

Ray, would you put Paul Ehrlich in the pantheon of people that have ruined science?

So Weissman, Paul Ehrlich.

And Ehrlich was the same guy that did the estrogen receptor stuff, is that right?

He popularized the whole idea of lock and key receptor specificity.

That whole receptor idea is perfect for selling chemicals.

Every chemical can have a receptor and so it's perfect for the chemical industry.

And the holistic, ongoing whirlwind picture of the organism where, for example, a large

dose of a chemical can have an opposite effect of a small dose.

Those contradictory anti-receptor pictures are no good for the chemical industry.

I have a question about the whole receptor thing.

I'm sure you've probably noticed this yourself, but I looked at all of the hormones that are

currently known and then I also looked at the receptor and the receptor structure.

There is a significant overlap in terms of the amino acid sequence and the structure

of the various receptors.

So even though, let's say, a pharmaceutical company may claim that they've developed this

extremely selective, say, estrogen agonist, if you go back and look at the other studies

done by other groups, you'll see invariably that the substance that they claim is extremely

selective is invariably acting on other receptors as well.

So my question is, is it even possible to develop a truly selective receptor compound

given that the various receptors have so much overlap?

No, I don't think so.

The whole idea of receptors derives from Ehrlich and I think it's right down to its foundation,

Karep.

Szent-Györgyi reviewed in one of his books ideas that Pavlov was familiar with around the turn

of the century.

The idea that the dose determines the effect, like a small amount of caffeine is sedative,

a large amount is stimulating, and even larger amount is narcotic.

And the dose of a sedative, a small dose will be a stimulant, a larger dose a sedative.

And the typical curve has been tested on hundreds of different substances and it consistently

contradicts the idea of a specific receptor doing a specific thing.

The only way you can imagine that three-phase curve working is if you think of the cell

as substance or characteristic qualities and substance.

You have to think as something which can move from one phase to another, potentially a series

of phase, each phase having a characteristic behavior.

So the differentiation occurs in the cytoplasm as a whole and that state of the cytoplasm

evokes the expression or stabilizes the expression of the genes that are appropriate for that

state.

And by thinking in terms of physical states, you can visualize the quantity as reaching

a threshold of cooperative phase transition happens when many things work in the same

direction.

So basically the whole idea of using one substance that will work in only one particular way,

it's hopeless.

I mean, basically the organism doesn't work like that.

You can create the illusion that it does by setting conditions just exactly right and

then you can get the apparent specific interaction and reaction, but it's a purely artificial

setup.

Have you seen the recent news about the resurgence of estrogen, of hormone replacement therapy

with estrogen in menopausal women?

They're trying to kind of put down all the findings of the Women's Health Initiative

study and try to reintroduce estrogen as therapy.

Yeah, in 1973 or '74, I saw a resurgence and about every five or ten years, the actual

science makes a little headway.

The big headway was the Women's Health Initiative and within five years, the people at Stanford

were instrumental in explaining why estrogen didn't really cause cancer, strokes, heart

attacks and so on and their favorite explanation is it's really progesterone.

And originally, estrogen was recognized as doing certain things to the organism and they

identified the estrogen receptor as a major way that it does that even though hypoxia

in the absence of estrogen will cause the receptor to behave the same.

Estrogen creates hypoxia and activates the estrogen.

Hypoxia alone will do it if something else creates it.

When they needed to explain away that estrogen does everything that it does, they discovered

the estrogen receptor beta and it turns out that almost everything that estrogen doesn't

do, the beta does, it stops growth, stops all of the characteristic estrogen behaviors

and pretty much parallels the actions of progesterone and progesterone now is divided into an A

and B receptor.

The A receptor is activated by estrogen and it activates the progesterone B but they're

just thinking wildly of ways that they can say that progesterone is responsible for all

of the bad stuff that has been blamed on estrogen.

I emailed one of the authors of one of the big papers that's now calling for reintroduction

of estrogen as therapy for women and I said, "How can we ignore all this science?

I mean that's pretty much indisputable that estrogen is carcinogenic."

There is actually a page posted on the website of the National Institutes of Health which

officially defines and declares estrogen as a carcinogen and a mutagen and I said, "Well,

your own organization," I think basically that person either used to work or works at

NIH, I said, "Your own organization says that estrogen is this dangerous chemical."

He said, "Well, estrogen has non-genomic effects that are actually beneficial and if

we give it at lower dosages, it acts as a powerful antioxidant that will remove the

need for people to take vitamin E and C and it will give them all the benefit for heart

protection without actually having the carcinogenic effects."

Are you still there, Georgie?

Oh no, did we lose Ray?

Maybe we did.

Okay.

Seems like he's there.

Maybe let me hang up, call him back.

Okay, Ray, you're not there, right?

Okay, I'm going to hang up, call him back.

These things happen.

I was afraid you were frozen too.

I was like, "I'm going to really..."

Because I never move and never see anything.

I was going to be like, "Oh man, I have a serious problem if everything just froze.

That would be really not good."

I think I finally bored Ray to death and he's like, "I'm done with this.

You guys keep talking."

Okay, let me...

Unable to add participant is unavailable.

Is it busy?

Does that mean it's giving business signal or something?

Maybe.

I wonder if he's trying to call back the number, which would, I think, be impossible.

I don't know.

We'll see.

Okay, everybody, thank you so much.

I think we have like 250 people.

This is obviously the most people we've ever had on here, so that is heartwarming.

I never wanted to get Ray on until I felt real comfortable with the mechanics of the

live stream stuff.

So, I feel more comfortable with it.

I'm happy to have this happen.

It's everything I ever dreamed of.

Thanks Georgie and massive thanks to Ray.

Let me call him back again.

I wonder if there's a time limit on the show.

Ray, you're back.

Okay.

We lost you for a second.

I didn't hear when it went dead.

I don't know either, Georgie.

Do you remember when we lost Ray?

It was kind of like a strange...

I thought my whole computer froze, but it didn't.

No, I was talking about the reintroduction of estrogen.

I was talking to one of the authors of a big study that came out this year and I emailed

him and I said, "How can you argue that estrogen is good considering that your own organization,

I think that person works for the NIH, has a webpage which says estrogen is a carcinogen

and a mutagen.

So, why would you argue that estrogen needs to be reintroduced and given to women?"

And he said, "Estrogen has non-genomic effects that don't involve the estrogen receptor and

acts as a powerful antioxidant.

So, if we give it to women in the right dosage, they will obviate the need for them to take

massive doses of vitamin E and C and it will provide them with this benefit of cardiovascular

protection and everything that these great antioxidants do."

So, I said, "So, how can you prevent estrogen from activating these receptors that you know

are causing cancer?"

And he basically said, "It's the dosage that makes the poison."

So, they're thinking that lower dose estrogen, it's going to be beneficial.

And I remember you said in several of these letters that a continuous uninterrupted exposure

to a low dose of estrogen is probably more harmful than getting estrogen spikes like

every few days or every few weeks.

Yeah, that was Alexander Lipschutz from about 1938 through the 1940s.

He did many animal experiments showing that even very small doses of estrogen, unless

they were interrupted with progesterone, were carcinogenic not just to the uterus and breast

but to the lungs, kidneys, brain, every organ would eventually develop estrogen-induced

cancer.

Well, if estrogen is, I mean, if cancer is a state of chronic reductive stress and estrogen

is a powerful reductant itself, doesn't that almost guarantee that estrogen will at the

very least contribute to an already established cancer?

Yeah, I don't know of any case where it doesn't.

To change gears a little bit, Ray, I feel like you're getting more popular on YouTube

and Twitter and things and people say all sorts of things about why you do what you

do.

And so, maybe we could just take a second to say like, why do you do what you do?

Just from your own words because so many people just basically make up things.

And so, I was just curious about your position on that.

Part of my understanding of what I'm doing here in the world, checking ideas and looking

for new perspectives, checking what people believe and trying to avoid the bad interpretations

that lead to bad actions and results.

It's always part of the same process of looking for something to do.

And maybe just an elevator pitch of your general hypothesis, like what you say on the front

of your webpage, the idea that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

I made a video about this not fairly recently, but it's like, because the nutrition world

is so stuck on different diets, obviously this whole conversation is about how complex

everything is, but your work gets reduced down to kind of a caricature of like you drink

two gallons of milk and two gallons of orange juice and a bag of sugar and then you're doing

your "Ray Peat Diet".

So, what is your perspective of what maintains health and then what is the differentiator

into the state of sickness?

There are two simple choices.

One that the genes have been laid out, have created a blueprint for creating the structures

and all the energy has to do is help to roll those out and once they're in place, just

to keep them running.

Like, that orientation leads to the idea that the less you live, the longer you will live.

The idea that you're going to burn up your, the whole apparatus will wear out the faster

you use it.

That all comes from the reductionist idea of a machine laid out in genetic blueprints.

It's a machine powered by a Rube Goldberg system, which is 20th century science.

And the other picture is the developmental picture that energy flowing from the sun through

the atmosphere is creating structures that the flow of energy itself generates structures

and the faster the energy flows, the more complex the structure becomes and the more

energy is saved in the system in the form of complexity of structure and the efficiency

increases, but the waste is part of what is powering it.

You don't have to think in terms of the efficiency of the system because the energy flowing through

the system, even though the oxidative apparatus is getting more efficient, you're building

a bigger system faster than the complexity and efficiency accumulates.

So it's the speed with which you can waste the energy while responding to it, building

your complexity that is holding up the whole structure.

And it's simply a picture of an ecosystem responding physically to energy.

It doesn't violate any of the known physical laws.

It uses them in more intelligent ways than the Rube Goldberg science of membranes, genes,

and so on.

And then you feel like you're following it, like this is not some idea that you cooked

up on your own.

Like you feel like you're following in a tradition of people like Szent-Györgyi, like Otto Warburg,

like Koch and others?

Yeah.

And even earlier, J.C.

Bose was one of my first inspirations.

I have a question.

Do you think that this openness to new ideas that these people had, it was sort of enabled

by their relatively faster metabolism?

And or do you think it was more or less childhood experiences that set them to be that way,

to be open to new opportunities and to actually actively seek them out?

I think a good intrauterine environment is a tremendous part of it.

You can, like Katharina Dalton's patients, the older kids, her patients had 95 average

IQ.

And just by treating the mothers with progesterone, her patients' kids had something like 135

average IQ.

The same mother, but better nourishment in utero.

And that kind of a head start gives you a lot of energy for absorbing shocks from the

oppressive environment.

Okay.

A question related to that, to expand a little bit on that, is, as I'm sure you're familiar,

sick people and sick animals tend to sort of retreat, avoid the real world and really

limit their spectrum of activity.

Some of them may even stop eating and basically they just want to keep to themselves and be

left alone.

Considering the fact that novelty and new experiences and being stimulated in the proper

way is so very therapeutic, do you think these sick organisms are making a pathological choice

that's not good for them based on their already poor health?

Or do you think it's actually a choice that at least in the short term, it's good for

them?

Basically, they don't have the energy to meet the demands of the world.

So they're retreating and hoping that they'll recover and then they'll come back.

Yeah.

Usually there's something specific that has happened.

They've eaten something or caught an infection, got poisoned and retreat and let the body

repair itself.

Paracelsus was one of the first people to put it into practice where he put his pharmacological

preparation on the sword that caused the wound and spared the patient the medication and

discovered that patients recovered much better without the medication.

Every time there's been an opportunity to compare medicated people with unmedicated,

the ones without medicine are much healthier.

So like animals, we could just take a week or two to retreat and maybe have a milkshake

now and then.

People would be much healthier, more likely to survive to old age.

So I guess initially it would be beneficial to retreat because you want to recover your

energetic resources, but do you think that over time if this becomes a chronic sort of

isolation self-imposed, that over time it actually becomes pathological, it starts to

hurt health because you've retreated so much from the world?

Yeah, there are people who do that, but they need new opportunities as well.

The culture isn't rushing to give them healthy, new, interesting opportunities.

In many cases, actually, they retreated because their doctor told them to.

It's, you know, they say, "Stay in your room until I call you and tell you it's okay to

get out."

To bring it back to politics a little bit, like, Ray, you think there's a way forward

with the kind of the system that we have at the moment?

Like you see glimmers of hope.

Like I remember when you were talking to Gavin for that interview on politics when Trump

had just been elected, like it seemed like, okay, this is different.

But then over time, he seems to have been absorbed into the same kind of stereotypical

problems of endless war and things like that.

But you do see a glimmer of hope in that whole system?

Do you know who Ann Coulter is?

I think of her as personification of Gooney reactionary philosophy.

But weirdly, she has made some of the most insightful comments about what's going on

now.

For example, comparing Bernie and Trump, she pointed out that the very things that

he campaigned on but didn't exactly fulfill, keeping us out of war, taxing the untaxed

corporations like Amazon and the banks, and stopping immigration.

Bernie has identical policies to what people were perceiving as Trump's campaign promises.

And she says that he is Trump's real threat.

And the polls, almost all of the polls are showing Bernie beating Trump by several points,

percentage points.

And most people in the public media, especially the Democrats, don't want to talk about that

possibility.

They think that the same people who saw a possibility in Trump avoiding war and taxing

the giant corporations, that's what they see in Bernie.

And so if he could run against Trump, then other realistic things then would be at issue.

Maybe Ann Coulter is espousing some of those, you introduced me to the term, but paleo-conservative

a little bit, some of those ideas?

Yeah, I don't know what really went through Ann Coulter's mind, but it was more perceptive

than I've seen any of the Democrat liberals doing.

Yeah, the paleo-conservatives are very consistent on avoiding war, but some of their policies

are really dopey.

Well, not to get too deep into a rabbit hole on this, but things like immigration and things,

I know there was, I forget the author, but it was like a book called Weapons of Mass

Migration.

And so this is not a topic I spend lots of time thinking about, but those types of things

to kind of influence the culture.

And I know the paleo-conservatives are against that, but again, I'm like reading Bucky Fuller

and him saying that there shouldn't be borders and things like that.

I agree with that type of view, but I'm also, I don't know, I'm torn between these different

points of view of migration and things.

And also being in a, living in different countries, it's not very easy to stay anywhere else aside

from Mexico or America.

Yeah, Bucky Fowler would say that the corollary is that you stop creating horror experiences

at home, like imposing a fascist on Honduras, where the elected president was improving,

he just wanted to raise the minimum wage and barely improve things, but definitely improving.

He was kicked out, Hillary Clinton oversaw putting a fascist in, and all of the progressive

labor people trying to get a minimum wage, they're being murdered, environmentalists

are being murdered.

And so obviously it's an improvement for them to try to get in the United States, but simply

stopping the oppression of third world countries would stop the immigration, improve conditions.

Hondurans would rather live in Honduras with a better standard of living than going to

the US and looking for work.

Erdogan and Turkey is following the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, allying with Al-Qaeda

and ending up creating more refugees and trying to send them to Europe to force Europe to

send an army in to give Syria to him.

If you simply stop supporting the murder and the oppression in places like Turkey and Honduras,

you would stop the immigration problem.

And that's from the imperialist US war machine.

Yeah.

I think it's more than the US involved here.

I think there are a number of imperialists in this world that are acting in concert with

the United States and often actually spearheading the war in certain places of the world, even

more than the United States.

I mean, Russia and Turkey, just as you said, Dr. Pied, and France and Germany, they all

have competing interests in the Middle East.

Israel, of course, Saudi Arabia, Iran.

So the United States gets a lot of the blame being the largest empire of them all, but

I think plenty of other countries that are at least as evil, and in this specific case,

probably even more so than the United States.

Just the number of soldiers maintained in other people's countries, the US is by far

the leader.

Yeah.

So I have a question for you.

I mean, given everything that we've talked about so far, and politicians getting elected

and then getting mired in the very swamp that they pledged to drain, and I've read history,

maybe definitely not as extensively as you, but I don't know of a single case of an empire

that got reformed.

Do you think that this empire or any empire can be reformed?

All I saw in history was empires either expanding, reaching their peak, and then either sort

of like gently fading into oblivion or collapsing almost overnight.

I never saw a case of a peaceful, semi-peaceful, or even constructive reform of an empire.

Yeah, I think theoretically, had that in mind, controlled collapse of the empire, withdrawing

the army more or less quickly, but the imperialists in the military, for example, don't want to

lose their power.

If Bernie could actually run against him, I think between them, they would possibly

recruit more supporters for bringing the empire down fairly quickly.

And what would that entail in your view, bringing down the empire?

Would it be simply end of the world wars that the military machine has started, or do you

mean a more radical social change at home?

If you freed up the Pentagon budget, for example, 90% of it putting the US on a scale with other

big countries, that amount of money removed from military destruction could far more than

finance any kind of Bernie Sanders programs, free college, health care for everyone, good

education, health care.

I just don't see the powers that be relinquishing that war machine, because that is the source

of their power.

And whoever gets elected, in my view, will be either undermined politically, or maybe

even worse.

Maybe this country has already seen an assassination of a president, and apparently, if you believe

other historical sources, attempted assassinations on other presidents that weren't playing ball.

I read the JFK, the unspeakable.

That gives a very close view of how Kennedy was backing off from the empire, and they

didn't want him to back off.

I think even Trump realizes that same mechanism being in action, and he has his own secret

service, for example.

The secret service pretty obviously was involved in killing Kennedy, and Trump knew enough

to have his own private security rather than the secret service.

So I didn't know that much about Trump leading up to the election, but his bailout from some

Rothschild family member, and then his close association with Sheldon Adelson, were there

clues that he was not going to follow through with what he was talking about?

Because he seems to be totally co-opted, and again, like you said, he's not doing the things

that he originally promised to do.

Yeah, he has repeatedly tried to sign the agreement with the Taliban.

Pompeo keeps sabotaging it, but Trump keeps going back and trying to keep the withdrawal

on schedule.

So I think more than anyone else in the government, he is making efforts to shut down the war

system.

And then how does somebody like Pompeo rise to power?

The guy is a total, like, total nut.

I just listen to some of his speaking, and it's just, I know it's nothing new, but it's

like shocking to even hear him talk about his kind of machinations and things about

what's going to happen in the future.

The Armageddon crowd was in Reagan's government too.

The Interior Minister said, "The end is near.

Let's mine it all.

Get it before the end."

Well, that really seems to be the premise they're all operating on, is that the end

is coming soon and nothing matters.

So that's why maybe that validates endless war and things like that.

That's literally true of a lot of those people like Pompeo.

Yeah, I wanted to tie in health and the collapse of the empire.

I mean, barring any kind of unpredictable collapse that the powers that be inflict on

themselves, if we want the reform, so to speak, or the control collapse to come from the people,

many of them, if not most, are in such a compromised state of health that they actually fear and

often actively oppose change.

At least that's my personal impression.

Don't you think this needs to be improved before some radical social change can actually

take hold?

Yeah, that's why I emphasize biology and health thinking to get people to realize that

they're dying on this path and that they have to change something radically.

To simply save their own health, they've got to change the system, which is pumping.

It isn't carbon dioxide.

It's a thousand different toxins being pumped into the atmosphere and food supply that is

killing people, vaccines and fake foods.

I think the movie Vaxxed and the various movements against genetically modified food and so on,

that's a wedge that people can start to see their own survival and their children depending

on bringing this industrial system to some kind of safe conclusion.

Okay.

In one of your first interviews with Danny, both of you were talking about panic and organizing

the panic.

That actually might have been carried.

Oh yeah.

But I think Dr. Peter opined on that as well.

So let's say the average person on the street, you give them all this information, they say,

"Okay, I see it in my own life.

I believe you.

I do understand that the system is killing me and I'm shaking with anxiety because I

don't know what to do."

What would be your response to a person like that?

Where do they start?

I think organizing, and that's exactly where the power system exists, is any impulse towards

organization gets interrupted.

All kinds of interruptions, firing them from their jobs so they don't have access to the

same resources.

New ways of organizing have to develop.

So do you think that the cultural push in the Western world towards extreme individualism

is a thinly veiled attempt at basically implementing this isolation so that people don't trust

each other and refuse to organize?

Yeah.

That's at the heart of preventing organization.

In the 1930s, there was a religious movement called moral rearmament.

That organization still exists, but it was a Christian movement with branches still in

this country and in Europe, religious reasons why you should destroy unions.

But it applies to any kind of social progress, making change that impinges on the corporations

and banks.

Right.

But at the same time, organized religion is probably a prime example of organization,

of getting people into groups and getting them to act upon a common goal.

So it could go either way, right?

If it's in the right hands, organization can be very powerful and impetus for change.

But if it gets compromised from within by agents of the powers that be and whatnot,

then people can be duped into sort of, they think they're working towards the common good,

but in reality, they're just maintaining the status quo.

The CIA and the FBI are several stages ahead of everyone organizing.

Anything you think of, they've got it covered.

Like Occupy Wall Street, they put organizers in who helped to prevent any constructive

organizational outcome, but they had snipers on the roof ready to kill the leaders if anyone

organized something that actually led to action.

Okay.

So what would be, I mean, I'm trying to, I guess, because regular people are aware of

that as well, many of them.

So they seem to have a choice between taking the risk at organizing and participating in

a group and then this group being undermined and they're working now, they're working in

favor of the empire versus avoiding participation in a bad activity, which you have also spoken

in favor of in the past, but then not really having enough power to enact change because

they're on their own.

Where is the, is there a middle ground or would it depend every single time on the situation?

I think it will change as cultural ideas evolve.

But I think the first thing is to just start lots of organizations, two or three people

in a group deciding on possible courses of action and creating networks of just little

personal interaction groups, but linking them up and being aware that the organizations

have to stay flexible in terms of basically about a million little groups with openness

to interact with other groups on different levels.

So basically create a large number of smaller organizations that will be much harder to

subvert just because the FBI doesn't have that manpower, that much manpower.

Yeah.

They've had, I don't know, maybe a million people attending to breaking up organizations.

But if you have 2 million little groups developing, it will overwhelm their manpower advantage.

Like the communists used to say that for every actual communist party member, there were

two or three FBI agents.

Yeah, I think that's what it sounds about, right?

Well, it seems like the FBI's ability and the CIA's ability to infiltrate movements

is like co-Intel Pro and I don't know, Ruby Ridge and like promoting domestic terror and

stuff or getting people to do things they otherwise wouldn't do.

Like what was that famous quote that like the FBI is behind most terrorist attacks in

the US or something like that?

Yeah, that has been documented over and over.

The people throwing rocks in demonstrations are usually local police or FBI.

What was it?

The Ferguson rap?

I'm not quite thinking of the right place, but there were provocateurs like breaking

windows and they were flown in on planes to go like cause havoc during peaceful protests

and stuff.

So yeah.

Yeah.

And like in the Ukraine, there were snipers shooting both sides.

And then people are so politically charged that they can't kind of see the forest for

the trees.

And then it's like this bad ideology on top of the corruption and the infiltration of

both sides.

I want to talk a little bit about consciousness.

Let's finish politics.

Let's talk about consciousness.

So we're up to about two hours.

And so Ray, I don't want to keep you all day.

Let's kind of end on consciousness.

And we have like 250 people listening right now.

So Ray, Georgie, thank you so much for making this possible.

Obviously a special live stream.

So yeah, go for it, Georgie.

Yeah.

In one of your books, actually, I think it was the Mind and Tissue where you said that

consciousness at its very basis is the orienting reflex, right?

So my question relates to physiologically, what does that look like?

Because there have been a number of studies coming out recently that are saying that medicine

and neurology have been looking at consciousness the wrong way.

They're calling it the heart problem of consciousness because by analyzing the brain and all of

the interactions of the neurons, they can't possibly explain the richness of personal

experience and they call this thing qualia.

And now they're proposing that maybe it's consciousness that's fundamental and it's

a property of matter.

It just varies in terms of its complexity depending on the object or the piece of matter

that we're actually observing.

So there's an ancient Hindu proverb which says that the spirit of God sleeps in stone,

dreams in animals, and awakens in man.

So my question is, how do you see that statement that consciousness is potentially a very basic

property of matter and it's the complexity of the structure of this matter that determines

how high level of this consciousness would be?

Does that sound about right?

Yeah, exactly.

I formulated it that way in 1957, I think was the first time I said consciousness is

the organized flow of energy through matter, but I have revised it to think of consciousness

as a substance in itself.

Since substances are defined empirically, matter is defined empirically as we experience

it.

So I think it's proper to think of consciousness as a substance.

For example, the donor-acceptor molecules contributing an electron flowing through muscle

causes it to contract.

I think that same donor-acceptor relationship activates a constant oscillation of excited

electrons through the neurons and between the neurons even, that it's a substance analogous

to the conductive electron bands in metal, but the electrons are existing on the soft

cytoplasmic material.

When the energy is properly activated by the oxidative acceptor function, raising electrons,

creating holes basically for electrons to flow through the properly oxidized substance,

it's like having a fire get wet when you have too many electrons.

It fills the holes and prevents the luminous function.

The perfume guy, I can't think of his name right now.

Tonini?

Was it Tonini or no?

No, a contemporary guy who was given...

Yeah, anyway, he sees odors as being resonant of the molecule, not the shape of the molecule,

but the electronic ability to resonate.

And that is going back to P.K.

Anokin, for example.

I think he saw his acceptor of action consciousness model as existing as an excited electron substance

which follows the rules of Gestalt psychology, actually space-filling material of electron

plasma, actually being what we experience, the light that we experience as red, white,

blue, green, and so on.

I think there is actually that frequency resonating in our brain tissue.

An odor, I believe the actual chemical pattern of that odor is what we experience.

The consciousness of smelling a chemical, that structure exists in space.

Each of the senses, I think, involves a certain frequency or energy level of the electrons

so that touch has a limited spatial ability.

The vision is the one that tends to be coherent at forming complexly coherent structures of

meaning.

So if I understand it correctly, as a result of metabolism, there is a directed electron

flow from food to oxygen, right?

And that donor-acceptor relationship causes the molecules in the cells to vibrate.

And if they vibrate at the same frequency, I'm guessing a certain amount of, like a minimum,

I guess a base number of neurons, if they vibrate at the same frequency, that creates

a resonance field, which is, I guess, the basis of consciousness.

And the qualia...

In one of his books, P.K.

Anokin goes through a series of articles showing that the mechanical behavior of the auditory

nerve, for example, can't carry the information that we actually experience flowing in on

the auditory nerve.

He has various arguments showing that much more information is carried per second than

nerve firing could possibly account for.

So it isn't information, it's actually the substance that we are experiencing.

So given the infinite richness of experience and the infinite richness of qualia, wouldn't

that imply that the brain cells would be capable of resonating in almost any frequency in order

to reproduce that infinite richness of reality?

I know that the frequencies have to be tuned very exactly.

And something like the psychedelics can, in effect, create new, more extensive pathways.

But I think the frequencies are all the same.

It's just lubricating new connections that become richer.

So you're saying potentially the same frequency could create the experience of the color green,

and then a different type of resonance, but with the same frequency, could create the

experience of listening to Mozart or something like that?

Yeah, the green comes in all degrees of saturation, mere green or psychedelic, full spectrum green

with meaning.

It resonates over into the feeling of religious meaning or the intensity of the meaning.

It isn't just one frequency, one meaning.

It's the intensity and saturation of that particular frequency.

And then the architectural structures built on those, so you could perceive Mozart or

Beethoven almost at the level of descriptive, rational listening, or you could have a full

energy flow, like a hi-fi consciousness where everything, all of the senses are resonating

full intensity.

So basically the range of frequencies that the brain is capable of producing is limited,

but their combination is infinite.

So that's what...

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

According to En-Okon, the auditory frequencies are...

We're actually transmitting the full range of frequencies and a young person can actually

experience all the way up to 35 or 40,000 cycles per second, like a porpoise.

And those are actually tuned processes of the electrons resonating at those actual frequencies

and the frequencies of nerve firing are nothing really related to consciousness.

They are like the infrastructure of maintaining energy production and substance distribution,

but the experience is floating over the infrastructure.

So speaking of resonance, and I'm sure you're familiar with the publications of Rupert Sheldrake,

I think is his name, about the morphogenetic fields and how we are essentially tapping

into the same pool of knowledge and any single person learning enriches that pool of knowledge

and then any other person could actually tap into that and sort of get access to that new

knowledge.

So...

He's in this morphogenic tradition going all the way to Goethe and earlier, but it's the

actual living side of science, not the abstract militarist, Platonist side of science.

So if two people are resonating, so to speak, if their consciousness are resonating and

almost merging in a sense, is there a limit to the distance that these people can be separated

with in order for this to occur?

Or is this like a global universal phenomenon, no matter where these consciousness capable

pieces of matter are?

Bucharach, did you ever read any of his books?

Adria Bucharach?

I haven't.

He, I think, makes a satisfactory case for the whole Earth resonance.

I think that the communication can probably be carried on like a carrier wave on the Earth's

resonance frequencies, modulating.

I think each brain can modulate that carrier wave of the Earth's electromagnetic field.

So the Schumann resonant frequencies could potentially be those carrier waves that allow

for the unification of consciousness of organisms on Earth?

Yeah.

The Canadian psychologist who invented the God helmet, an electronic helmet that stimulated

the brain so that people had religious experiences.

He suggests that we're tapping into the planetary carrier wave.

Okay.

So since we're on the sort of like resonance of consciousness and distance, as you've written

many times about David Bohm, and I'm a great fan of his work and writings, he was writing

that it's actually a universal consciousness that we're all part of, and that there is

a guiding pilot wave/carrier wave of which all of us are minor offshoots.

I didn't hear who you said.

David Bohm, the quantum physicist.

And he was basically saying that there's two kinds of order, the implicate order and the

explicate order, and then the explicate order arises out of the infinite implicate order

in a creative manner.

And we've talked about this process of constant creation of both matter and meaning and knowledge.

How do we participate in this creative process?

Because do we also create matter ourselves?

I mean, I know the Earth does, the stars do, right?

And probably the ethereal medium of the universe itself does, but how do we participate in

that creative process?

I don't know.

David Bohm was of the opinion that we are integral to the creative process of the universe,

but unfortunately he didn't elaborate how.

Yeah, I intuit that that's true, but I don't know how either.

I think it is most closely connected to this electronic jelly substance of consciousness

or whatever is flowing through any substance according to its structure.

But N. A. Kozirev noticed that entities in the universe, stars, planets, moons, and so

on, were emitting energy in proportion to their mass, and he believed that the passage

of time was a source of energy.

That simply says that energy comes out of the system, whatever matter is.

But he didn't have all of the planets' mass accurately connected to what was known about

their emission of heat.

But just in recent years, that was about 60 years ago he wrote that, but just in recent

years the satellites have measured the emission of the outer big planets and found that there

is an anomalous energy that corresponds to the mass rather than their position from the

sun.

So it's a big confirmation of Kozirev's idea that the mere passage of time and any

mass is going to be emitting energy.

So it's like we're all a fountain of energy of some sort.

So a question on Kozirev and stars, because actually that was one of my, that was the

top question I was going to ask you tonight and you brought it up yourself.

As you know, he did a lot of experiments on measuring and creating time based on different

processes.

So dissipating process that basically emit heat, he said that they produce time and that

other processes that are sort of, you know, dropping in temperature, they can actually

accept time, they can absorb time.

So what do you think time is in terms of a physical entity?

My best guess is that Forrest Dudley was right and he described it as the neutrino sea.

At that time neutrinos were thought to have no energy, but he proposed that they do have

energy and that they associate with matter according to its mass and that nuclear, so-called

nuclear energy is converting in conventional thinking, converting mass to energy or in

this view, it's simply being through time, passing through time as a mass that allows

these neutrinos to interact.

And crystals, Forrest Dudley suggested that the crystalline structure of matter was in

some way in charge of how the neutrinos resonate, that there's a space-filling resonance of

neutrinos corresponding to the orderly arrangement of crystals that he suggested could cause

nuclear reactions to occur unpredicted.

And simultaneously with his proposing that theory, an experimental physicist named Anderson

observed that a monolayer of carbon isotopes on aluminum foil had a non-random nuclear

decay.

Dudley had predicted that sort of thing, that an orderly arrangement of matter such as a

surface would interact with the neutrino sea in a way that would draw on the energy of

the nucleus.

But anyway, my inference from those two bits of data is that the brain, this structure

of donor-acceptor activated gel of electrons.

My idea is that this structure of the brain is like the surface of the aluminum foil,

able to tap into the energy of the neutrino sea, and this is where the introduction of

novelty as well as energy comes from.

Understood.

I read an interpretation of Aristotle recently that said that, it was by a quantum physicist,

and he said that everybody has struggled with the definition of time, of what time is and

how it relates to us.

And apparently Aristotle got pretty close.

He said in one of his writings, apparently, I haven't seen the actual one, but he said

that time is simply the amount of potentiality that has converted to actuality for any given

system.

Does that sound about right?

Sounds right.

Okay, and last question related to consciousness.

If the stars are perhaps the most intense entities with the most intense metabolism,

for lack of a better word, would you say that they possess a type of consciousness, perhaps

even higher than ours?

I would think a galaxy, the streaming shape-creating forces of galaxies are probably conscious.

There's no more streaming energy through matter than a galaxy in action.

But I think our brains are rivaling the galaxies for the complexity of activated substance

that we're trying to imitate the galaxy energy with actual physical creation of substance

at the edge of the process.

That's remarkable.

I don't know if you know, but Aristotle said that in his classification, there were very

few pure actualities.

And he said that humans, galaxies, stars, and I think he mentioned one other thing,

cosmological, I'm forgetting what it is, but in his view, those were the only actualities.

So he was placing them at the same level, I'm guessing, in terms of development as you

are.

Yeah, that sounds right.

Okay.

I don't have any other questions.

Speaking of, this is neither here nor there, but have you guys, there's like a special

type of camera that's fairly new that can accurately zoom in on stars and planets.

And the footage these people are taking of the stars and planets looks literally like

nothing I've ever seen before, but they look like big balls of kind of multicolored energy.

Like that's how I would describe it.

Ray, are you familiar with that at all?

No.

I'll forward you with them.

But it's like, it's a lot of the flat earth people use it to say that NASA is lying about

everything.

But I think it's just interesting that we're actually like, just random people are able

to take a really interesting video of stars.

Okay.

So I guess we'll end it there.

Let me just read.

So Ray, I don't know if you know how it works, but people do super chats and a big group

of people have accumulated $794.

So whatever YouTube takes of that, I will forward to you, Ray.

And I appreciate you being on here and let me just read.

We won't be able to get to people's questions because that would, we would be on here for

hours.

Thank you for that.

Monty did multiple super chats.

Thank you for that.

Gio, thank you for that.

Turkish Postman, I think we just got one more, DBO514.

Thank you guys so much.

I apologize for not being able to read your questions.

Georgie and I can like devote an entire episode to trying to answer these questions.

Any parting words, Ray?

Can you tell people how to obtain your newsletter?

You can email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com and see if you can have people come up with

ideas and create new organizations.

I love it.

I love it.

So, and then Georgie, any parting words?

A question for Dr. Peat in terms of ideas for scientific studies that he thinks are

worth replicating.

I mean, I haven't mentioned it.

I mentioned in previous podcasts with Danny, but I'm privileged enough to start being able

to make my own studies and I was thinking of doing one on essential fatty acid depletion

and trying to prove that all of the, because there's only one by the Burrs in the 1930s.

So, I'm trying to prove that really all of these symptoms of fatty acid, essential fatty

acid deficiencies that they were seeing were just deficiencies of specific nutrients and

maybe insufficient amount of calories and things like that.

Anything else, any other seminal idea that you think is really currently being twisted

and poisoning the scientific and the medical world that we can try and test and sort of

show the exact opposite?

If I think of something, I'll contact you.

Okay.

Understood.

Thank you.

Awesome.

Ray, stay on the line.

I'm going to kind of wrap things up.

Guys, thank you so much.

Like 250 people in the chat right now.

Everybody, thank you so much.

We'll see you guys.

I'll see you next week, I think with Tim.

Okay, guys, take care.[Music]

Okay, we are live on YouTube. Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov. Ray, I interrupted you. You were saying some really important, critical things and so I just want to get those on record.

I was asking you initially about China, Brzezinski, the Rockefeller Technocratic Society, you were mentioning Event 201, Fort Detrick, and kind of the culmination of a bunch of, I don't know, larger global plans and pushing society in a specific direction that has been talked about for a long time.

Yeah, and there was a commission on defense preparations using artificial intelligence that came out about two years ago that said that at the rate Chinese economy has been growing,

the world will be centered on Chinese production, development of artificial automation, automatic factories, and the U.S. for various reasons would not be able to keep up with that extrapolated progress.

And that the only way this commission could see to prevent China from taking over the world in 10 years would be to stop the world economy as a whole, turn off, ruin the whole world economy.

And then these other things, claiming that there was a virus released last November, doing the news releases of a leaky lab and Fort Detrick preparing pathogens,

all of that reinforced by China's cooperation in creating that huge quarantine that was acting out the plan to ruin the world economy as a way to save the ruling system,

to keep the U.S. empire intact by ruining everything, meaning ruining small business primarily so that there can be an immediate takeover by monopoly corporations and finance,

simplify the whole economy with basically everyone being a low wage employee but working to overtake China on the matter of artificial intelligence production.

I have a question here. So let's say China becomes the leader in artificial intelligence, what are those 1.4 billion people there going to do? What do you think China's idea of its own population would be? How would they participate if eventually everything becomes automated?

I'm not sure they've thought about that but they have basically a humane concept of how capitalism is working. They have actually almost succeeded in eliminating poverty.

China was one of the poorest countries when they started and they have actually seriously brought up the lowest economic category.

Okay. So basically this event is similar to that quote you gave once about the Vietnamese and the Americans saying we have to destroy this village to save it from the Vietnamese. So they're doing the same thing now with the world economy to save it from the Chinese, they have to destroy it?

Exactly.

Okay.

So I was a little bit wrong. They're not in solidarity with China. They're doing all these things to protect what they've built. Is that right?

Yeah. They were taking profits from the industry in China but reached a point where they saw that China as an economy was becoming the center of the world, making the world dependent on their production and that was structurally interfering with the US idea of empires.

In which military bases were the essence of organization and the Chinese were making the flow of goods the means of organization.

What does quarantine and lockdown, presuming that's towards a depopulation type of effort, what does that have to do with maintaining the empire? Are the citizenry getting out of control and that's why they have to put these ridiculous measures in place to clamp down on the people?

That's part of it to justify taking over the internet requiring vaccination and subordination of all sorts. But I think mostly it's part of destroying all of the middle class competition for the giant monopolies.

Do you think technocracy is a worthwhile concept? Is that useful for explaining what's going on? Was it coined by Brzezinski in Between Two Ages?

Oh no. Veblen was the first person who started talking about how you could eliminate labor and create abundance.

Then the people who called themselves the technocrats incorporated started, the founder of technocracy knew Veblen and adopted his view of the economy.

Did you know any of the old technocrats used to drive grey cars with the yellow and red yin yang symbol on the side?

I didn't know that.

People thought they were maybe fascist sympathizers or something but they were actually just very naive about how the world works.

They took these calculations from Veblen and subsequent economists like John Maynard Keynes in 1930.

He wrote an article saying that by 2030, 100 years from when he wrote it, he said that by discounting plagues and world wars, people won't be working any more than 15 hours a week.

When I was a kid, that was part of the environment. The work week was getting shorter and that was the predicted future.

It wasn't just the technocracy people by name but they were outstanding in how optimistic they were that the people who owned things were going to let the engineers run them intelligently and efficiently.

That constantly was running into interference with concentration of wealth and control.

The progress towards the 15-hour week was more or less continuous despite those interferences with the engineer category.

In 1980, it was the turning point. Reagan and the progress of the middle and working class took a sharp turn.

The GDP kept increasing. Productivity kept increasing but wages started decreasing. The upper 1% and 1/10 of 1% started getting all of the rewards of increasing production.

The economy started declining. The economy started declining. The economy started declining. The economy started declining and the economy started declining.

I was listening to a conversation between Patrick Woods and James Corbett. Patrick Woods has written a few books on technocracy. He was important to point out that originally it was more like a Bucky Fuller type of future.

I think what you said, you're only working a few hours in the future. Rockefeller and Brzezinski and that et al. co-opted the term for their dystopian, brave new world type of future.

Yes, definitely. It started with the CIA and Eisenhower and the Green Revolution.

It was being applied in agriculture, turning farming into agribusiness and agri-industry rather than producing mixed foods for consumption.

It was producing soybeans for profit. That started with Rockefeller and Eisenhower in 1952.

I have a question. If agriculture has been so industrialized to mostly focus on profit and not necessarily produce the foods that people need, then how come it needs such massive subsidies from the government?

I live in DC and I know some people that are involved in lobbying on behalf of agricultural organizations.

They're saying that if these farmers, no matter how massive they are in the Midwest, don't get their government subsidies even one season, they're going under.

The government has been financing the upward distribution of ownership in all sorts of ways.

The funds going to people owning only 10,000 acres and such was slowing the progress of the great technocrats.

They're going to let those so-called relatively small farms of 10,000 or 15,000 acres go under to be consumed by the ones controlling a million acres.

We can step back a little bit. Ray, in one of your newsletters, you quoted Gore Vidal and you said, "The people have no voice because they have no information."

That reminded me of – at first, I wasn't sure if it was accurate or not, but William Casey, the CIA director in 1981, he said, "Well, no, our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."

Then there's some dispute on whether that quote is real or not. Then Barbara Honiger said she was the one that quoted him.

She, on Quora, a website of questioning and answers, basically says, "Seriously, this quote is real, and I was the one who said it."

I just say that because this is not something that's really – I mean, the concept of fake news is more prevalent than it ever has been, but what is your take having a wide perspective on how the news has changed over time?

William Casey, the CEO of Google, said, "The public news is getting more controlling, more false, and dumbed down so that they're just giving instructions every day on what you should believe today."

It's horrifyingly effective with this plague thing, how people fell for it. Without any data at all, the decisions were made that a new kind of coronavirus was very infectious and very deadly.

No data in support. My first thought was, "Do they have guilty insider information that it was designed in the lab and they know that to be the case?"

If they weren't the designers of it, otherwise, there's no sane reason for saying those things that it's very infectious or very dangerous, because they just weren't doing the tests to see what was making people sick

or measuring the changes of sickness in relation to previous years.

I was looking at the CDC's report, and all of their actual cases and infections and deaths were right on the typical flu season mortality, sickness, and hospitalization.

As the tests became available by the millions around the first of April, suddenly, flu mortality dropped as fast as the stock market had fallen earlier.

It was like a cliff falling off as the millions of tests became available, and the steep rise of the news talked about, a sudden gigantic speed of communication caused this vertical rise in the incidents and deaths from the coronavirus.

But the bigger curve of general respiratory mortality was right on previous year patterns.

It was just coronavirus replacing influenza and syncytial and other respiratory viruses.

When it became available, the official definition of polio was changed, and other conditions that had been causing paralysis suddenly disappeared.

As polio was epidemic, things like aseptic meningitis were either rising to replace the disappearing polio, in other words, the definition was the only thing that changed.

Paralysis stayed the same, and so if you eliminated polio by saying that it didn't fit the definition of what was causing paralysis, then the vaccine could get the credit for it.

The same thing was done in the opposite direction with cancer from the 1940s through the 1950s. They increased the definition of cancer of the breast and uterus, for example.

Things that had been non-cancer became cancer, and so if you cure all of these cases of non-cancer, it shows that your treatment is effective.

But if you look at the actual death from cancer, the deaths from cancer increased exactly at the speed that the treatment for cancer increased.

By definition, they were having a tremendous success in curing cancer by creating a strawman of disease and curing it, but meanwhile, the bystander patient was dying at a higher rate.

I think that accounts for why the coronavirus deaths are tending to displace flu virus deaths.

I have a question in regards to the coronavirus. If the Chinese are aware that this has been dropped at their doorstep as a warning, they must have done some testing internally and probably confirmed that this is not nearly as dangerous as what we hear on TV.

Do you think they took the bait, so to speak, and quarantined the entire country? Was it sort of an exercise in their own police state for future purposes, or were they really concerned that maybe this could have unforeseen lethality later down the road?

As far as I can tell, it could be either of those equally.

Okay. All right.

What do you make of the flip-flopping of the WHO saying, or another organization saying, "Oh, masks don't help. You don't need to wear them. Oh, you must wear a mask," and now it's basically illegal to not wear a mask?

How could that happen? Were they just not coordinated to the story, the narrative on the public?

Yeah. They didn't plan it all out with that meeting that came up with Event 201. They left some details that were sloppy.

Can you talk a little bit more about Event 201 and then also this lockstep scenario narratives from the Rockefeller Foundation? And then also, sorry to throw so much at you, but Harry Vox really predicting – once you know the plan, it's kind of easy to predict, but Harry Vox's scarily accurate prediction where he just – he kind of calls all of this in 2014.

But Event 201, lockstep, and these kind of "scenarios" that they run, what are they for? Why are they doing these things?

Why are they doing which things? I mean, why are they doing it right now?

Well, so the lockstep document I think came out in 2010, but I would imagine most of the public is not familiar with this Rockefeller Foundation document and things like 201.

But they seem to see these things out in the public, and then when you bring them up, that they're identical to what we're experiencing now, you're called a conspiracy theorist.

So I mean when you read something like this, what is your take on it?

Oh, that they really were planning this. I think Harry Vox is right. You can't imagine them as being more evil than they really are.

We're always short in our estimation of how bad they are.

I have a more sinister explanation why they're doing this, why they're seeding the public with these things.

I mean, now that everything is being monitored online, it's sort of – they probably have a list, and I'm sure they have a list of people who are kind of reading between the lines and realizing what's really going on.

It's very similar to the leaders of the Occupy Wall Street movement. If you remember, they had snipers that were ready to take them out.

I'm not saying there are snipers for all of us waiting on the roof, but I think I would guarantee you that we are all on some kind of a list if we fit the profile of people who are essentially reading these documents and realizing what's going on.

Because the vast majority of people that are around me that I've mentioned these things to, they're so out of it that basically you can't even talk about these topics without being considered a nut.

At the same time, I'm pretty sure that there's probably an agency somewhere keeping track of who is saying what online and who can become a potential leader of a resistance movement.

Yeah, I think doing everything possible on the internet and telephones and so on is important, but besides that, people have to start actually getting in touch personally and passing messages personally,

organizing on the ground level, literally, and establishing networks within the system and hoping to find contacts within the surveillance structure.

Like my experience in the past, just with trying to go abroad to teach, that involves surveillance to the extent that one of my old friends who turned out to be sort of my overseer for some government agency,

he said he would tell me when we retired, but he died before retiring.

But his wife confirmed that he was in surveillance.

But every time I would have an idea, like to go to teach in Nicaragua or Salvador or something, he would somehow locate my location, even though I hadn't kept in touch with him and didn't have a telephone.

But he would somehow find my address and get in touch and ask what I was doing and then say, "Don't do it."

You have direct experience with this?

Yeah. I was never aware of it happening, except when someone like that would intervene.

He was one of the other union people from the Northwest. We knew him as a fanatical anti-marijuana person because he knew that that would be used to damage the union workers if he was tainted by marijuana.

But the night before he was to fly to San Salvador with the other union guys, his apartment was arrested, marijuana was planted, and he was put in jail to miss his flight.

As far as I knew, he didn't know why it happened. He wasn't prosecuted. Charges were dropped.

But the guys that went there were sitting in a restaurant starting to get organized, and the army murdered them all.

So my view was that he had his friend somewhere in the government that protected him by having him framed.

Are you familiar with the writings and the interviews of this lady called Kay Griggs?

I didn't hear exactly what you said.

There is this lady, her name is Kay Griggs, and she has been posting interviews about the power structure within the government and all the conspiracies.

And she verbatim said pretty much what you just did was done to her.

She was married to a very high-level former NATO official. He was in charge of, I forgot what it was, some kind of a policy for NATO.

So he was the second or third in command at the NATO headquarters in Europe, and she was married to him for about 20 to 30 years.

And he was basically, his job, he was basically an assassin, and he was either killing people or helping kill people who were subverting the empire.

And apparently after she started speaking about these things, he promptly divorced her. He disappeared.

If you try to look for his name, he cannot be found online.

But more importantly, she said that people would randomly break into apartments or hotels where she would go out and stay there.

And basically this would be a message of saying, be mindful of what you're saying because we can frame you in any way we want.

And if we don't like what you're saying, maybe something much worse would happen.

Yeah, I'm being nearsighted and generally tending to be absent-minded and such.

I never would notice things, but whenever this guy who was my surveillance person was with me,

like I would come back to the school, put my key in the lock, and pull it out and find shreds of paraffin on it.

I said, "What was that?" And he said, "Oh, sometimes they do that to make a copy of your key so they can break in."

By the way, it was me. Don't worry about it.

Other times I wasn't noticing someone being like a clown surveillance person who was doing a show of being sneaky but looking ridiculous,

hiding behind a skinny light post, for example.

I wouldn't have noticed it except my friend pointed it out.

And then the guy wrote a number in the dust of my windshield and then it disappeared.

I said, "I wonder why he wrote that number."

And my friend said, "That looks like an immigration tourist card number."

So I pulled out my tourist card and it was my immigration number that this guy had written.

But I wouldn't have noticed it if the surveillance guy hadn't pointed it out to me.

So maybe that's what protected you. You were so absent-minded. Their signs weren't working.

I think part of his instruction at that point was to try to get me to leave the country.

Okay. So that was Nicaragua, you said? Or El Salvador?

What was that?

Was that in Nicaragua or El Salvador?

No, that was Mexico.

Mexico. Okay.

Can we talk a little bit about Bill Gates' role in this?

And this Politico article says, "Meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates."

And so I also – somebody called him a pandemic hobbyist, which I thought was funny.

But what is your take?

I don't imagine that very, very, very powerful people give as many interviews as Bill Gates.

So what do you think he's an extension of, Ray?

Oh, he likes to hobnob with the very top bankers, the Rockefellers and Rothschild type.

And I think he's in the network, CIA, IBM, creating his business and his billions.

And he's right from the start knowing somewhat what the scheme is.

But he's sort of a microcephalic type who follows orders but doesn't do much else.

It's funny because my dad worked for IBM, and he worked in for computers my entire life.

And all I heard when I was growing up was, "What a son of a bitch Bill Gates was."

And so it's kind of funny to me that he's reformed his image so much as being this Christ-like savior with the vaccines.

And it reminded me of John D. Rockefeller because apparently he was hated by everybody.

And then he had like a campaign to reform his image, I think.

Yeah, and public health. He got poor people to wear shoes in the South and did lots of good things.

I always thought that a powerful doctor is a contradiction of terms, but apparently I'm the only one who thinks that way.

I tried to bring it up to a few doctor friends of mine, and they said, "No, it's perfectly fine."

I said, "Well, a powerful doctor to me would mean somebody who cured cancer."

And they said, "No, no, no. You're living in a fantasy world.

A powerful doctor means who has the potential of one day being either the president or running global health."

Which seems exactly what Bill Gates seems to be aiming towards.

Yeah. And the world economy is part of world health.

You want to keep people just sick enough that they have to consume the drugs and be under the control of the doctors and the drug companies.

Do you think they've gotten the science down, you know, improved enough to the point where they can say,

"On average, we can control how long a person lives and exactly when they die, when their worth to the system essentially is exhausted."

Basically, they reach either a level of age or a level of sickness where they're no longer worth to the system to continue maintaining them.

So more or less on an average level, they can engineer the death of the average citizen.

Yeah. And when someone is in the hands of a healthcare system where the military or the insurance company or the healthcare corporation,

where they're responsible for their final sickness, it's well established that the final sickness is the most economical disposition.

Morphine is the standard treatment for cancer even though it's recognized for at least 100 years that it makes cancer grow faster.

But it's a very cheap way to finish them off and save money.

Going back to what you talked about Bill Gates kind of being born into this hobnobbing with the elites and in an old interview with Bill Moyers,

Bill Gates says his dad was head of Planned Parenthood.

And so I know people have a knee-jerk reaction to that, but I feel like it's fairly well talked about,

like Margaret Sanger and that being kind of a racist depopulation strategy.

And then Bill Gates' dad is head of that Planned Parenthood and Bill Gates' dad being associated with Rockefeller.

Oh yeah, they talk about that, the efficient population and the things that will not prolong poverty,

get rid of the people who are occupying the land that needs to be made efficient.

And then a picture surfaced with Anthony Fauci with William H. Gates, David Rockefeller, Soros and just the elite of the elite.

And so again I'm not sure how many people have seen these types of pictures, but they're just interesting, the connections between these people.

Yeah, Fauci is another person that follows orders and administers punishment and knows how to very efficiently, bluntly and crudely make things look right on the surface.

While stealing people's ideas and blocking their research.

And do you have any idea why, again, just the relationship of Trump and this clique of people, like why, like Trump seems semi-skeptical of what was happening.

Why do you think he was letting Fauci kind of run the show?

I think it was actual indecision, not being a complete insider.

I have a question about the general economy. Let's say things now reopen, because that's, Trump wants this to happen in order to get re-elected for lack of a better reason.

How do you foresee things continuing? I mean, do you think that, because it seems to me that the industry, the massive industry that generates profits for all the bankers and the elite, has gotten to the point where it cannot really produce profit on its own.

It needs government money. That's really where most of the profit comes from. They're literally being handed money out.

This cannot really be sustainable. I mean, at some point, even the dumbest member of the public will say, well, hold on a second.

We've already experienced two once in a generation recessions/depressions.

We have an entire generation calling them the millennials who have no concept of ever owning a house or retiring or having a vacation longer than a week.

Even the regular people in the street are probably going to start to question this mode of operating where a crisis is manufactured now every, less than every 10 years.

Do you think this will be like the last such event before it collapses?

If they can keep their attention on curing a mythical virus, I think they're keeping people under control.

But they have their different layers of control ready.

If one doesn't work, they have the other. The money went right into the big corporations that failed to put it to use employing people.

It created some temporary jobs, but most of the money didn't really get to the people.

As they realize that, maybe they'll send out another wave of money if it's needed. But if people start going into the streets demanding change, then they have their other levels of responding.

If we hit unemployment levels of 50 million people, you can't bail all of these people out.

They're not willing. They're sending $1,200 checks as a one-time thing.

At some point, these people will need to eat.

If you're not willing to create a system of universal basic income, which it seems they're not willing currently, these people have to do something.

If the economy is destroyed and all of these large corporations need money but not really employees, you have to do something with those 50 million people.

I think this epidemic has given them an acceleration of what they were planning.

They'll let up on it to relieve revolutionary pressure if needed, but will be ready with something else, terrorism or something different to get people's attention.

Right.

That process started in 1980 with the working and middle class failing to share in the increased productivity.

But in these 40 years, how many people have caught on to the fact that everything is getting worse steadily for a whole generation?

It's very slow to – the implications are being deflected by the daily news.

Public schools, colleges and the mass media are constantly telling people that they're still in the middle class.

Ryan, Have you been privy to any of the ProDoctor propaganda? Like, if I scroll through that

application Instagram, which is very popular, it's many different videos of doctors dancing

and status having signs put together saying stay home. And there seems to be a concentrated

effort to promote doctors. And then James Corbett put together that he said similar to the veterans

of 9/11, the new heroes doctors will be to push an agenda, presumably so you don't fight

back when you're given your many, many vaccines.

Yeah, it's all part of total subservience. 50 years ago, I was saying that it won't be

long until they keep people on the assembly line by installing a screw in their skull

and attaching it to a trolley. So they can only go from the bathroom to the lunchroom

to the assembly line and then home. But with the telephones, they don't need the trolley

wire.

I think the social distancing right now has a I mean, I suspect it has a more more sinister

role as well. They're preventing the you know, people from organizing right? If there's a

sufficient number of people who are willing to not take up in arms, but at least start

an organization like Occupy Wall Street, by telling them stay home and by mandating it

for them to stay home. It's an effective means of control because you can only achieve so

much over a phone or computer.

Yeah, and that way they don't waste their pepper spray.

Ray, did you anticipate this being the kind of I don't know what the right word is the

the like a medical problem or a pandemic health problem being the I mean, I can't think of

the word the initiation for the catalyst for the change like into the type of new world

or a new world order situation is this kind of part of why you do what you do, because

it all kind of makes sense now, given how this thing is playing out.

Yeah, the health thing has always been my sense of a point of reality, where you might

be able to if you can't show anyone what's happening politically, militarily, in the

outside world, you maybe can get their attention on the fact that it's affecting their health,

and you can get them to contact whatever reality they have the potential for and maybe work

from there. And I found that the progressive people were totally out of contact with that

sort of reality. But the far right, I found people coming to my lectures, it was only

the extreme right that was interested in health and survival. And the same people who were

saying that, that the communists were putting fluoride in the water. You can open that up

and get them to realize that the corporations and the doctors are doing the equivalent of

putting fluoride, polluting their vital bodily fluids.

Well, speaking of that, an article in 2014 said, "The WHO campaign is not about a mass

sterilization exercise. Kenyan doctors find anti-fertility agent in UN tetanus vaccine."

And I guess this vaccine was laced with HCG. So, you, given your understanding of endocrinology

is that the type of thing that's... I know there's aluminum and mercury and the adjuvants

are really harmful, but do you think the underlining idea behind vaccination is sterilization?

Well, they found HCG in some of the African vaccines. And it's known that that will sterilize

you at least for a few years. And that was designed, you know, the CIA doesn't announce

that they're doing it or going to do it, but they plan for its possibility. And then someone

always figures out how to sneak it out into the world.

But you might've answered it, but like, I guess, do you think the, like why Gates et

al is so kind of determined to give people vaccines, is that just to make them sicker?

Or do you think there's a specific like kind of nefarious purpose? Like they will add something

that will be anti-fertility?

Oh yeah. I think his background in population control is right there on the surface.

Well, it's hilarious that like the elite have several things in common, but one is we must

depopulate. And then at the same time, Bill Gates and others are saying to take this vaccine

so we can save your lives. It doesn't even register in just a basic way. It's very odd.

The idea of preventing epidemics by like the old 120 year ago Rockefeller idea of giving

people shoes and food and curing endemic disease that way, that's now too expensive. Vaccines

are a matter of economy. The known effects of vitamin A and vitamin D just making massive

improvements in disease resistance of all sorts. That's more expensive, as cheap as

those are, it's more expensive than a vaccine, not even counting the depopulation effects.

I don't know if you see that, that sort of article. I mean, I'm sure that's the one you're

referring to, the Kenyan one. It only talks about vaccinating the girls and HCG has a

known anti-fertility effect in girls, but apparently it works also in boys. And I found

about this in a little bit of a roundabout way. Apparently if a male buys a pregnancy

test in the pharmacy and pees on it and it comes back positive, that is a biomarker for

testicular cancer. Apparently the levels of HCG are elevated in males with testicular

cancer. Conversely, there's some serious research suggesting that if a male chronically uses

a specific amount of HCG, they may give themselves testicular cancer, sort of like a permanent

infertility agent, which goes way beyond what it can do in girls.

Yeah, it's dangerous stuff. I've been warning people not to use it as a diet weight loss

method because of that effect on estrogen and cancer.

Are its effects similar to the human growth hormone, the one that people also inject with?

No, not exactly, but yeah, that one has its age-promoting effect, thickening the basement

membranes and so imitating age changes. But the chorionic gonadotropin increases estrogen

production and estrogen is produced by any type of cell in the body. So you don't want

to have untimely stimulation of estrogen.

It's so ironic that most of the Hollywood elite are injecting with HGH specifically

for anti-aging purposes. I guess that's why they look so horrible when you see them on

TV.

Well, Ray, George and I were talking yesterday about, I'm looking at a picture of John D.

Rockefeller and this big new Brzezinski, Soros. Why do you think these people personify or

they aesthetically look evil? Have you ever thought about that? John D. Rockefeller is

one of, I'm not saying this to be mean, but he's objectively really disturbing looking.

Why do you think that is?

Yeah, the old women in that picture with the Rockefellers and other giants of civilization,

they all look like, Hollywood couldn't design evil characters as well as that.

Well, I was looking up some of these people and who was it? Maybe it was Irene Diamond.

I think she might have been involved in AIDS research and things. Then somebody mentioned

on Twitter somewhere that this whole thing is really similar to AIDS. I was too young

to have gone through that, but do you recall similarities? I'm looking at a magazine cover

right now from life in July 1985 when I was born and it says, "Now no one is safe from

AIDS." It has a picture of a young boy, a family, and some evil military person.

No, I don't think there's much similarity except that they both damage your immunity

and make you sick. Did I ever tell you the story of the guy from Fort Detrick that told

me about the AIDS research 11, 12 years before AIDS broke out? In 1969, this guy came to

one of my free university classes and hung around afterwards and wanted to talk to me

as a biology graduate student, someone that might take him seriously. I didn't even take

him seriously enough to get his name and contact information, but he said he had quit his job

at Fort Detrick because the people were seriously designing a virus that would be racially selective

to kill black people specifically. At that time, nothing had been published on ethnic

magnetic tags that a virus could attach to, but two or three years later, the first papers

were published coming out of Fort Detrick, exactly what he had said but without the purpose

defined. My molecular biology professors honored those as great progress in science.

Do you think the plan changed at some point from creating a virus to kill black and gay

people to doing something different, like the dysgenics kind of thing of poisoning everybody

and just making everybody basically have brain damage?

Yeah, the plan is constantly developing. It wasn't perfected at an early date. It develops.

And you think like the Rand Corporation and Tavistock and all these think tanks, they

are making the plans for the elites and then they're being kind of put into place and

we're the recipients.

Yeah, the universities are working out the details often without knowing it. I think

my molecular biology professors were just jerks, but they were playing right into the

whole scheme.

Well, they depend on government money like almost every other academic these days, right?

Yeah.

So I have a question about these viruses that are being engineered to harm the world. You

will think that the people who create the poison would want to have the antidote for

themselves. Do you think there is something behind the scenes that the elite possesses

to protect itself? Or do you think the science is simply so pathological that they can create

the poison but they can't create the remedy?

They probably know about vitamin D.

Oh, GCMAF, right? That's what came up a few times in terms of treatment.

Which was that?

GCMAF. Apparently it's like a receptor that's activated by vitamin D.

Doug?

The idea of damaging the brain, the mass vaccination I think is objectively having that effect.

I looked at brain size in relation to body size trends over the decades. And right when

massive child vaccination expanded in the U.S., that was the first decade that the brain

didn't keep pace with the body growth. In several countries around the world, the brains

got either got smaller or didn't enlarge while the body did enlarge. So the brain-body

ratio has shrunk, but starting with the decade of the '80s.

And I'm sure you've seen the studies showing that the IQ, the average worldwide IQ, after

enjoying a century of rising, suddenly started dropping around the late '60s and at this

point is 30% lower than what it was in the '70s.

Yeah. But even the mass of the brain is now shrinking.

Wow.

I was perusing a PDF called like philanthropic influence and the global health agenda. And

it was like, who sets the agenda talking about the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.

And they said, "The Gates Foundation prioritization of the vaccine solution for multiple health

problems reflects the foundation's preference for interventions with quick, measurable,

and visible solutions. One of GAVI's," and that's an acronym for something, "Senior

Representatives reported that Bill Gates often told him in private conversations that he

is vehemently against health systems. He basically said it was a complete waste of money and

that there was no evidence that it works. So I will not see a dollar or cent of my money

to go to strengthening of health systems." And so I'm not pro health, I mean, doctors

or anything, but doesn't that just speak volumes that they think vaccines and not cleaning

up, like not cleaning up poverty or like you said, giving supplements of basic things like

vitamin D and A, and they have to go with these experimental vaccines with massive conflicts

of interest. It just seems totally insane.

Yeah. I'm against medicine in general. So Medicare for everyone would be a sort of an

ideological thing, but it would make many things worse.

Well, Ivan Illich, "Preservation of the sick life of medically dependent people in an unhealthy

environment is the principal business of the medical profession." Pretty much nails it.

Yeah.

So indirectly and probably without knowing the far right are actually protecting the

population by being so heavily against any kind of a universal healthcare system.

Yeah. My experience, the people who attend my lectures over the last 50 years, the people

with the superficial ideology that's called far right, they very often have contact with

reality and life. They're actually more pro-life than the so-called left who say they are pro-life.

I think it might be a fairly easy thing to overcome that verbal identification of ideology

right and left and get people to pay attention to what it is to be an organism. Organisms

are naturally tending towards altruism and empathy. That's a biological thing that so-called

right-wingers are not impaired at as people, only as ideologues. So if there's a way that

they can reattach themselves to the world, they've already got sort of a body commitment

to not being fascist.

Wow. That's amazing. So how do you reconcile that with their idea? Because most far right

people are very heavily pro-death penalty, pro-gun rights, pro-somebody walks on you

alone, you're allowed to shoot them kind of thing. Or are you saying that the people that

you think are more in contact with reality are even further right towards the libertarian/anarchist

side, that they don't even believe in government and terror and whatnot. They just want to

be left alone.

Yeah, the people that identify as libertarian are among the most gullible. I've known lots

of them and the ones that have studied it and make an ideology of it, things like death

penalty combined with libertarianism. I think there's an old-fashioned kind of conservative.

You know who Ron Unz is? Or Unz, U-N-Z?

Is that the unz.com? Yeah, unz reports or something?

Yeah. He has identified himself, he was a publisher of American Conservative and has

been identified as a right-wing extremist. But some of his publications are much more

progressive than things you see in Counterpunch, for example.

I think Whitney Webb started writing for the Unz Review not long ago, and she's somebody

that went deep on Epstein and all his connections. Speaking of Epstein, Bill Gates is, according

to the New York Times, Bill Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein many times despite his past.

So Jeffrey Epstein is this convicted pedophile, child trafficker, and then Bill Gates continues

to meet with him. What do you make of that, Ray?

The worship of power. Epstein flaunted his connections with power. He knew everyone powerful,

and that attracted Bill Gates, wanting to associate himself with power wherever it was.

I think the CIA has tried to infiltrate itself into every conceivable cultish movement. Probably

the pedophiles are being manipulated by the CIA as much as the religious groups and political

groups.

I was listening to Whitney Webb calling Maria Farmer, who had worked for Epstein on his

island and she wasn't allowed to leave. She said some ridiculous stuff, like she would

see five young girls per day visiting Epstein. But if you try to find out what Epstein actually

did, it's actually difficult. I don't know what he was charged with, but it's not even

close in the realm of what Maria Farmer is talking about. She knew Ghislaine Maxwell

and Epstein pretty well. Then she was talking about what happened to all these people, and

it just getting very dark pretty quickly.

But anyways, Whitney Webb said that Epstein was into eugenics too. So again, just another

point for all these eugenics crazy elite people.

I think Ghislaine Maxwell is pretty obviously an Israeli intelligence asset. She's either

like her father, like father, like daughter, I guess. I mean, I think it's pretty obvious

her job was probably to collect compromising information on all of the pedophiles that

were visiting the ranch. I wouldn't be surprised if they have a video on most of the powerful

people in the world right now doing something nefarious, and that's how they get what they

want from them.

But after Epstein was arrested, there was a little bit of news about the nature of the

photographs they found in his house and safe. But after he was killed, nothing more has

come out.

Do you think they'll ever reopen the investigation? Do you think people have forgotten the social

memories is way too short? And now everybody's attention is now on to the virus and nobody

cares about Epstein anymore.

Yeah, yeah. Events like that erase the immediate past and let us move on.

What do you make of Trump's connections with Epstein?

He didn't seem to be as close as Bill Gates or Bill Clinton. Clinton and the lawyer, Harvard

lawyer professor.

Dershowitz?

Dershowitz, yeah. They had many more contacts than Trump.

Dershowitz, isn't this the Harvard lawyer who wrote a couple of op-eds saying that torture

should be legal? Or am I thinking of somebody else?

What should be legal?

There was a famous Harvard lawyer who wrote a couple of op-eds.

Yeah, he did.

Stepping back a bit, just because I like to talk about it, but the Trilateral Commission

and this being, I think the thing is that Brzezinski wrote Between Two Ages and then

Rockefeller saw that book and then he created the Trilateral Commission. Do you see that

as, if people are trying to trace back where we're at today, do you see the Trilateral

Commission as something important to investigate?

Not especially. I think the Birch Society was pretty well investigating it. The people

on the far right of press were giving a good picture of what his plans were.

I think the only thing I'd like to pose this question to you, Ray, which is worse, the

possibility of getting a virus that could kill you, especially if you have comorbidities,

or have your life savings wiped out, your home foreclosed, your car repossessed, your

kid's college dreams being crushed, maybe that's okay, and living on welfare? What do

you think is worse to you?

I always would prefer the disease.

Because it's usually less severe, especially if you're not visiting a doctor, right?

Yeah, I don't believe the disease is especially harmful, so not much conflict between.

I know you've talked about it in multiple interviews, but can we talk about transmission

of disease? Is the transmission of viruses between people just kind of an inherent property

of human communication? What do you make of that? The idea of social distancing in general,

like if I go outside and I have coronavirus, I'm going to kill grandma. What do you make

of that?

The mechanism by which it reproduces itself, it goes in and activates the enzymes that

copy the RNA and make the proteins that form the capsule, and then fast numbers pour out

through the endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted. That mechanism is already making

retrovirus particles that, under a microscope and by chemical analysis, are structural,

close analogs of the various virus particles. They only began to be really studied at the

beginning of this century, the exosomes, microvesicles, and various names for them. But the serum

and the lymph are really full. Under an ordinary microscope, they're basically invisible dust

in the background, but when you look at that dust under a microscope, they are these highly

organized vesicles with a structured cytoplasm-like cover and RNA, DNA, enzymes, lipids, and so

on. The fact that maybe half of our DNA collection consists of things that structurally look

like retroviral copied DNA and that when we're under stress, we pour out large quantities

of these exosomes that are thought to be a communication between different tissues, like

an injured lung will send exosomes that are absorbed by bone marrow cells, which then

make particular kind of white blood cells that have the capacity to repair the lung.

So they're known to have communication property in the organism. They are abundantly present

in maternal milk and are taken up through the intestine wall as immune support for the

baby and they are known to be able to enter the gonads in a way that would make them candidates

for what Darwin called gemmules. He thought they accounted for the inheritance of acquired

properties. The developing organ influenced by the environment would accumulate its properties

and send them to the gonads for reproductive copying.

In bacteria, starting with the simplest organism, bacteria can make particles like this, which

they transmit through a tube to other bacteria that lack the resistance factor, for example,

for antibiotics. But bacteria have been using this before antibiotics were thought of. It's

a communication, a genetic interchange between species and individuals of the same species

or across very different bacterial types to share acquired information. Since we can use

it within the organism, I think individuals probably habitually share stuff like this.

For example, you can find the DNA from a woman's previous partners in her tissues. All of her

tissues can be penetrated by the DNA she has been exposed to through semen. I think that

since the gonads are known to be able to take up these exosomes, the semen will probably

be found to contain lots of these exosomes, which look like and are structured like viruses.

If bacteria can do it, I think it's probably a routine thing for other organisms. Their

existence hadn't been suspected by Western science until just about the beginning of

this century. Even though people were writing about the apparent cross-phylum transmission

of genes 50 or 60 years ago, it wasn't acceptable to talk about it. But now I think the way

viruses came into being, when I talked to my professors about it, they just didn't want

to talk about it because they have to evolve in organisms and what that means they didn't

want to consider. But since we now know that exosomes are repair material and cross individual

communication, at least in bacteria, probably it's involved in that adoption of DNA from

semen. It's probably something happening all the time that we take up exosomes. I think

when an animal is very sick, it's known that the exosomes participate in amplifying the

sickness instead of correcting the sickness. The serum from an old animal accelerates aging

of a young animal and young serum retards aging of an old animal. It's probably the

presence or absence of harmful exosomes that accounts for that property of serum. I think

it's reasonable that sometimes these exosomes of stressed individuals become toxic enough

that that would account for where viruses came from.

I have a question and actually just a restatement and a question. Do you think it's fair to

say that viruses are basically a very efficient way of horizontal gene transfer that will

be one of their primary purposes?

Of doing what?

Of viruses being one of their primary purposes in nature would be to enable horizontal gene

transfer across organisms.

Right. Within organisms that's established, but I think organisms other than bacteria

are doing it.

Then I guess my question which is related to the first one is, if their purpose is also

as a communication mechanism across organisms, would it make sense to say that let's say

if an organism is very stressed and producing a lot of these viruses, that would be a signal

to the organisms surrounding it that the environment is suboptimal so that those organisms can

mount a defensive response, so to speak?

Right, just like bacteria. When you're healthy, like 80% of the people who contract coronavirus

don't even notice it. I think they're potentially constructive assistance improving our immune

system.

Okay. I've seen a few fascinating articles. Many of them are from the '60s and '70s before

really the medical authorities clamped down and controlled the information fully. There

are some older studies showing that nurses working in specific wards at the hospital

tend to come down and sometimes even die with the exact same diseases of the people that

they're taking care of. Do you think that may be explainable by this communication mechanism?

If a nurse is taking care of only cancer patients, they emit something, whether it's a virus

or some other chemical messenger, that eventually makes the organism of that healthy person

also succumb. It's known that being around sick people is not a good thing, and conversely,

being around healthy young people is beneficial for health.

Yeah, that's been known since ancient China times.

So do you think viruses could be one of those mechanisms? Like a very sick person would

emit these viruses, and initially the nurse taking care of the person, her organism or

his organism would be sort of warned, but if the environment is suboptimal, eventually

that becomes pathological, being around these people who emit warning signals all the time.

Yeah, that's basically my interpretation and why I don't worry about this particular type

of respiratory infection.

Do you surround yourselves with healthy young people, Ray?

I don't know. I would if I did.

Do you still teach at the University of Oregon?

Oh no, not for many, many years.

Because you mentioned you were giving some free courses, and I was wondering, how did

the university allow you to provide a free course? That's socialism.

In that 1968 revolution of the students, they temporarily got student-initiated courses.

If you could get a professor in the department to authorize it, you could find your own teacher

to teach the course, and students that I knew invited me to teach courses in biology, psychology,

anthropology, nutrition, and even one in philosophy. That was permitted for about 15 years, I think.

And then they shut it down.

Any particular reason why you don't teach anymore?

Well, I used to regularly lecture in places like health food stores, would sponsor my

lectures, and I would line up a row down the coast so I could drive between sites. On one

trip, I had contacted someone about publishing my books, who was a distributor to the health

food industry, and they saw what I was saying about unsaturated fats. And on that trip,

all of my scheduled lectures were canceled without explanation. At the health food store

in San Diego, which had a regular deal with a church auditorium for their weekly lectures,

the guy who was in charge of the lectures was fired and unavailable when I got there,

and the people in charge didn't know that I had been scheduled. But all along the way,

there were these mysterious cancellations. So that was the last time I went on my lecture

trips.

Do you think at this point, academia has become so authoritarian, there's basically no point

bothering trying to do anything with them?

When someone went to the dean of the graduate school and wanted me to teach a course on

cell water, the dean said, "But there's no literature on it. You would just be making

it up."

One of my old professors recently got fired for trying to invite Duesberg for speaking

at Georgetown University here in DC. As soon as the dean found out, basically, that person,

even though he was a tenured professor, got kicked out because it was considered that

Duesberg is a quack and no respectable university would want to associate themselves with inviting

that person to even speak.

Not so much related to academia, but Ray, one of my favorite things reading from you

was when you were having the back and forth with Mary Enig, but it might have been somebody

she was working with. They were like, "The only PhD Ray has is in disinformation."

You replied something like, "Where did she learn about my PhD in misinformation? I never

tell anyone."

It cracks me up every time.

I have some questions about the microbiome, if you want to switch more on a health-related

topic.

Remind me, 5G is something I do want to touch on, but go ahead.

I was recently reading an article. It was in a popular press magazine, but basically,

it looks like the story with the microbiome is very similar to the story with the essential

quote-unquote fatty acids. Now, this article came out, which said that whoever told people

that the microbiome in people is obligate, that we really need it, as it turns out, there

is no evidence for that.

When the journalists started digging and interviewing other scientists, the people who were really

studying the issue said, "I don't know why medicine claims that having bacteria in your

colon is a good thing. Having a microbiome in nature is by far the exception rather than

the rule."

Back when many people were healthy, the small intestine was known to be sterile all the

way from the mouth to the cecum, was germ-free. Now, something like 80% or 90% have bacterial

living way up to the duodenum.

You agree with the fact that there's basically no evidence right now showing that even the

colon really needs bacteria. Yes, it will probably get colonized, but in terms of its

effects on health, we're being fear-mongered here that you have to have this bacteria,

otherwise we'll die, our immune system will collapse, etc. There is no evidence for that.

If you look at the literature, nothing exists.

Yeah, did you read Bogomolets? I don't know how you pronounce his name, but he was a follower

of Metchnikoff, and he said that aging is caused by these bacteria, that the shorter

the colon and the quicker the food goes through, so fewer bacteria grow the longer you live.

He gave examples of parrots. Food goes in and comes right out quickly.

So that may be behind the reason why some of the Hollywood elite are experimenting with

total intravenous nutrition as a way of retarding aging. I don't know if you've seen the

articles on that, too. They're starting to transfuse blood from young people, too, which

is probably the more sinister version of it, but they're apparently also looking at not

eating but just injecting themselves with this complete diet that's supposed to be healthy

for them.

Yeah, there's a lot of information on germ-free animals, and they are very healthy for a much

longer time than germ-ridden animals.

Do you think this theory that we need our microbiome and we have to feed it with all

of these pro- and prebiotics, do you think that's more of an example of institutional

stupidity or do you think there's something more sinister here at play that's trying to

keep us sick?

No, I think that's a good case for stupidity. For years, I followed the work of several

well-known biologists, and for decades, I couldn't decide whether they were evil or

just stupid. But then when they died following their own advice, I decided that they were

just stupid.

What is that expression, "Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity"?

Right, right.

You want to talk about 5G?

What is your take on the... I mean, I don't know this for sure, but it seems like 5G towers

are going up during this time. So is 5G something needed for the technocratic slave grid, or

what is your take on it?

Yeah, I think it makes the control messages faster and more powerful and unavoidable,

but at least with that stuff, we can put a screen on the wall between us and the tower

or on the roof and attach it to ground so that we have sort of a Faraday cage around

us and defend ourselves if we stay indoors. Otherwise, we'll have to get tinfoil hats

with a dragging wire.

You told me this a long time ago, but chicken wire can defend against the cell phone towers,

but then you have to get a finer mesh for something like 5G. Is that right?

Right.

Just because I'm sure we'll be asked, what do you think of the idea that 5G is causing

the symptoms of coronavirus?

Every little thing hurts. Everything that is stressing you, using up vitamin A and tending

to lower your blood sugar is making you more susceptible and tending towards an inflammatory

state and it's just that the virus adds to all of the other things you've been exposed

to stressing you. The virus is one more trigger for the shift to inflammation, but endotoxin

from intestinal bacteria is producing exactly the symptoms the virus does and similar to

high altitude brain and lung edema, all of those stressors when you aren't adapting properly.

High altitude, people who are hyperventilating at sea level, hyperventilation becomes more

dangerous at high altitude and the symptoms of hypothyroid hyperventilation overlap with

endotoxin and that overlaps with coronavirus symptoms and so on. All of the diseases end

up with the same cascade of inflammatory reactions and all of the defensive pro-energy anti-inflammatory

things, thyroid, vitamin D, progesterone, calcium, aspirin and losartan for example,

all of these are beneficial against aging, all of the infections, cancer, heart disease,

they're all working to support the system, all of the bad things are working to inflame

and deflate the system.

One thing I think we've kind of covered it, but I just want to beat the point into the

ground, but I think I have trouble and I know other people have trouble understanding the

power elite or whatever you want to call them, how they think about things and something

I did pick up from Jay Dyer who's been going through each of the globalist books. They

write books and they tell you what they want to do and he's just going through them and

reading them and something he said that stood out to me is the scientific priest class,

they think of themselves as like engineers of evolution and they think that because they

have this privileged place and these privileged bloodlines and things that they think they

should steer evolution in a certain direction and so their kind of dysgenic plan to basically

kill everybody or to make everybody really stupid, they see it as a good thing because

they have the ability to do that so they should do that.

Yeah their image of the elite happens to overlap with stupidity. If you look at the most influential

people in our culture, the meritocracy is somewhat of an idiot, idiot-cracy.

Well I have some quotes from John D. Rockefeller from, Ray have you ever heard of the book

Rockefeller Medicine Med by E. Richard Brown?

I don't think so.

It talks about how the AMA and the whole modern medical system was established by the Rockefellers,

like their specialization and things like that. But it has some choice quotes by John

D. and like God gave me money and he thus felt called upon to explain I believe the

power to make money is a gift from God and to be developed and to the best of our ability

for good of mankind I believe it is my duty to make money and still more money and to

use the money I make for the good of my fellow man according to the dictates of my conscience.

And of course we know that to him I guess that meant eugenics and the science of his

day to make the world a better place.

Yeah.

I have a question, do you think Ray, do you think most of these people, the evil ones

that are driven to harm the world, do you think they're driven by sort of like an internal

disturbed psyche because of serotonin, estrogen, etc. Or do you think there's some religious

reason behind it?

A lot of them seem to espouse or worship or practice these weird religious cults, even

though some of them are atheists, but many of them seem to be really religious and dedicated

to their cult.

Do you think there's a religion that specifically enables that or like an offshoot, like a perversion

of a specific religion that does that or do you think it's mostly some people got in a

position of power and decided that they should do it because they can do it?

I think a lot of it is what Wilhelm Reich explained as the effects of childhood harm

coming into the culture and being educated by parents, like Hitler's father was a sadistic

authoritarian.

The mothers and fathers both instill a kind of authoritarian stupidity, elitism, especially

in the elite, the children of the elite get a horrible dose of that kind of destructive

authoritarian upbringing.

So maybe they got damaged in childhood and then they grew up and found a religion that

justifies their behavior.

Right, right, whether it's Satanism or child abuse, it fits a distorted personality.

I've always wondered that.

Do you think these really sick people are shown something that they cannot give up or

is it just like basic primal things like sex slaves and other things and power and they

don't want to give that up because it just seems so – again their psyche is so hard

to grapple with of how insane they are.

Yeah, I think if you think of the organism as having only a certain range of behaviors,

the authoritarian system has its preferred ways of being stupid, violent and cruel and

self-centered.

It goes with a patterning of the endocrine system that makes the brain tend towards verbalism,

rationalism, mechanistic thinking rather than an open, empirical, exploratory attitude towards

everything.

I have a question in regards to that.

In one of your interviews you said that we have to begin and end with being an animal

into this world, right?

I don't know of any animal that behaves in this twisted and capable and is behaving

in this twisted and perverted way as a human.

Do you think that's coming from the fact that humans have a wider range of possible

behaviors compared to animals?

No, I think it's the exploitive culture taking form through language, how language

shapes the way you look at the world and yourself.

It closes off things right from when people start thinking, they start losing their animal

intelligence to the extent that they identify with those authoritarian elements of how the

cultures are set up.

Do you think animals are capable of similar behaviors like humans, sort of like being

atrocious to others?

Not to that extent.

They show damage by being fearful or aggressive, but nothing very close to human authoritarianism.

Like a vicious dog or a fearful dog, their brain can be restored to a great extent along

with their hormones.

So what is the human capacity or human faculty that allows humans to behave in an intentionally

evil way and often even planning these evil things decades ahead?

Is it our higher intelligence?

Yeah, the big cortex that can be so taken over by language and culture.

So basically with capacity for good, there is also capacity for evil.

So it's just the capacity and how you use it depends on your upbringing and the environment.

Yeah, the choice between culture and life.

Culture can be an extension of life and a tool for improving life, but so far cultures

have been heavy in the direction of control and reduction rather than expansion.

Ray, in six months when you're forced to buy the new iPhone and show the grocery person

a QR code that you don't have coronavirus so you can buy milk, what are you going to

do?

Leave, I think.

Do you think?

Where would you go?

Yeah, that won't catch on for a long time in small towns in Latin America.

In one of the articles you said that civilization's best chance of escaping the fascism is somewhere

in Western Latin America.

You didn't specify a country, but do you have one in mind?

It varies with the type of indigenous people that have influenced that region.

There are areas in Mexico where people are just extremely open and humanistic because

of the nature of the original culture.

They're completely overwhelming the sadistic Spanish-imposed culture.

I think there are probably many areas through Latin America where the indigenous population

has won the mind effectively.

In Mexico, it's just a cultural thing that the government and police are totally corrupt.

I didn't meet anybody that didn't know that.

In America, you have to convince somebody that that is the case.

The realism is everywhere in Mexico that no matter where you are, you know that people

have some basic sanity.

You have to be careful in the United States who you're talking to.

You see that, given how quickly things have changed, you don't see ... Do you think you

could even leave in maybe a year or two?

Do you think it will get that draconian, or how do you see it playing out?

You have to know the back roads.

That's good to know.

I have a question about 5G.

I'm sure I already know about Einstein's photoelectric effect.

That's actually what's used to justify the "safety" of most of these technologies.

They're saying, "Well, look, this is non-ionizing radiation."

At this point, even the National Institute of Health has come out with papers of its

own studies saying non-ionizing radiation is clearly carcinogenic.

There's also an effect correlation with the higher frequency.

Even though higher frequency penetrates less deeply into the body, it discharges more of

its energy, similar to the way the cosmic rays affect you differently, depending on

what altitude you're at.

Do you think the higher frequency is worse?

A lot of it functions as an antenna, like vitamin A and carotene function as an antenna

for blue light.

Riboflavin reacts with blue light, so that's toxic and very harmful to the extent that

it gets in your tissue.

The whole idea that only ionization is damaging, that's part of why the membrane theory and

random activity of enzymes, communication, and the cytoplasm as being in ordinary water

dissolved molecules.

If the water is organized and an organizing principle for coherence throughout the cell

and tissue, then that becomes an antenna for sound frequencies, all of the various frequencies

of electromagnetic oscillations.

That's part of the power behind the furious denial of structured water in cells.

It opens up this whole range of interaction with the environment that industry furiously

refuses.

So, the higher the frequency, I'm guessing because it's the shorter the wavelength,

the more opportunity for molecules in the body to act as an antenna to those frequencies?

Yes.

The radio waves are the least likely to interact, but when they get down to the wavelength of

your brain or your gonad, for example, those wavelengths are especially toxic to those

encapsulated organs because the capsule itself captures like an antenna.

That's very interesting and it's actually sort of confirmed by the studies that NIH

published because they saw different cancers in different organs depending on the frequency.

It wasn't a universal cancer effect, it was organ specific.

There's a lot of information on that, but it goes against the dogma that says it's

all random stuff inside the cell.

I was surprised to actually see that study being published by NIH.

I thought that these scientists would probably get fired.

I haven't checked up on them.

They came out last year, but they seem to still be employed.

I don't know why they published it.

I don't know what the meaning is of what they observe until it gets published.

Too late.

It's already on the street.

Something you said in another interview was about how when this all started, who was it?

The Iran people that were running Iran were the first people to get the virus.

I thought that was interesting.

I've only heard one or two other people even talk about that.

Can you repeat it?

Oh, yeah.

The parliament in Iran, several of them died very quickly.

It was centered on the political people in power exactly as German warfare ideally works.

Do you think a more virulent strain or something like that was released to them or is just

the ACE inhibiting properties enough to kill an unhealthy person?

No, I think they probably had a more effective strain for the Iran elite.

Is there anything to the idea that there isn't a central bank in Iran?

I think North Korea is the other place.

There has been a concentrated effort to invade these places to set up banks.

Yeah, the whole idea of an autonomous government just isn't acceptable.

It's a way out like college.

It was a way out for students to find a place where they could honestly talk to people and

learn.

If you have an autonomous country, they can do things and come up with new ways of living.

Just because I'm an economic idiot, but when a bank is in, they establish a central bank

somewhere and what are they, loaning money to the country and then they're in debt?

Is that how it works?

Yeah.

Everyone has to be in debt to be controllable and it has to be in dollars.

The countries that want to use gold or their own currency, like Libya, was getting away

from the dollar and creating their own currency and gold for exchange.

So they had to be murdered.

Speaking of currencies, not many people know, but even though this is already officially

admitted by the US government, but the reason Iraq was invaded, aside from the fact that

this whole thing with the weapon of mass destruction was a lie, is that Iraq was trying to set

up a separate oil exchange that would trade the oil, not in dollars, but in something

else.

The moment they announced that, within a week, they were invaded.

Similar to how MLK was killed the moment he made poverty the issue and not the race.

The empire is hoping that shaking down the world economy will delay the evasion of the

dollar by the China, Russia, Iran interactions.

That's the big threat to the dollar currently and it's the hope that that will be slowed

down enough that the empire can survive.

Okay.

Okay.

Thank you so much for everybody in the chat.

Thank you, Georgie.

Thank you, Ray.

How are we doing on time, Ray?

Helena says, "I am internally grateful to Dr. Peat, Danny, and Georgie for the wealth

of information you share to keep us informed with what is really going on in the health

system.

Thank you."

Primitive Initiative for $4.99 says, "Thank you, Ray, Danny, and Georgie for putting all

of this crucial information out there.

Let's hope the corrupt fall by their own hands.

Amen."

Primitive Initiative for another $9.99, just because.

Thank you, Primitive Initiative.

My sister and I send huge amounts of thanks.

Thank you, Janet.

Harry Burgos for $25.

Very informative and enlightening discussion per usual.

freedom and healing to my life.

God bless."

Thank you, Belove, for that.

Okay.

So, in click, we have 176 people listening at the moment, and I'm sure a lot more later.

Kind of in closing, Ray, I mean, what are your thoughts on the future?

Like, I know this whole chat has been kind of how grim things are, but what are your

thoughts going forward?

I think people are reaching a point where they're going to decide they have to choose

life and changing the system.

What do you see that looking like?

Oh, basically, you can't tell, but if people start interacting and actually realizing that

it's a desperate choice that has to be made, intelligence is the nature of life, and I

think intelligence will come to the surface in the process, and everyone who has knowledge

of possibilities is just there to support the process of making decisions, but without

knowing what it's going to look like.

I'm optimistic without having any idea of what's to come.

And Georgie, closing words?

In one of his interviews, Dr. Peat said that he would like to see nutrition raised to the

respect level of astrophysics.

I think that's actually starting to happen right now, mostly by coercion, simply because

people will be forced to start taking matters nutritionally into their own hands, simply

because the food chain will collapse, if you can even call it providing food or whatnot,

but that's the positive side that I'm seeing.

People start worrying more about nutrition and its quality and less about exactly what

kind of car they drive and what company they work for, if that company even exists in the

next few months.

I'll call it there, guys.

Thank you so much.

Ray, stay on the line.

We'll just keep you for a minute or two.

Georgie, thank you so much.

Ray, again, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Sincerely appreciate it.

Being flexible with the timing and things, it was a true pleasure to have you on again.

Thank you so much.

Thank you, everybody in the chat.

Thank you, everybody who donated.

I will forward those to Ray.

Ray, you got the donation last time, correct?

Right.

Thank you.

I just want to confirm.

Thank you, guys, everybody.

Sincerely appreciate it.

I have an amazing audience.

Please like this episode because YouTube will do absolutely nothing to promote it and it

will probably actively hide it.

Guys, thank you so much.

Again, amazing.

Very happy.

Take care, everyone.

Pretty good. 00:07:15.00 --> 00:07:20.480 So, we were just chatting about, you were talking about global warming or so-called

climate change and things.

That might be kind of an interesting place to start in talking about, I don't know, the

intersection between coronavirus, the elite, global climate, and like the quotes of like

the Club of Rome talking about how we needed to find a common enemy to unite humanity and

that the real enemy was man itself.

Yeah, China is just a convenient propaganda object to justify, for example, they say they'll

be testing new atomic bombs, more usable atomic bombs within a few months.

But that's been the very long-term plan of the Pentagon justifying the invention of planetary

warming through carbon dioxide.

Have to change the economy away from carbon energy to nuclear energy so they can have

a constant supply of nuclear fuel to make bombs as simply a way to focus the attention

of the world as long as they have nuclear bombs that are more and more usable.

They experience the sense of power that's recognized by everyone.

China is just the momentary focus of why they need the bombs.

But after China is no longer a threat or rules the world, they'll still have to hang on to

their nuclear bombs just for their police power, even if it's only within this continent.

They'll still have their nuclear deterrent.

Do you see this ending in a real terrible way, like a war between the US and China or

something like that?

No, Russia and China are now getting close militarily as well as economically.

So basically the US is lost on that basis.

They wouldn't have a chance in a nuclear war.

Putin told them that Russia won't allow another war to be fought on their territory.

They've had three great wars that ruined the country each time.

He said it won't happen again.

So they have demonstrated their weapons that can, at any invasion, they can eliminate the

source of the invasion, either topically or systemically.

So some people in the conspiracy sector think there's uniformity among these big empires,

but how much are they trying to do the same thing?

But you're saying they're radically opposed to each other.

But for example, the things that China has done are really similar to what the US is

doing right now in terms of controlling the citizenry.

But you're saying, are they just in a race to how fast they can get more control over

the population?

The US isn't very sympathetic with their concept.

China is very focused on public health and education, and the US is always behind on

public consciousness and education supported by good health.

They're doing things that have massively ruined the public's health, which drags down the

way they're performing intellectually and productively.

They see that China, continuing as things are with a more or less even playing field,

China is obviously imminently winning the game.

So they're trying to change the rules fast enough that they can get ahead.

According to Eric Schmidt's description of the situation, a very detailed discussion

of how artificial intelligence is to be used to preempt China's digitalization of the economy

of the world.

So why would the United States be stupidly destroying its own population, considering

that they need that population to be as productive and as healthy as possible, even though it

may be done without good intentions, just to make sure the slaves are healthy, so to

speak.

But it seems like that's not being done.

It's like it's the opposite.

The population is being absolutely decimated educationally and nutritionally and health-wise.

How does that help the empire?

Or is the empire basically saying, "Oh, we don't care about the population.

Our approach is we're just going to neutralize any competitive threat that comes through"?

Yeah, that thing of automation and artificial intelligence has been such a deep part of

them since the 1930s, that since then, they have considered public education as a drag

on the system.

It's just a waste of resources.

Yeah.

People were talking about it all through the '40s.

It was just a little over 50 years ago that it became a very open public policy that they

were set on peonizing the whole United States, taking policy choices that would reduce income

growth for nearly everyone in the country while concentrating it.

Reaganism was simply one stage of this process in peonization.

So here's another question.

I mean, with all this military power, all these nuclear weapons, all this technology,

if the empire really wanted to out-compete everybody else, why can't they just colonize

the moon or Mars?

There's this endless, infinite universe out there, and all these resources and energy

and equipment could have gone towards making the empire a galactic force or at least a

solar system force.

Instead, the efforts are focused here on attacking other people who are raising their head.

Yeah, the thought of having a world of peons is such an emotional part of it.

The ruling class hates the idea of competition from ordinary people.

So choices way back were meant to degrade as many people as possible by lowering the

quality of schooling at all levels and nutrition, having diets scaled economically.

I started that in the '30s, and in Los Angeles, I saw doctors are trained to do that.

Grains, pasta, and beans as the economy diet, and then seafood and fruit and dairy foods

for the privileged diet.

So would it be fair to say that a psychopath is always seeking out conflict with other

people even though that psychopath has the opportunity to colonize the solar system?

They're saying, "Nope, there's no people there.

There's nobody to enslave.

So we're going to focus our efforts here on Earth because there's other people we can

torment and peonize."

We're choosing that way because there's nothing out in the solar system.

Nelson Rockefeller and Franklin Roosevelt had agreed, the two party leaders, on the

post-war world.

They were to develop first Latin America as part of our economic system, build them up

as a consumer economy, and then Africa and Asia would come at later stages.

But a Marshall Plan for the world was the idea to get the whole world up to speed so

that capitalism could continue as a growing, productive system.

But the faction that took over with Truman, the Dulles faction, they were the elite haters

of the public, and South Americans were less than the public.

Have you heard the rumor that FDR was murdered?

I think actually you mentioned this once in your interviews, right?

Oh yeah.

The Roosevelt family was convinced of it, Stalin was convinced of it, and anyone who

knew what the Dulles, Alan Dulles, what he had been doing during the war was treason.

It came out that Stalin's spies told Roosevelt what Dulles had been doing, working for the

Nazi army, and Roosevelt said, "Oh, that isn't possible, that would be treason."

And it took a couple of weeks for the facts to come through his system, because it was

held up by the German Dulles intelligence apparatus.

It took a long time to ever reach anywhere in the United States, but meanwhile Roosevelt

had died.

Ray, do you think the different power elite factions, do you think they're on the same

page about installing killer austerity in every way imaginable?

For example, Webster Tarpley in his book, The Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, says

Soros is also associated with a series of projects designed to assault traditional moral

values such as championing of legalized narcotics to be made freely available, inevitably to

young people as well.

And you mentioned the food system and just the culture in general.

Do you think they're all generally on the same page about that?

Yeah, the CIA financing itself by selling drugs in the big cities in the US, that has

been documented over and over.

They were profiting in two ways, by destroying poor people in the US and financing their

illegal operations with drug money.

What was the name of the journalist that wrote about the crack epidemic being started by

the CIA and he was found with two bullet holes in his head and three independent inquiries

ruled that it was suicide?

Web something?

Yeah, sort of hard to shoot yourself twice in the head.

Did you hear about the death of China's ambassador to Israel?

No.

Oh no, when did that happen?

A couple of weeks ago.

China has been making big deals in technology with Israel and Pompeo visited Netanyahu trying

to get him to stop the deals with China, but then suddenly China's ambassador, who had

been the agent for building infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, he

died in his sleep at the age of 57, just about a month after taking the office.

It reminds me of the Iranian nuclear scientists who basically started mysteriously dying all

over the world while giving talks.

It happened maybe close to 10 years ago and then they found out it was Mossad agents using

fake British passports that were present at the same conferences.

This assassination really implies that the US is inside the Mossad because it was absolutely

against Israel's interests.

That's actually a pretty interesting point.

So it's okay.

Okay, so I've heard the opposite, that Mossad has infiltrated the CIA, but you're saying

it's the other way around?

Probably both.

They're the same agency.

It's just different branches across the world, right?

Yeah.

Well, I mean, there was somebody who said that you've never criticized Israel before.

What is your, and I know that's not true, but what is your general take on that situation?

That I've never criticized Israel?

It was an internet comment, so don't take it with too much weight.

No, I think it was in 1976, all of my Jewish friends, it seemed like most of my friends

from all through the late 50s and 60s seemed to be Jews, but suddenly the attitude of,

they were starting to confound Zionism with Jewishness, and suddenly if you criticized

Zionism, which I was doing constantly, they were calling you anti-Semitic.

From the mid 70s, my criticism of Zionism has been very steady.

So it turns out that internet commentator was wrong.

So I have a question related to that.

I mean, as I'm sure, Ray, you've noticed that if you try to seek out the truth and you hold

opinions that are not very popular, you're probably going to be a little bit more alone

than most other people.

Would you say that that's the case?

Just because you'll be so out there for many people, and even if they don't disagree with

you, they will think like, that's just too crazy for me to even consider, so I'm not

going to associate with that person.

Oh yeah.

Look at Gilbert Ling and his students.

As long as his graduate students supported the work they were doing, they couldn't get

jobs.

They were non-existent, and so those who wanted to continue in biology had to renounce him.

They just weren't doing that anymore.

So do you, in your social life, do you sometimes conceal your opinions because you don't want

to, I don't know, drive away your friends?

Or do you pretty much say what you mean, and if they leave, then so be it?

I've never been a big party attender, but I never went to a party before.

I probably didn't offend most of the people there by talking about what I was interested

in.

Well, Ray, sometimes I feel like we've had a conversation and I've said something totally

wrong, but you didn't necessarily immediately inject that I was wrong, and then I would

find out three months or four months later that I in fact was really wrong.

I took that as maybe, and you do this, maybe, and again, my perception of maybe to all people,

but Maslow has that quote where he says that, this is semi not related, but when he talks

about letting somebody go through their pain and not telling them not to feel that way,

so maybe that's a sign of respect that you don't just immediately correct somebody if

they don't think exactly like you do?

Oh, yeah.

For a long time I've thought that that's a necessary thing everywhere, especially on

any important political issue.

If you're in a movement, the Occupy Wall Street failed to do that.

They insisted that everyone had to have the same opinion and they just stopped existing.

If you have some things in common that you agree on, you have to respect the person for

having all of those right ideas and forget about their mistakes or omissions.

Before we launch off in a different direction, can you say what Zionism is and maybe why

you disagree with it?

Because that might be a new concept to some people listening to this.

Do you know about the protocols of the elders of Zion?

Those principles are being freshly stated over and over again.

It was an idea that was current at the end of the 19th century.

After Israel was founded, leading rabbis there have repeatedly restated exactly what they

have in mind, definitely not staying within the borders the UN, British Empire, and United

States gave them.

And then in the past few episodes and some of the other interviews you've done, you've

been pro-Trump in this situation.

And I know things are very complex, but one of the main things that some people say against

Trump is that he's in the pocket of Israel.

And so how do you unpack that situation?

The important thing is that from Truman down through Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, and Hillary

Clinton, the main thrust of US intention was destruction of Russia first and then China

second.

And Trump was an interruption of that long, almost 70-year pattern.

Good stuff.

Go ahead.

Yeah, I was going to say, so maybe it's more accurate to instead of Zionism to call it

Bencunism.

I mean, at this point I think it includes a very diverse set of people that maybe the

majority of them are associated with the Zionist movement, but I think at this point most of

the mega rich people are either inadvertently or sometimes even forced to be part of this

because their interests are aligned with the interests of the financial powers of the world.

Yeah.

He definitely is not against the ruling class, just different factions and processes within

it.

But I think the avoidance of nuclear annihilation, at least for eight years, has been a great

achievement.

So there's a little bit of nuance here of what power elite that staves off total destruction.

Yeah, the semi-conscious power elite that doesn't want the world to get incinerated.

And do you see, I'm sure this is very complex, but like the Rockefellers and their eugenics

kind of killer austerity plan, is that different from the Rothschilds' Third Temple Zionism

plan?

Or do they have compatibilities and incompatibilities?

Yeah, I think they're compatible.

But were the Rockefellers necessarily interested in Israel the way the Rothschilds are?

No, not that I know of.

Either way, almost everyone ends up as disposable property.

At what point do you think the old school, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, sort of established

powers merged with the Zionist powers to create this global elite?

Because I think you said in some of your interviews that it used to be those old, white, rich

people, and then I guess sometime around the early 20th century started getting shifted

heavily towards Zionism.

But at this point, they seem merged, wouldn't you say?

Yeah.

We can move on after this, but Rupert Murdoch being an agent of the Rothschilds and buying

up all the media, do you think that was a big part of, I don't know, obviously that

was key in controlling the opinions and thoughts of a lot of people that media take over?

Oh yeah.

The New York Times, too, is in harmony with Murdoch's.

This is pretty related, but I think this was a message to Jahed.

You said, "The reason I talk more about biology than politics is that various radical

movements generally have inflexibilities that keep them apart."

And so that made me think of our current situation, like coronavirus is dying down and then immediately

we have this death in Minnesota and that is propagated all over the media.

When this kind of thing happens, not to dissect this specific event, but when this kind of

thing happens, what is your thought process?

Is it a conditioning type thing to move us in a certain direction?

Accidents, personal, stupid murders will be taken advantage of to excite racial hostility,

but I think there are enough accidental racist events happening that it's just a matter of

how the media presents them and who is there to either try to point out what should be

done that you should immediately start fixing police forces rather than making it a matter

of racial identity primarily and then postponing actual changes.

I have a question about that.

We said a few times that the rich have always used these racial tensions as an instrument

to keep the public's attention away from the really pressing issues and forcing the

poor to fight over crumbs while they're stealing everything.

But don't you think it's a little bit dangerous for them to be playing that game?

One of these days, one of those racial incidents can lead to a revolution and in a revolution,

everything gets destroyed, including the masters that are thinking they're in control.

Why would somebody continuously use that dangerous fire that they set up in the living room while

they're sitting in the bedroom thinking they're safe, but at some point might consume the

entire house?

They have atom bombs backing them up.

They've used Israel to train the police in military tactics so that they have all of

the non-nuclear military weapons that they can use.

If that fails to hold down a revolution and a whole part of the state decides to secede

and become democratic, then they have the tactical nuclear weapons that can be used

for crowd control.

We've talked about this before.

That's called the Samsonite plan or something?

The Samson plan is Israel's plan, basically.

At some point, Israel feels like they're starting to get overwhelmed by their enemies.

They're just going to launch their 400-plus, I don't know how many nuclear warheads.

I think they even have a count that the US Department of Defense secretary, I think it

was Roosevelt, who actually gave it away.

Let's say about 400 nuclear warheads.

Apparently, they're all pointed to major capitals and cities and economic centers of the world

that these rockets can reach.

Basically, Israel has said, "You will defend us," by you meaning the world community.

If Israel is about to disappear from the map, we'll make sure that the world will disappear

as well by nuking everything.

In the background, for most of the Cold War, they had their doomsday weapon or doomsday

system.

It was a nuclear bomb surrounded by tons and tons of plutonium to create a radiation cloud

that would end the world.

People like the famous conservative, Buckley, was

making the explicit argument that people should prefer to die rather than let the Soviet Union

govern the world or even survive.

He said that God will sort us out if we're all dead.

We win anyway, so better red than dead.

That was put into the concrete doomsday system.

I just want to give an example to the people.

I've talked to people about potentially the U.S. government using any kind of weapon that

they deem necessary to quell dissent.

Most of our friends are saying, "You're insane.

The U.S. government will never do that."

But apparently they already did.

There was an incident in the mid-1980s in Philadelphia where the police bombed an entire

block because there was one house that was housing this black militant group called MOVE.

Yeah, a helicopter dropped bombs on the roof and burned the building up and killed everyone.

Same idea as in Waco.

A tank with flamethrowers and sharpshooters were killing people trying to escape, so they

intentionally burned the dissident Christians.

Even though they were, I think, mostly white, they were totally dissenting, so they were

fit to be murdered in mass.

And, Ray, I think on the last, maybe the last episode, you talked about how, was it the

FBI or the CIA that has infiltrated like every fringe movement?

And of course, like a historical example of that is COINTELPRO.

Expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize.

And that was like American Indian groups, Black Panther groups, and anti-Vietnam War

groups.

Yeah.

Even more moderate groups are controlled.

The whole New Left was a creation of the intelligence organizations.

The Congress for Cultural Freedom was strictly CIA, but they created the whole idea of a

New Left organization using supposedly progressive leftists.

You know, the Trotsky movement, after Trotsky failed to take over Russia, he started working

with the Nazis and the FBI and US intelligence organizations to create a takeover movement

in Russia from within, which is standard policy.

They undoubtedly have it in China and Russia now, doing everything they can.

What Georgie, I'd want to harp on as much as possible of people not believing how bad

their government intelligence agencies could possibly be.

You know, like Ray, we talked about Project Northwoods, which was kind of the mock bombing

of a plane or sending a plane into, oh my God, I'm screwing this up, sending a plane

into Cuba with like fake people on it.

But also the CIA's strategy of tension during Operation Gladio.

And one of the operatives says, you were supposed to attack civilians, women, children, innocent

people outside the political arena for one simple reason, to force Italian public to

turn to the state to ask for greater security.

And so people not knowing this stuff, that's just part of what they're doing.

They're kind of indoctrinating people with these things that we're talking about that

are historical fact being so-called conspiracy theory.

I doubt that most Americans have paid any attention to the news that Syrian wheat crops

across the country are being firebombed by US helicopters, which is even during war,

it's a war crime, but it's a crime against humanity.

It's such a trivial thing.

I haven't seen much talk about it.

I have a question.

I mean, it's related, but it's more general than that.

Do you think that if evil triumphs and it basically has its way, do you think that evil

is stable as a structure?

Do you think at some point it will simply collapse because that's just not how nature

works and it's almost like against physical laws?

Or do you think it will last indefinitely if it achieves complete control?

Yeah, they always need the abject obedience in sufficient quantity to let them have servants

and murderers, assassins, and so on.

And at some point that dwindles, they get weakened by their use and their expendability

makes them, I think, unsustainable.

Do you think that that may be one reason behind the collapse of most empires?

Because they all seem to follow a pretty similar script.

There is a peak, right?

And there is this long decline through which, of course, there is increase in authoritarianism,

police state, et cetera, et cetera.

And eventually there is this rapid collapse.

But this idea of evil triumphed and then it collapsed because it triumphed, that seems

to be a repeating theme across history.

Yeah, they keep increasing their power.

The use of power is mainly to increase the power.

And when you keep increasing the power, like the concentration of wealth, just the concentration

of wealth is pretty soon going to mean that Amazon owns everything and everyone else is

expendable.

So you'll have one corporation and what will they do to increase their power?

The board of directors is going to start fighting for who has the most power.

I see.

Ray, I quoted, you responded to somebody in email and you said, "No, a person is never

again the same after reacting to an aluminum adjuvant.

The official figures of the US government show clearly that the epidemic of chronic

diseases began with the massive increase of vaccination in 1989."

And that created quite a...

I don't go on Facebook very often, but I posted that on there and it riled a lot of people

up.

So do you want to offer more information or context about that?

Because this is a very real thing that's probably in the works or it has already been worked

out and is probably coming pretty soon.

What do you think people need to know about rolling up their sleeve and getting a vaccine

from Gates et al.?

The size of a baby's brain, especially in relation to its body length at birth, has

been growing from early 20th century steadily down to the 1970s.

In some countries, it has actually in the 1980s begun shrinking and I think that's a

pretty good worldwide indicator of the state of well-being and of deterioration.

Are you familiar with the Flynn effect, which is the parallel increase in IQ all the way

up until the mid-1970s and after that it's been basically in decline and there aren't

even any trials, it's just declined?

Do you know of Ernest Stern's study of the SAT scores?

Yes, I've seen that and I've also seen the sperm counts and testosterone levels in males

have been precipitously declining since the 70s and they're matching perfectly that

declining curve in IQ as well.

Brain size in relation to body and IQ and probably several other indicators of general

well-being have all stopped increasing and begun declining.

I think you can see it even in body shape and facial shape.

Some people pointed out, Ray, that you, I mean my limited experience of reading your

stuff like some people have said and I agreed that I've never heard you say like a person

is never again the same and so is there something specifically really harmful about the aluminum?

What is it about the aluminum adjuvant?

No, anything you do, you're always in process.

Heraclitus didn't miss anything.

There is nothing that is ever constant and so if you ate chocolate rather than strawberry

ice cream, you're never going to be the same again.

That's what I thought.

It was like shifting a trajectory of a person's life in just a different direction.

Yeah, yeah and there are some things that shift the trajectory more seriously and more

downward.

Radiation and stuff injected into your muscles or brain are especially harmful.

The radiation is equivalent because it affects things at the deepest levels the same way

injected materials do or inhaled or swallowed nanoparticles that go everywhere in the body

which are just sitting there ready to make genes out of the RNA ready to translate it

into not only DNA to make the spike protein to create an inflammatory reaction that will

lead to immunity but DNA that can be incorporated into our genes so that our offspring will

continue making that spike protein and if we don't make enough of it to kill the person

within the year before they start mass producing the vaccine, a very large portion of the volunteer

subjects for this vaccine have had serious reactions.

They call it a grade three serious reaction that might involve hospitalization.

No one died so they went on but the incorporation of RNA will undoubtedly have effects that

are going to be at least somewhat harmful, maybe progressively harmful all the way to

killing the person.

In terms of transgenerational effects, I know you've mentioned this before related to

the vaccines but which generation do you think would have it worst?

Would it be like third, fourth, fifth or would it be even further down the line?

It seems like the first generation that gets it gets harm but maybe it'll survive.

Then the second generation it may get skipped but the third one seems to be really where

the bomb explodes.

I think it depends on what the individual confronts in each generation.

The number of genes specifying making a human being in our genome is somewhere around one

to two percent of our DNA and around half of our DNA specifies retroviruses and each

of those retroviruses is recognizable because it has a reverse transcriptase.

These are probably when we're under stress, these are expressed to different degrees.

When we're well fed and happy, we can take in something like the spike protein RNA, pack

it away as a potential virus but keep it out of the way.

Transgenic or epigenetic effects are under control but anything that creates a great

problem, our system opens up this vast library of genetic material, shakes out some stuff,

produces exosomes from it which resemble viruses.

We're constantly to the degree that we're under stress.

Our cells are manufacturing exosomes just about the same size and structure of the coronaviruses

and other viruses and these are used to adapt to whatever it is that's bothering us, aging

or infection, poisoning, whatever that shakes up the organism arouses some degree of this

library of reference DNA material and adding one bit to it might not come out for 20 generations

but it's still idiotic to put the most toxic protein, the spike protein, to put the RNA

specifying that in our library of resources.

Speaking of messing up with our DNA and transgenerational effects, people ask you multiple times about

your opinion on GMO crops and I think you usually said that something along the lines

of that, these artificial genes that are there could be highly allergenic but I haven't seen

you say much in terms of whether this could have a transgenerational effect.

Do you think it may?

Oh sure.

Everything has a transgenerational effect.

Are you familiar with the Epicyte gene that Monsanto patented?

It's called EPICYT Epicyte gene.

I don't know.

I haven't heard of it.

So apparently this is, I mean, it can be Googled but it is an artificially created gene for

corn that specifically makes human males sterile.

Now I have no idea why Monsanto would be interested in such a gene unless they really had an intention

of using it but apparently there are genes in the plants that can actually cause direct

sterility effects and no vaccine is needed.

So I've been thinking lately about how all of these efforts to conceal the labeling of

the food in the United States and even in the entire Western world to prevent people

from knowing whether they're eating genetically modified food or not.

So if the powers that be want to do population control, it seems like they can do it through

food as well.

Yes.

The everything in a vaccine practically is adequate to create allergies in a young person

receiving it.

And if you include the nucleic acid as this new vaccine is doing, well, the old vaccines

all have nucleic acids in them as dirt, egg or other animal tissue or embryo tissue that

is used to grow the viruses for the vaccine.

That always leaks proteins and nucleic acids from what they grow it in.

So those are among the things that people are being made allergic to by injecting it

into them.

That's how you create an experimental allergy in animals and no one denies that it is in

the composition of genes and so accounting for the 25 fold increase in young people's

allergies.

And now that they're acknowledging that they're putting a nucleic acid in everyone who receives

the vaccine is going to have to be labeled genetically modified organism.

Speaking of protection from vaccines, I'm sure you've seen that most of the adjuvants

that are in there, they target the endotoxin receptor TLR4 or one of the TLRs.

So would it be pertinent to administer something if somebody, let's say somebody doesn't have

a choice, is forced to be vaccinated, maybe they're in the military or work in the healthcare

industry.

Do you think that blocking that receptor before getting that vaccine would confer some protective

effects if the endotoxin?

Everything anti-inflammatory that you do is going to tend to inhibit that.

Everything you do that is stressful is going to sensitize it and that's happening with

any vaccine.

The inflammatory system arranged around the endotoxin inflammation system, everything

you do risks activating that and that activates histamine, serotonin, and so on.

Everything that's involved in the coronavirus disease, so-called, the real disease is just

a very standardized stress disease.

That's why it overlaps so perfectly with sepsis or high altitude pulmonary edema, ARDS caused

by trauma, everything that tends to kill you tends to create the same condition.

Some people react badly to the coronavirus where 70% or so don't notice they have anything

worse than maybe a sniffle.

But there have been eight or ten studies that looked at the outcome of people who had been

given the influenza shots and the huge campaign in Italy and the US last year to push influenza

vaccine on old people.

According to the results of these several studies, people who were vaccinated against

influenza, according to their arguments, had somewhat less cases of influenza, maybe 45%

protection, but they were as much as five or six times as likely to have other respiratory

infection.

So, just looking at those figures, you would say that the great vaccination campaign of

old people, total of approaching 170 million in the US, I don't know how many in Italy,

if you doubled or tripled or quadrupled the number of non-influenza respiratory diseases,

you would expect to have a much higher percentage of coronavirus infections, which is what we

did see.

So in principle, just taking a hefty dosage of aspirin about an hour before a forced vaccine

would be a decent attempt to protect yourself?

Yeah, very good, because all of these things, angiotensin activates, among other things,

the prostaglandins.

And if you stop the prostaglandin storm, you reduce all of the cytokine storm.

But aspirin is just one of the protective things.

The blockers of angiotensin itself, angiotensin receptor blockers, stop at its source, the

cytokine storm, inflammatory storm.

And you might have heard that in Italy, one place, the mortality of men was four times,

well, 82% of the deaths were men, 18% women.

But one big study across the country found between three and four times as many men as

women dying.

And the only premenopausal women in more than 1,000 cases who died were radically abnormal

and hormonal, other extreme metabolic problems.

And several studies have documented in the US, it's maybe two and a half times as many

dead men as women.

But probably in the US, more women are supplementing estrogen.

And estrogen, well, it's reciprocal, estrogen increases angiotensin and angiotensin activates

aromatase.

And so women, especially after menopause, if they're taking extra estrogen, are equivalent

to having lower progesterone.

Even in old age, men have much lower progesterone than women, but their estrogen, an old man's

estrogen is often the same as an old woman's.

It's the progesterone that's extremely different.

The other big natural difference that shows up in the figures is that high altitude mortality

is about three to four fold lower in Bolivia, western China around Tibet, and other South

American countries, and looking at the high plateau states of Mexico, it was around three

times as high in the low altitude states as in the central plateau states.

And the only hormone difference that is extreme at very high altitude is progesterone, which

increases adaptively and protectively.

When you're able to adapt, you keep your carbon dioxide very high, and that goes with allopregnanolone

and progesterone metabolites being elevated.

To shift gears a little bit, I forget what article it was, but it was a James W. Prescott

article, it's Body Pleasure and the Origins of Violence in 1975.

And just a snippet from that, it's, "And the greatest threat comes from the nations which

have most depriving environments for their children, which are most repressive of sexual

affection and female sexuality."

So that makes sense to me, but I'm also interested in kind of the things we've talked about before,

kind of the sexualization of the culture and how that's kind of used as a weapon.

And so where is the healthy middle ground between those two things?

Between middle ground, between which things?

Do you remember it?

It's the James W. Prescott article, it's called Body Pleasure and the Origins of Violence.

And then the only thing I didn't read off is in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, like

a 1946 edition, he said, "As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom

tends to compensatingly increase."

And so that, I mean, just in my limited view, that kind of seems like what we're going through

now, like just these ever growing series of sexual revolutions as our normal freedoms

diminish over time.

And so, I don't know, maybe just your general thoughts of sexualization being used as a

type of weapon against people.

Prescott was a Reichian, and I would agree with the Reich that sexual freedom has been

a fraud and a distortion of sexuality rather than a liberation.

A deviancy, I would call it.

The what?

I would call it sexual deviancy instead of sexual freedom, wouldn't you?

Yeah, yeah.

The weirdness has been amplified and the actual free expression.

The CIA, with Gloria Steinem, for example, as a CIA operative, creating a new view of

feminism rather than erotic free feminism.

It was industrial-grade power feminism.

And then you trace that back to Kinsey, and apparently he was supported by the Rockefellers

and on the front page, or the cover of Time magazine, the CIA mouthpiece.

Yeah, yeah.

And you don't, do you think his science was very good?

Yeah, I don't think science was really science.

And the other kind of tag-along question to this is, in your email wiki, you said that

high estrogen does sometimes cause insatiable sexual interest, partly because it increases

adrenal androgens and partly by inhibiting satisfying orgasms.

And so I know in my experience, kind of my libido has fluctuated.

Sometimes I'll think my libido is great or something, and then I'll take something that's

obviously lowering stress and it will decrease.

And in talking to people, that seems like sometimes a person will be disturbed because

they'll perceive their libido as to be like awesome.

But sometimes I suspect maybe it's the stress driving the libido.

So is that something, can you clarify that statement or flush it out a little bit?

Yeah, Wilhelm Reich called it the genitalization, the localization of the orgasm and losing

the whole organism's function of the orgasm.

He saw the real orgasm as a cosmic thing in which your whole view of your partner and

the universe is undergoing a change so that both of your personalities and position in

the world change.

The orgasm is a discovery rather than a sneeze in the loins.

So basically sex is an art, is a form of art?

I guess.

What do you make of sexual obsession?

There are movements online from no-fap to no masturbation, anti-porn.

So people are waking up to the, didn't Israel put porn in Palestine on the television or

something to like, it's obviously, why is porn free on computers and stuff?

Even when I was born in 1985, seeing a pornographic image was such a rarity even in my youth,

but now it's just like everywhere.

And so if somebody felt like they were really into that, what would be some things that

they could do to detach, do you think?

I think a good place to start would be to read some of Wilhelm Reich's writings.

He saw it as a very important political question that made him an anti-Nazi.

Well if somebody's physiology was, so again I'd be curious on your opinion about this,

but maybe like the low energy hypothyroid state, like the, I'm not trying to moralize

masturbation or anything, but if somebody is attracted to that, maybe that's like a

low energy activity and kind of an exciting thing to do when you're in such a low energy

state.

Does that make sense at all?

Oh sure.

It can be relaxing and break stress.

Exactly, like as an anti, it's like something a person can do similar to going buying alcohol

or cigarettes, like there's a limited amount of things in the culture a person can do to

try to dampen the stress response and that's one of the things.

Yeah.

Little kids often do it just to go to sleep, having fantasies and rubbing themselves and

then going to sleep.

It helps to relax.

Yeah I wanted to say so, I mean because Danny mentioned that these movements to like try

to abstain from like from consuming pornographic material online, I was thinking of a similar

but slightly divergent line.

Like this is a way of self-medication of lowering cortisol similar to what an alcoholic would

do or a drug addict would do.

Maybe better to sort of try to search for the reasons why we're drawn to this excessive

sexuality all the time and sort of try to remove the reasons instead of trying to abstain

because I think the abstaining from one of the few things that brings relief, that can

itself also be pathological, right?

Oh sure.

Yeah.

The obsessive trying to change your behavior as part of an obsessive attitude.

I'm sure you've seen these programs, the so-called abstinence education which the Bush presidency

heralded and tried to impose on every school in the country.

I mean they failed spectacularly and at the time they said, "Oh it's because the American

youth is so undisciplined."

But there's probably a physiological reason behind it.

Basically these people are doing these things because they feel a relief.

So it's really counterproductive to go and tell them, "No, you shouldn't be abstaining.

You shouldn't be doing these things because it's immoral."

It usually has a – it kind of like backfires.

The public sometimes says, "You know what?

I'm going to do this and I'm going to do more simply because the authority is telling

me don't do it."

Yeah, but the sense of a neurotic self is a very powerful barrier against accepting

imposition of duty and authority.

Just preserving that little private corner can save a person from whatever monstrous

situation they're in.

Do you see sexuality as a liberating force in nature?

Because the reason I'm asking this is because if you look at throughout history, every authoritarian

society tried to brutally control sexuality.

To this day, there are cultures out there that would kill you if you break certain sexual

norms.

Is it because sexuality is such a powerful force that it can quickly undermine the powers

that be if it's left uncontrolled?

Oh yeah.

The authorities on why circumcision is so important recognized that it was to give an

obedient, fearful attitude towards sex so that they recognized that you could be cut

any time.

The political implications of sexuality, all the way from circumcision to Wilhelm Reich's

politics, it's really worth investigating and thinking about how the personality goes

through energy cycles.

The energy cycles are cycles of consciousness and you're constantly inventing and discovering

new things every time you have a satisfactory full cycle.

And Ray, part of the function of estrogen, if it is related to an insatiable interest

in sex, is that like a signal that the environment is bad and that the organism should try to

reproduce as fast as possible?

Is that somewhat related?

Oh yeah.

The worse the situation is, like in the spring when there's a drought underway, grass like

wheat will rush to come to a head and produce a seed.

Maybe only a few little ones, but it will manage to survive the cycle by accelerating

everything.

The early puberty in girls in extremely stressed societies, nine or ten years old, while in

traditional, calm, well-fed societies, especially with enough saturated fats like butter or

coconut oil, as in parts of India, puberty would normally be around 17 or 18 years old

and the whole organism would have time to mature more thoroughly.

In terms of healthy sexuality, would you say that it's better to have a robust sexual arousal

response when stimulated, but not really having much of a libido response without stimulation

versus this current craziness of somehow people have convinced themselves that having a high

libido all the time, whether you're surrounded by a stimulating event or not, they don't

care about this.

Now the culture is saying being hypersexual is good, but to me it seems that being hypersexual

is good only if the right stimulus is there.

If you're hypersexual all the time, then something's wrong, right?

Yeah, it's irrational if you're excited by a shoe or a toad or something else.

You wouldn't be very popular among common sexologists.

They'll say, "Don't shame people's kinks, Ray.

Some people like shoes."

Switching gears a little bit, finasteride, Ray, I know we've talked about this in the

past and in the quote I probably have sent to hundreds of people, I think you said in

2014, it was just a reply to somebody asking you what they should do having taken finasteride

and you said, "I think it probably started a chronic malfunction of your liver and intestine.

A simple diet is probably good, small amounts of thyroid pregnenolone."

Can we just kind of flush out the details of, one, my first question being like, if

a person has to take finasteride, there's already a problem.

And then two, how more difficult is the person's situation after they've taken the finasteride

in your estimation?

Well, first, no one has to take it.

It's an irrational decision and it probably means you're already abjectly obedient to

authority.

It's such an unfounded, basically an insane decision.

And any information that you get is going to make a thoughtful person fear it.

And it's a very powerful intervention in your steroid chemistry, which especially affects

your brain.

The brain is the biggest steroidogenic organ, probably next to the skin.

But it's changing your chemistry and to get over it, you're going to have to push the

system artificially, at least as hard in the opposite direction to try to bring it back

into a functional state.

So I want to, that's good stuff.

I want to talk more about that.

When it does regrow hair, what do you think it's doing?

Somehow shaking up the system, like creating an early false puberty, you can bring some

parts of the system into function in isolation.

And then do you think we know all the effects of what it is?

Do you buy that it's just a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor or do you think it's doing a lot

of other things?

Oh, not really other things.

But these 5-reductase, both alpha and beta reductases, the steroids are central to well-being,

progress of consciousness, the orgasm function itself, brain development at its foundation.

I'm sure you'll like this.

There was a study that I found recently which showed that even in snails, if you give them

a finasteride or any other 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and they confirm that it's specific

to the 5-alpha reductase, the snails no longer coil.

So it completely disrupts their morphogenetic field and this effect persists for several

generations.

So apparently dihydrotestosterone or allopregnanolone, which they didn't test which one of the

two because the finasteride inhibits just the enzyme that produces both of them, but

apparently one of these hormones is extremely important for the morphogenesis of even snails.

We can only imagine what inhibiting this enzyme does to the brain and to the human morphogenesis

field.

Yeah, the coiling of the brain is much more complex than the snails coiling.

Georgie touched on it a few episodes ago, but he suspected that when you said your liver

and intestine, that dihydrotestosterone was important for intestinal function.

Is that what you were thinking when you wrote this do you think?

No, I just think of that category progesterone, dihydrotestosterone, all of the stabilizing

steroids as essential to holding our organism in its shape and determining its future shape,

the way it coils and uncoils.

Specific to the digestion, apparently the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, the whole family

is important for the synthesis of bile acids, which are steroid-like molecules.

And if you inhibit the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, you won't be producing the bile acids, which

are crucial, obviously, for digestion.

And another thing I found out is that also the 5-alpha-reductase family is responsible

for turning cortisol into its reduced version, which is a lot less potent and actually in

some cases acts as an antagonist on the cortisol receptor.

So it looks like it's a fairly systemic protective function that these enzymes have

that doesn't even have to do much with sexuality.

It's more like metabolism and digestion and stress.

Yeah, that's why I always think of Heraclitus in connection to any seemingly simple biological

issue.

Nothing is simple, everything goes on forever and changes.

One last thing on this and then we can move on if Georgie doesn't have any additional

questions, but there's a huge culture around post-finasteride users and a lot of them will

say things like, "We need to find a cure."

And so what is your thought on that?

I've often suspected that...

I'm involved.

Well, the idea that you've taken finasteride, it's harmed you and then...

Hello?

Yes, can you hear me?

Can you hear me, Georgie?

Can you hear me?

Yeah.

Yeah, we can hear you now.

I'll just rephrase the question.

The idea of the needing to find a cure, what is your point of view on that specifically?

Because if you say it's very complicated and it started with your development and everything

in your life, I think that just isn't acceptable to a lot of people.

The association with the crease in the earlobe and the altered cholesterol metabolism and

everything, it says you've got to seriously back up and not look for a cure in the medical

sense, but to back up and as radically redo your life as possible.

Such things as, for example, going to a high altitude for six weeks at a time and eating

a totally different diet, making sure that your calcium intake is very, very high compared

to your phosphate intake.

The phosphate, for example, excess activates your parathyroid hormone, aldosterone, angiotensin,

everything that destroys hair growth.

Phosphate excess is very crucial for promoting.

So doing everything, high altitude will increase the balance of progesterone and help to get

the parathyroid hormone and aldosterone and angiotensin under control, but you have to

think of it at that very fundamental level of getting your energy system revved up and

turning off those toxic processes.

The parathyroid hormone in itself is enough to knock out the hair follicle.

Do you think, what is the extent of the damage to the vascular system when a person starts

losing hair?

Like, how much of it is stopping the processes causing the hair loss and how much of it is

attempting to reverse the damage that's already been done?

I think the things they do are seldom helpful.

Getting your spontaneous energy production high so that you're producing and retaining

lots of carbon dioxide, energizing and renewing the follicle so that it selects and retains

from your blood supply the trace minerals that it needs.

High energy is needed for that and the high energy is expressed through the balance of

carbon dioxide and keeping calcium out of the cells by keeping your parathyroid hormone

low, keeping aldosterone low by doing everything anti-inflammatory.

Just one other question.

You probably already answered it, but when somebody takes spironolactone or progesterone

or ciproterone acetate, what do you see?

You just mentioned a battery of different ways that it could improve things, but do

you see progesterone heating or increasing the temperature of the brain or is there a

primary mechanism or something you see as it doing to restore hair growth?

Progesterone is very closely connected to maintaining oxidative metabolism and higher

body temperature at rest.

But could you, like an area of balding scalp, is that proportionally colder over a longer

period of time or is that too reductionist?

Is what?

Evolving over time?

Like, is the balding area of scalp proportionally colder over a longer period of time or is

that a little...

Oh, that's because it's quiet relative to the other parts of the brain.

It's your thought process.

It's stabilized, but still at a good high temperature.

You can't think and plan if your frontal lobes are cool.

It's just that it has to be cooler than all the rest of your brain and body.

And progesterone is part of maintaining that coolness by keeping the activity focused rather

than attending in the direction of excitotoxicity and inflammation.

It quiets it so that it can think appropriately, but it does that against the background of

high energy, high temperature, high carbon dioxide content.

So I could not be understanding, but are you saying like a desynchronization of the brain?

I know you've said the frontal lobes are supposed to be cooler and they act like a dissipating

heat structure, if I remember correctly, and then the inner parts of the brain are the

hottest.

And am I following at all?

Yeah.

The carelessness of the front part of the brain is just part of the fact that it's very

hot, but by being uninsulated relatively, it can be cooler than the inside.

So one of the functions of the progesterone is to stabilize it so that it doesn't produce

heat needlessly, but also to keep the temperature up so that the energy supply is there.

The balance of carbon dioxide and lactic acid keep keeping the blocking hormones like parathyroid

hormone low.

And then when the tissue gets colder or the brain gets colder, what would be directly

behind the frontal lobes?

Is that the part that is directly affected?

And then the tissue, it gets cooler, the protective steroids drop, as you said, the parathyroid

hormone prolactin rises, and then that increases the activation and mobilization of mast cells.

Is that right at all?

The whole organs, any cell, when it's happy and successful and has done its work properly,

it maintains high energy, but quiescence.

And the frontal lobe of the brain is just the highest energy organ or tissue, but also

the most able to maintain a high degree of quiescence.

So in a sense, balding could be viewed as a brain excitotoxicity problem?

Is that what I'm hearing?

You're not keeping the back part of your brain differentiated adequately from the front.

If you raise your whole energy production, that whole syndrome of an earlobe crease and

high cholesterol and so on, it almost always goes with the chronic low temperature.

So since estrogen is such a powerful agent of decreasing core temperature, would you

say that agents that inhibit the synthesis of estrogen or block its effects, that would

be a more or less right approach for restoring hair growth?

The exact function of estrogen is to block a cell from going into that quiescent state

to force it to act immediately and intensely and lead to the reproductive processes, which

if you stay under the influence of estrogen, it will never go beyond the rapid multiplication

and growth phase.

You have to turn off that glycolytic type of metabolism and go to the oxidative, aiming

towards quiescence.

So speaking of quiescence, I have a question about the GABA system.

Everyone is a GABA agonist and there are many other drugs on the market that act on the

same system as agonists.

Would you say it would be counterproductive to try to target that specific system because

it would be too reductionist?

Let's say an overly excited cell, you give it a GABA agonist drug to calm it down, but

that in theory, in principle, shouldn't work very well unless you also address the

energetic deficiency, right?

What deficiency?

The energetic deficiency of the cell.

Yeah, you can't have meaningful quiescence if you're simply exhausted.

The Pavlovians had the idea of usually three energy states, the almost dead parabiotic

state and the intermediate state of sort of frenzied activity doing its function on and

off active contraction, relaxation and so on.

And then the high energy resting state in which it's simply quiescent but totally charged

up and ready to work.

These are good at getting into the high energy resting state and someone about to die tends

to have parts of the brain and other tissues lapse into the parabiotic almost dead state

just being quiet to save the last little bit of energy for surviving.

So psychiatry more or less as a profession is wasting both its time and the time of its

patients by administering all these GABA agonist drugs for all of these anxiety disorders and

all kinds of other psychiatric disorders that are really energetic in origin.

Yeah, they can be useful for a day or two if you use them to get some rest so that you

can build things up.

But they overlap and are in a way probably synonymous with the so-called calcium channels,

the excitotoxic NMDA receptors, the glutamate receptors, everything that stress and estrogen

turn on, that whole system turns off.

And progesterone, carbon dioxide, and all of the other good things suppress the excitotoxic

and promote the GABA relaxing system.

Between carbon dioxide and thyroid, go ahead, sorry.

Well you can pile up the nominal calcium channel blockers with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

and GABA receptors and so on.

A pile of them will usually be more effective than one of them, but still you've got to

work on the actual metabolism and get the blockers like enfatensin and aldosterone and

parathyroid hormone out of the way.

Speaking of the carbonic anhydrase, which do you think is more systemically beneficial,

thyroid hormone or carbon dioxide?

People who have looked for, among all known organisms, they could find lots of them that

can live without oxygen, but they couldn't find any single-celled organism that can live

continuously without carbon dioxide.

So it's the without which there is no life.

So if there was a way to package carbon dioxide as a drug or a supplement and then you have

thyroid as a supplement, I guess supplementing with carbon dioxide would be more systemic,

less risky?

Yeah, it will stop the stress and very often give you a chance to recover your own thyroid

function.

A good diet, if you can adapt to 10,000 feet altitude and then get a good diet, your thyroid

will usually recover.

At 8,000 to 9,000 or 10,000 feet, everyone loses unnecessary fat, their thyroid starts

working properly.

Is there an equivalent, I'm sure you're familiar with Addison disease, which is adrenal failure,

is there an equivalent disease for thyroid where the thyroid gland kind of completely

fails as the adrenals?

It used to be said to be killed by tuberculosis.

That was 150 years ago when they believed that the thyroid gland enlargement at that

time they thought might be inert by an infection, but it was probably just an extreme accumulation

of colloid from hypothyroidism.

I don't know of any actual confirmed disease in which the thyroid fails in itself, but

a lifetime, 30 or 40 years of supplementing too much iodine will increase fibrosis and

eventually carcinogenesis in the thyroid by driving high TSH activates cell deterioration,

fibrosis and inflammation.

And so you basically can drive it to death and fibrosis, but anytime you stop it while

there's still something alive, a few cells can regrow.

So just to summarize, so apparently supplementing with thyroid is not always necessary.

If one can radically re-engineer their life, just as you mentioned, go and live at high

altitude for let's say several months in a row, change their diet, completely eliminate

stress, then at least in principle thyroid function should be recoverable even without

thyroid supplementation.

Yeah, and a fat person takes longer because they'll have pounds of polyunsaturated fats

waiting there to come out and poison your thyroid.

Speaking of thyroid, Ray, something people push back on a lot is in your TSH temperature,

pulse rate and other indicators in hypothyroidism 2006, you wrote, "Healthy, intelligent groups

of people have been found to have average resting pulse rate of 85 per minute, while

less healthy groups average close to 70 per minute."

In my general experience of monitoring myself and talking to other people, that seems very

true, but what were you specifically thinking of when you wrote that?

Oh, particular studies in which they saw, looking at different populations, just the

relation of blood circulation to brain function and the freedom from sickness and so on, the

higher temperature, a good resting temperature right around 37 Celsius goes with good brain

function and general good health.

A few weeks ago on Twitter, low-carb and keto people were trying to one-up each other by

seeing who had the lowest pulse rate.

So I think 40 was the winner.

They were quoting articles saying that as your pulse rate went up, you all caused mortality

increase.

So what is your opinion on that?

There have been a couple big propaganda studies five or ten years ago, some in Denmark.

If you look at them carefully, they're just basically propaganda for selling blood pressure

drugs and things to regulate your heart rate and pressure.

And last thing, this is an article, I forget when it was, but the quote is, "The normal

heart rate for a newborn should be 140, reducing to 115 between six months and one year, 110

between one and two years, 103 between two and six, 95 age six to ten, and 85 between

ten and 14 years."

And that just reflects the lifelong decline of the metabolism.

Is that right?

Yeah.

The intelligence basically goes down with the metabolic rate.

I had a chance to give the RAVEN matrix tests to some kids at different ages.

And my niece, for example, when she was eight, scored the same raw score as a university

math professor, but when she was in her teens, she scored exactly the same score and hadn't

advanced a bit.

And just being around kids, you can see that at eight or nine, they're as bright as they're

ever going to be.

And just some random questions, unless you have questions about that, Dorji.

One thing I am interested in is a half a grain dose versus a full grain.

And you wrote to somebody in 2018 and you said, "If your diet lacks something such as

selenium or vitamin D that's needed for thyroid to work, T4 can interfere with the effects

of T3.

If you take 25 or 50 micrograms in a single daily dose of T4, the liver will experience

a momentary toxic overdose and over a period of a week or two will adapt to detoxification

enzymes to destroy it, with the result of the body will be extremely deficient in thyroid

most of the day and with a short period of toxic excess."

So I guess what I'm getting at is, is it always safer to dose a half a grain at a time

versus a full grain because the more than 25 or 50 micrograms could be harmful to somebody?

With the natural glandular material, if you take it with food, it isn't all going to be

digested for hours.

Some of it is going to travel down your intestine.

So with natural thyroid, you don't get such a bad effect as with a pure chemical.

I experienced it myself taking 25 micrograms of T3 only in the morning and I don't remember

how many weeks it was, but just a few weeks and my heart began pausing for seconds at

a time around sunset every day and I found at sunset taking 5 or 10 micrograms and rubbing

it on the roof of my mouth, within 10 or 15 seconds, my heart rhythm was going from pausing

every 10 seconds to a restored perfect rhythm.

You know what, I think I just realized I've been reading this paragraph wrong for years.

You're talking about T3 in this, you're not talking about T4.

Is there an unsafe amount of T4 to take at a single time?

I was thinking the 25 to 50 was T4, but you're obviously talking about T3.

Yeah, T4 is more slowly metabolized anyway, so it's going to equilibrate into your tissues

at its background level is so much higher than T3 that the effect is going to be a lot

slower.

If you lack selenium and aren't converting it, then it does build up over the weeks and

it reaches the point where it interferes with T3 and becomes antithyroid.

So one last question about this.

So if a person were using Cynoplus and they needed hypothetically two grains, would that

be, and maybe the person's sensitive, or you're talking to a random person and you don't know

how sensitive they are, would it be safer to talk about half a grain four times a day

or would one grain twice a day be perfectly okay?

Yeah, one tablet of Cynoplus is like a little over two grains of armor and one tablet I

think has 30 micrograms of T3 and so if you take that on an empty stomach and absorb it

quickly, it's going to have that upsetting effect and your liver is going to eventually

give you a low T3 effect.

But the one grain at a time, 10 micrograms of T3 and 40 micrograms of T4, is that risky

to take at one time?

Not with food.

Food is going to slow it out.

And last question, would you chew it or just swallow the pill whole?

If you need, like I wanted my heart to not stop for three seconds at a time and so I

chewed it up and got the almost instantaneous effect.

If you're having terrible insomnia, chewing up 10 micrograms can put you to sleep in a

few minutes.

People with agonizing breast pain have chewed up 10 micrograms and found the pain was absolutely

stopped in 10 or 15 minutes.

I have a question about supplementing with thyroid.

Considering the fact that fatty acids, especially PUFA, interfere with both the transport and

the uptake and the effects of thyroid hormone in the cell, would it be pertinent to try

to lower the fatty acids around the time somebody is taking thyroid?

Like take it with niacinamide and/or aspirin or any other measure that lowers free fatty

acids?

It's always good to keep the free fatty acids low.

But it wouldn't have any kind of synergistic effect to do that when you're taking thyroid?

In other words, to get more use of the thyroid you're already ingesting.

Would it help to in this specific case?

In the case of glandular thyroid, the unsaturated fats are even blocking the breakdown in your

stomach and the further metabolism in your body is being blocked at all different points

by polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Oh wow, so you won't even break down the thyroglobulin in the stomach when you're

taking the glandular?

Some of the food technology people have reasoned that the reason for polyunsaturated fats in

so many seeds is to block mammalian stomach enzymes to make the seed unnutritious so they

all stop eating it because it blocks the proteolytic enzymes.

Ray, I know it's getting pretty late so I'm conscious of the time and I'll let

you go.

The last question I had for you was do you have a strong opinion about what's going

on in Antarctica?

This has been a mild fascination of mine and I watched a pretty good video about it and

they threw out a bunch of things from magnetic anomalies to weather experiments to a source

of uranium and a bunch of old newspapers describing snow-free land on Antarctica and things like

that.

Have you studied the topic?

Do you have a strong opinion about it?

No, not a bit.

Have you seen the news recently about the neutrinos, the high-energy neutrinos they

found in that detector in Antarctica and they're saying these particles should not exist, something's

wrong with the standard model, but nobody's saying the obvious which may be that the earth

is creating new matter and that's the reason why these high-energy neutrinos are there.

Are they coming in a certain direction out of the earth or falling?

Yes, and they're saying they're coming out of the earth and of course the main theory

is like well, clearly the assumption is they're not coming from the earth, in other words

the earth is not the source so if they're coming from the outer space, how the hell

are they going through the entire earth and are coming out of the South Pole but we're

not detecting them at the North Pole and nobody's saying the obvious which is maybe they originated

from the earth.

I just thought it's been boggling the scientific minds for the last three or four years, it

hits the news every once in a while.

I don't know if you've seen it on the news or not.

No, that would be very important if the earth is emitting them.

Do you know the neutrino sea theory?

Dudley?

The one from Dudley?

Of course, Dudley, yeah.

I read one paper, I was only able to find one thing in a PDF file online and it's basically

saying that the stars are creating this stream of neutrinos and they're the source of all

matter and I think the Electric Universe Theory folks have been confirming that and saying

yes the electric force acts upon the neutrinos and when they split they form these cosmic

rays and all new matter that we're seeing around us.

That was just I think a minor part.

His general thing was that the universe is pervaded by a neutrino sea which possibly

has a dielectric effect and for that reason neutrinos naturally associate with charged

matter, all matter being charged, so the concentration of neutrinos increases in proportion to matter

and it fits with the Hindu guys' theory of gravity as a dielectric phenomenon with the

neutrino sea being the dielectric which associates with matter.

I happened to look up another paper that a professor had mentioned by a physicist named

Anderson in which the presence of a monolayer of a radioactive material on a crystalline

material, in this case a radioactive vegetable oil on aluminum foil, he showed that the supposedly

stochastic nuclear decay was nonrandom when the oil was spread out in a monolayer and

that paper was published in the same journal of the Italian physics journal in which Dudley

published his neutrino sea argument predicting that crystalline matter would act as a beam,

a focuser of this neutrino sea which associates as a dielectric but it would be altered in

the presence of crystalline matter in which the charges are arranged in an orderly way

and he predicted that the crystal structure could regulate nuclear decay and warned that

the state of nuclear fuel in reactors or weapons could govern the spontaneous fission and make

it unpredictable so his article was a warning but Anderson's article neither of them knew

about the other but the experimental evidence happened to be published at the same time

the theory was.

So basically nuclear weapons are incurrently unstable, they may self-combust, well not

self-combust but self-ignite?

Yeah, and so if there's for example uranium ore at the South Pole this could be the equivalent

of the reactive stuff being focused, focusing the neutrinos and so it could be another confirmation

of Dudley and Anderson.

In one of your interviews you talked about the piece of matter existing through time

would convert this neutrino stream into energy and you called it a neg entropy, can you expand

a little bit on that?

Is that how basically matter is sustained as a stable substance by through this neutrino

sea that's passing through it?

Yeah, that was Dudley's view that it was participating in the mere mass attracting

the neutrinos which affect such things as nuclear decay that the mass is acting on itself

through the neutrino sea in such things as generating order.

What do you think Kozyrev was measuring when he was doing his experiments with what he

called processes that emit or absorb time?

What do you think he was measuring in those experiments?

Basically just energy and when energy appears unaccountably he did calculations to show

why the passage of time is always adding a certain amount of energy to the system which

would involve Dudley's neutrino sea but Kozyrev called it time.

But empirically he started his theory to predict the source of stellar energy and scaling the

mass of a star down, the mass of the sun corresponded according to his astronomical measurements

to all of the stars he was looking at and so he looked at the planets and finally the

dark side of the moon as the smallest accessible planet and aiming his spectroscopic telescope

on the dark of the moon with a photographic plate in it he photographed red spots periodically

in the volcanic areas of the moon.

Volcanic eruptions were recorded and American astronomers said he was just a drunk Russian,

there can't be volcanic action on the moon.

But most recently there's an anomalous heat emission from I think it's next to the last

gaseous planet and this very recent new data about the heat coming out of this planet fits

his predictions according to the mass all the planets except Venus are emitting the

same energy in relation to mass as the moon and the sun and stars.

Two more questions related to that, are you aware of any follow-up work after Dudley's

publications?

Anybody who took this up and developed it further?

Nope.

Nope, okay.

And if we assume that the neutrino sea is also synonymous for that electrically charged

ether or not electrically charged but ether with electrical properties, I'm sure you're

familiar with the ether drift experiments which some people say were falsified.

Yeah, it's exactly if the neutrino sea is the ether and it's attracted simply as a dielectric

very very light gas then you would have some drift, some carries some of it along with

some of it slips through.

So Dudley exactly calculated things that were consistent with the measurements.

There was a physicist who apparently repeated the experiment to detect the ether in the

80s.

He worked for Caltech and NASA.

I'm blanking on his name, I think his last name was either Silver or Silverstein.

Long story short, he found that the earth has basically a drift, it's basically moving

preferentially in space towards the Sagittarius constellation.

So he not only said that the ether probably exists but also that its flow seems to have

a preferential direction.

Would you have any opinion on why that direction may exist and is there anything special towards

the ether moving preferentially in a certain direction?

Well like the electric universe, the universe is a thing and it must obey any laws of physics

that are valid and so that's just another unexplored part of the universe.

So maybe there's more matter there and the neutrinos are drawn towards that part of the

universe?

Yeah, the universe is doing something we haven't found out yet.

What do you think black holes are?

Aside from them being a completely fake object that astronomy is trying to convince us are

breaking the laws of physics, do you think they're just special regions of space attracting

neutrinos somehow?

Yeah, I think mostly they're something designed to fit the paradigm.

Have you read Seeing Red?

Halton Arp?

Yeah, Halton Arp.

His observations didn't at all fit with the Big Bang explanation of redshift and redshift

goes with the neutrino sea and electric universe and so on.

So they wouldn't let him use the telescope anymore.

Speaking of the electric universe, Ray, do you have an opinion on what's it called,

the movie they made?

It's called Symbols of an Alien Sky where they think the planets used to be in a different

conformation.

Does that make sense to you at all?

For everything is changing.

But specifically they're saying those conformations explain a lot of history.

Would you take it that far?

Do you think that is a reasonable explanation?

Yeah.

Oh, nice.

Georgie, have you seen it?

It's an excellent documentary.

It's really fascinating.

What was the debate by an astronomer?

Was it Vernadsky who had a huge argument with the astronomical community who said that the

Earth has experienced a lot of cataclysms in recent history?

Velikovsky, I think.

Velikovsky, yes.

So maybe that's what he was referring to.

Maybe because of that different configuration, the cataclysms on Earth are what all these

big religions are talking about.

Yeah.

I've read him and I think his arguments are plausible.

That's everything.

You know what?

The one last thing we didn't touch on that I put in the title and then we'll read the

Super Chats and I'll let you go, Ray.

Do you want to just talk about DHT?

What is your general rundown of that?

Because I think you've described it in email, but I can't think of an interview where you've

ever really talked about it.

I'm sure you have.

But what is your general thought on dihydrotestosterone?

In general, things like that are not to be messed with unless you have a very specific

knowledge of a deficiency because if you take a little too much, any of those defining feature-creating

hormones can change the whole system in an unpredictable way.

I would suggest first getting a good picture of what the problem is.

There are usually more ways to fix it.

Correcting thyroid vitamin D and DHEA and pregnenolone will usually bring your DHT up

to where it should be.

In something like breast cancer or prostate cancer, it's one of the things that can give

a big push to the system if you're wanting to interrupt the process.

In health, sickness and disease, do you see it ever being warranted to supplement with

DHT directly?

I know you said you should always correct the upstream things first, but do you see

DHT like a progesterone maybe for males or is it not that simple?

No.

Pregnenolone is the first thing and then DHEA if you need a more androgenic thing.

Androgen will push your neurosteroids, the crucial regulating things that you don't

want to throw out of balance and with a strong androgen like DHT, that would be one big risk

that you could throw off your neurosteroids.

Can you dive into that a little bit more?

How would that work?

If you have a definite problem that you want to fix, osteoporosis or cancer for example,

then you can use it to the effect and you'll see the effect.

Doses for that for the people that do need it?

One milligram.

One milligram daily dissolved in tocopherol say or like taken with fat?

Uh-huh.

Okay.

Well, Ray, you do have that quote about testosterone and you say it's essential to have everything

else in place, thyroid, calcium, magnesium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin E, pregnenolone,

DHEA, then one milligram per day can have a very strong effects and a person could spend

five years optimizing those things.

So do you have a similar point of view with DHT?

You just need to put a bunch of things in place before kind of even thinking about experimenting

with it?

Yeah.

The DHT, you don't have to worry quite as much as you do with testosterone, but if you're

very sparing with the testosterone, even DHEA can feminize a man.

If he takes 25 milligrams a day and almost every day I hear someone taking injections

of 30 or 50 milligrams of testosterone per week, which is several times what a teenage

boy would be making.

And so it's all going to be going towards estrogen and doing more harm than good.

Yeah.

I know Georgie and I have talked about this many times that that is such a common therapy

of like gigantic doses of testosterone.

And so I'm glad you touched on it.

Georgie, do you have anything else before we move on to super chats and we end this

whole thing?

Yeah, I guess, I mean, my last question would relate to DHEA.

Do you have an opinion of why the endocrinological industry came up with these insane daily recommendations?

I mean, I know personally an endocrinologist and they think that 25 milligrams of DHEA

daily is a minuscule dosage, despite the many studies showing that anything over 10 or 15

milligrams daily reliably increases estrogen.

They just keep saying no, 25 milligrams.

You'll see studies even titled saying low dose DHEA administration does X.

And you look at the study and they use 25, 50 milligrams and they're calling it a low

dose.

Well, if you find out what endocrinologists and pulmonologists, et cetera, are actually

reading, it's pitiful.

They simply don't know anything about their field.

But you think that they can at least do the, this just a mechanical work of calculating

what would be a physiological dose of DHEA?

Can they drop to that level of stupidity, not even being able to calculate that?

Yeah, it's a whole attitude of applying intelligence to physiology or anything in the world.

They are trained in an authoritarian system of obedience.

And it's very hard to talk intelligence to someone with that 10 or 20 years of training

in that direction.

Have you ever met a doctor who managed to get shaken out of this zombified dream somehow?

Oh yeah.

Patients who did something like an allergy specialist who was making huge amounts, $400

an hour or something, desensitizing people to allergen, to whatever they were allergic

to by injecting a little bit of the allergen.

And they kept coming back every week needing to be desensitized again.

And he found out that giving them some T3 and magnesium at the same time, they retained

the magnesium under the influence of T3 and never came back.

In a week he cured all his patients and went into another business.

So what would trigger an allergy specialist to even consider T3 and magnesium?

Were they somehow inspired by you or did they read something?

Okay.

Yeah, we were talking about it.

Okay, Georgie, go ahead.

No, that's it.

That's it.

I don't have anything.

Okay, I'll run through these super chats.

You guys, I'd love to get through all these questions, but we would just be on here for

hours.

And so obviously for these to Ray, Ray, you got my last Ford from the AdSense from Google,

right?

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

That was everybody here.

So you guys are making this happen.

Appreciate it.

Thank you so much.

Matthew Riley, thank you for 999.

Mateo White, White shirts for 20 pesos.

Thank you.

This one, I'm going to break my rule and read it because it seems particularly important.

It's from tone for $10.

And he says, my cousin was shot and left paralyzed waist down, but showing signs that he can

fully recover.

Any thoughts on wound induced paralysis from a bioenergetic point of view, studying T3,

T4, progesterone, CO2, and aspirin at the moment.

Ray, what do you think about that?

Nerve recovery, progesterone and pregnenolone and vitamin D and thyroid and carbon dioxide

are central things.

So just the things he was studying already.

So that's great.

Jonas for a hundred of some currency.

I'm not sure.

Thank you so much.

Janet, thank you so much for $50 wealth.

Diana or Bella Glynn for 24.99.

Oh, Janet says, thank you so much for doing these chats.

Diana says, thank you all for sharing your knowledge.

Thank you, Diana.

Christina Tomaj for 24.99.

Thank you so much.

Primitive initiative for 999.

Thank you so much.

He says, thank you for taking the time to do these lives.

Danny, Georgie and Ray, Harry Burgos for $25.

No message.

Thank you so much, Harry.

Machel, I won't even try to pronounce your last name for $20.

Thank you so much, Machel.

And then we have an extra second.

I'm just going to read this last super chat and then we'll, we'll farewell out of here.

But Vicky says, I guess it wouldn't really be fair if I, okay.

Okay.

I'm just going to end it there.

Vicky, forward me your question.

I'll try to answer to the best of my ability for 4.99.

Thank you so much, Vicky.

Okay.

Ray, any parting words on the general state of things?

What are you working on right now?

Your life in general?

A newsletter on the epidemic or the pandemic and concrete things that can be done and some

basic ideas on how to think about viruses and reasons to avoid vaccines in particular.

And you sent me a kind of a rough draft of that.

When do you think that will be ready?

Oh, a few days.

That was the first page changed already.

And then Georgie, any parting words?

I guess one last question, Ray, if you had to leave the empire, what for you would be

the breaking point?

What signs in the environment would you say would be a pretty decent indication that it's

time to pack up and go somewhere else?

Oh, when they interrupt my food and drugs, if they turn off my thyroid, Cynomel, the

Cynoplus and start changing the food supply, then it's necessary to leave.

What about forced vaccinations?

Would that be a good sign?

Oh, sure.

All right.

I'm so sorry.

Ray, how do you think that will be implemented?

Like, how do you what what is the because so many people seem resistant to it.

Do you think working for these corporations, obviously, but what about the normal person?

How do you think they'll incentivize a vaccine besides using fear?

Well, even even normal doctors are starting to refuse vaccines for their kids.

And so the the normal American is still absolutely subservient to the stupid things their doctors

do to them.

That whole thing has to change.

The vaccines might be a catalyst for people throwing off the whole crazy authoritarian

medical system.

Great stuff, Ray.

You know, infinite appreciation for you joining us.

Sincerely appreciate it.

These are special episodes to me.

And so thank you for joining us and just sharing your wisdom with us.

And thank you, Georgie, for being my partner and helping me do this because I couldn't

do this without you.

Thank you, everybody listening and watching.

Ray, I'll send you an email and we'll try to set up another one of these if you're available.

And just thank you so much.

Sincerely appreciate it.

Everybody have a great, safe Friday evening.

And we'll see you guys some other time.

Take care.Okay, we're live. Georgi Dinkov, Raymond Peat, thank you guys so much for joining us. Georgi,

go back to your question. I won't interfere. Go ahead.

Yeah, I want to, I mean, it's an expansion to what we've been discussing, but aside from

Otto Warburg, Szent-Györgyi, and I guess Ilya Prigogine, do you know of any other scientists

who got the Nobel Prize for actually humanistic work, for work that expanded knowledge and

science for the benefit of humanity, or does it seem to be mostly awarded for pathological

ideas these days?

Metchnikoff.

Metchnikoff, okay. But that seems to be like, you know, you can count these people on one

hand and they've been, you know, Nobel winners across a hundred years. So this means a very

small minority of good awards, the vast majority of them being mostly pathological discoveries.

Yeah, and Metchnikoff shared his with Paul Ehrlich, who represented the business monopoly,

chemical monopoly world.

Right. Are you familiar with the work of Luc Montagnier, the co-discoverer of HIV?

Yeah, I've followed it out in detail, but on and off since about 1980.

Have you noticed that he's become a pariah in the scientific community because he started

talking about HIV being not really as dangerous unless you have a bad lifestyle and, you know,

low metabolism, essentially. He's talking about curing autism with antibiotics, which

of course implicates serotonin. And this guy is now gone. He used to be the director of

the Pasteur Institute in Paris. And I think now he hides. He's in hiding. Used to be in

Africa, now he's in China, but nobody really knows where he is. And everybody says he's

insane.

Yeah. Much later, you know, when Peter Duesberg questioned, he sort of started the virus gene

connection in cancer and money began flowing from the government and the cancer research.

And then he said, "Wait a minute, I was mistaken there." Went on to other work, and as long

as he stayed out of the direct interfering with the funding of the nonsense oncogene

virus work, he continued his research. But then when he questioned whether the HIV retrovirus

caused AIDS, that was the last straw. Even the other professors at the university told

graduate students not to attend his seminars or courses, and NIH cut off funding. All of

the science organizations stopped inviting him because he would be a threat, the risk

of asking embarrassing questions. Have you heard Kary Mullis talk about Luc Montagnier

and Peter Duesberg?

No, no, I haven't.

He was sort of a hyperactive kid who went into science and didn't let his intelligence

be ruined by getting trained in science. And so he continued to look at evidence and ask

questions. And once he went up to Montagnier at a meeting and said he needed a reference,

he was writing a grant, said he needed a reference for this statement, "HIV is the probable cause

of AIDS." And Montagnier referred him to the declaration by the NIH that in fact it

is the cause. And Kary Mullis said, "Well, but there was no evidence mentioned there."

And so Montagnier said, "Well, recently someone showed that by treating a retrovirus in a

certain way you could get it to kill chimpanzees in a week after you inject it." And Mullis

pointed out that that has nothing to do with deficiency syndrome. And he said Montagnier

just walked away, no more questions.

Well, it's becoming too dangerous for him to speak, right?

Yeah, but then 30 years later, the science world turned away from him.

Have you seen some of his other work on bacteria and DNA emitting electromagnetic waves and

changing the structure of water?

Yeah, I haven't looked closely at how they pick up the signals and analyze it, but they

say that they're getting signals, sort of an echo in the water, which if people don't

have a challenge, you have to approximate the measuring system before you can say it

simply doesn't exist.

Yeah, he was actually able to replicate the HIV virus across two different containers

of serum. And the second one didn't have any, but it was in close proximity, didn't have

any trace of the virus. And he confirmed this with a PCR test. But if the second container

was in close proximity to the one that contained the virus, and both of them were in a resonating

field of the Schumann resonance frequency, which I think is between six and 10 Hertz,

the earth apparently emits it, then apparently after about 12 hours, he could actually prove

that the second container was able to fully replicate the virus if you give it the starting

materials, like if you give it like a RNA and the actual enzyme, I guess, DNA polymerase,

is that what it's called?

Yeah, that sort of thing has been around, I think it was in 1940, someone was adding

proteins to different types of cells and finding that the cell could replicate and that the

offspring would still contain that protein, and they would do it for several generations.

And one of these was showing that with extreme techniques for removing any contaminating

protein, that they would calculate the amount of protein coming out of the cell, and it

would be thousands of times greater than the amount of protein the cell had been exposed

to a foreign protein, and very clear evidence that on a single exposure, a human cell could

absorb and copy and produce unlimited quantities of a foreign protein, meaning that it had

not only copied DNA, it had translated the protein into RNA or DNA, and then used the

nucleic acid to produce endless quantities of that protein.

The amount after 100 generations or so, they said, would be thousands of tons of starting

material if it had been a matter of absorption and dilution.

Okay, here's a follow-up, fascinating question related to that.

We as bodies are essentially bigger replicas of these containers that Montagnier was using.

If two people, one of them HIV positive or carrying any other virus or pathogen, really

for that matter, are in close proximity for a sufficiently long period of time, and we

are all bathing in human residence all the time because that's what the earth emits

as electromagnetic frequency, wouldn't that imply that we could potentially replicate

the infection into a healthy person without any actual physical pathogen exchanging places?

So there's no need for direct infection?

I think it works the other way, that a healthy person is going to give the sick person a

boost to eradicate the problem.

I think that's how life has been working all along.

It's not just a little particle of new DNA that they created to make them immune to something

in the environment such as an antibiotic, to pass it on to other bacteria to replicate

and protect themselves.

Whether it requires passing a chunk of DNA or simply the information needed to make the

DNA protein, I think the protective healing effect is likely to be predominant unless

the whole system is so sick that it's on the way to dying as a whole.

So would you say it's a sort of an averaging effect?

So if you have more healthy organisms in a community, and then let's say you have five

organisms, three are healthy, two are sick, then on average you'll have like, I don't

know, three-fifths of a healthy person per person?

I mean, I know I'm simplifying it, but because I'm tying this to Kammerer's work on seriality

and how systems tend to approximate each other and imitate each other.

So the whole community tends toward like a similarity or an average of a sort.

So would you say that there will be like a slight decline in the health of the healthy

person and a boost in the sick one?

Or is it strictly a one directional thing where the healthy people are pulling the sick

towards health and it's just a matter of the number of the healthy people you have?

Yeah, I think there's sort of a ratchet on it in the direction of surviving healthy and

superior individuals.

And it requires a sickness of the whole community before you get regression.

So the reason I'm asking this is because I'm sure, and actually you've said in several

interviews that we should try to surround ourselves with healthy, positively minded

people and that certain people can be really toxic, which leads me to another question

I'll ask later on.

But so if a healthy person is more or less, I don't want to say immune, but if it's the

sick people that benefit, then there shouldn't be a danger really if we're surrounded by

sick negatively minded people.

Or is there another mechanism through which they can hurt our health?

I don't think so.

If you have, for example, a geographic area where sick people have accumulated because

of some cultural habits like drug use, then you can have such a sick environment that

it would take a big infusion of healthy people and there would be social, political conflict

between the people with the unhealthy culture.

You have to look at the number of people supporting an unhealthy culture and the number of people

running around obediently wearing masks and behaving stupidly.

It reaches a point where it feels like it's bad for one's health.

Speaking of that, you know, I was last time we did this, I was in a smaller town called

Pichit and we came to Chiang Mai, which is like a bigger city in Thailand.

And to get to the good grocery store, you have to go into a mall.

And so you have to put a QR code.

Right now I think it's kind of voluntary, but you're expected to do it.

A QR code, wash your hands, which I don't do, get temperature checked, and then be screened

by a thermal scanner.

And that's just to get into the mall.

And then there's guards on, not like there's people watching people on from each level

of the mall.

And then to get into the grocery store, you're expected to also do a QR code and to write

your name down and to get temperature checked.

And so, yeah, it's definitely hitting a reality check point of just total insanity.

And then also I didn't wear my mask or I wore it and then took it off when I got into the

store and a woman chased me throughout the store to tell me to put it back on.

And so I could see how a non-crazy person might be okay with that, but it definitely

reduces, it makes me crazy.

And so it's hard to handle for sure.

Ray, you guys, both of you guys, DC is...

Sorry, go ahead, Ray.

What was the...

No question, just many statements.

But I was just... it was just a realization because the Peachett town was very small and

they didn't have these orders to do this kind of stuff.

And then coming to the bigger city was a realization of what life was going...

I guess the TSA-ification of daily tasks.

And the TSA is one situation where it makes my blood pressure go up through the roof.

And so that just sounds like a terrible life and fits into that killer austerity idea that

we've been talking about a lot.

Yeah.

Even when people are alone, walking down Freeline Street with no one within 200 feet, wearing

a mask in hot weather, obviously suffers.

I don't know, pitiful or something to see such terrible obedience.

Well, don't worry, Ray, because apparently the experts say that protests of up to 100

people are okay, but social outdoor gatherings of only up to 12 people.

And then...

I mean, it's...

Aren't they... is the population so dumbed...

This is an obvious showing of the hand or something because it's so absurd.

But what do you think the point of them even putting this stuff up, stuff out through the

news is?

It's so bizarre that they would... these would be talking points on the news.

Yeah, that thing about the 100 people allowed to protest, it shows that if people just ignore

them, they'll change their rules so that they seem to be in control.

And since you have a broad, broad view of these types of things, I did want to talk

about race a little bit.

What is your... over the course of your life, what is your general perception of how racial

tensions get stoked just in your experience?

I took a couple of into and through the Southern states, 1960 and 1964.

And even though I thought of myself as being a white person, I was for some reason seen

by the natives as at least as dangerous as a black person.

I'm not sure what it was, but I narrowly escaped getting killed a couple of times, once on

each trip.

And I stayed away after the second time for about 30 years.

But I saw it as just the worst sort of sadistic xenophobia.

I can see why black people would shuffle and say, "Yes, if I thought that would have saved

me, I might have tried that."

But something about my face or my manner made them want to kill me.

Can you go into that a little more?

Was it like, were you protesting or was it your friend group or what?

Yeah, go into that a little more.

That's really interesting.

They just targeted you for some unknown reason?

It must've been that I had an out-of-state driver's license and fat sideburns and probably

dressed in an unconventional way.

I'm not sure, but you could see the hatred emanating when I would stop at a gas station

or something.

I would love to see that picture of you with the fat sideburns.

Yeah, can we please see those?

I would pay to see that one actually.

On those trips, I talked to only one sane person in the whole South who was an Irishman,

a motel owner, immigrant from Ireland.

Somehow he was surviving there.

It was a general culture of total obedience to some mysterious standard of being.

Speaking of the, since we're already on the topic of racism, do you think these protests

that are going on right now are actually achieving anything?

Or do you think that similar in spirit to the MLK movement, because none of these people

has been killed yet, we kind of know that it's really just, not that they're, I mean,

they believe they're changing things, but really no fundamental change is really happening.

Because if it is, if these people are really putting a dent into the system, people will

start dying.

Yeah, they aren't really doing anything threatening to the system.

Getting city council people to say they'll defund the police.

What does that mean?

That the police will incorporate, privatize, and then be autonomous?

Somehow the whole system has to be broken up.

Crime has to be recognized when it's committed by police.

But the Nazis and Klansmen have infiltrated many of the police departments.

So there is organized racism and classism, wanting to kill homeless people as well as

black people.

In one of your interviews, you spoke about how the Occupy Wall Street movement could

have been the, really the real party for everybody, for the majority of the population, but it

got infiltrated and manipulated away from making any real demands.

And there were also snipers ready to take out the real leaders.

Have you seen something similar happening with the current Black Lives Matter movement?

Yeah, by avoiding the general class question, making it too narrow and things that won't

get real continuous support.

A lot of the people that voted for Trump had mistaken understanding about what class is

and what really threatens them.

And those people should be incorporated into a reform that eliminates crime in all directions,

but especially obliterates the organized crime of the police forces.

Can we jump back a little bit?

You're talking about the police being Klansmen and such.

Has anything shifted?

I would never stick up for police.

I've never met a police officer that I liked or had any positive experiences with them.

But was there any kind of change?

Because the dominant narrative right now is that white supremacists are the most...

This paper talking about white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates

and contributes to COVID-19.

And then the basic ideas of a white privilege or white savior complex or white guilt or

white fragility and these terms just being so synonymous with activism nowadays, but

it's obviously some kind of overt racism.

And so again, I don't care about defending white people.

I could care less, but it just seems a little bit odd that that is the dominant narrative

that so-called, using air quotes, "white people" are responsible for all the problems that

we're seeing nowadays.

When Martin Luther King began emphasizing the problems of white people, almost immediately

that was when he got killed.

What made it a non-racial, but a class issue.

Well, I guess that's what I'm getting at.

I don't doubt that there's actual racism for sure, but how is that used to, I don't know,

occupy the minds of people in favor of not thinking about class and just somebody that

doesn't know what class is, how would you define that?

The simply not possessing property, not having the social power and privilege above the middle

income in the country.

People are able to think of going to college and buying a house and so on.

The lower half of the population realizes or should realize that they are in the lower

class, but they've been taught to call everyone down to about $15,000 a year income, middle

class.

So just turning the thought process to thinking about will it be possible to have those things,

to get the education you want and to be secure or will you always be struggling to rise socially?

What's happening now with the pandemic is clearly designed to destroy all of those people

who have thought of themselves as the middle class and some of the actual middle class

is going down.

As the unemployment rate goes up, lots of small and medium-sized businesses are failing.

If traditional cyclic unemployment was causing hundreds of thousands of deaths by suicide

and alcoholism and drugs, imagine what the destruction of all of these businesses and

jobs will do.

It will be killing millions of people.

We kind of touched upon this in the last show, but isn't this a bit of a plane with fire

on behalf of the powers that be?

At some point, a lot of people in this country are armed.

If you push them into a corner, there's no telling what they will do and there's largely

no controlling them.

Or do you think they're firmly under control and they will never revolt or cause another

civil war or God knows what else?

The people causing their problems have tremendous security forces.

People like Fauci, you can't even get close to at a scientific meeting to ask a question.

They aren't subject to force of that sort.

They don't have anyone to shoot, despite how many guns they have.

They're infinitely outgunned.

So that sort of revolt is worse than useless.

Well, since it's already underway, do you expect sort of like a large-scale kind of

collapse here in the United States in the next few years?

I can't see how it can do anything but get worse until maybe if five or ten million people

would start rejecting orders and instructions, that might cause a movement that could save

the whole country, the whole world.

Do you think the declining population of the young has something to do with the fact that

people are so obedient and willing to follow orders?

I mean, I'm sure you've seen the news where they say there are studies that have come

out that say that now a 30-year-old person on average has the same health or bad health

as a person who is 60 years old.

So the young have become the old.

There's no chronological and biological age.

So they've basically completely diverged.

You can tell a person's biological age, in other words, health, by kind of asking them

how old they are.

These days, you're just as likely to find cancer in an 18-year-old as potentially in

a 40-year-old, right?

Do you see this as contributing to the problem?

Going in that direction, definitely.

The allergies and systemic inflammation is becoming the worst plague.

Young Americans are dying at a higher rate than most other countries from the coronavirus

because of the background of extreme vaccination, use of birth control and other estrogen, SSRI,

increasing serotonin exposure, all kinds of pro-inflammatory things make young people

in this country a lot more vulnerable to relatively harmless viruses like the corona.

There is a horrible video floating around of like an 8-year-old boy and his mom is holding

his hand and there's two nurses giving him multiple vaccine injections while he's like

screaming.

It's really one of the most disturbing things I've watched in a long time.

They only gave him like four or five vaccines, but I know that they need to get many, many,

many more.

But it was just a video that perfectly encapsulated that process.

One last question about race.

Ray, as a biologist, is racism just like a product of a low IQ individual?

Is there a biological imperative to seek out your own type of person?

No, I don't think it's biological.

Going into a pure indigenous population, sometimes I got off the road in Mexico and I would find

myself among oddly clothed indigenous people.

They didn't seem unfriendly, but they were definitely puzzled by having such a strange

person there.

I think it depends on their experience as a group.

If they haven't been robbed or attacked by foreigners, they just are curious and wonder

why you're so different.

But other groups will get together and organize some ways to get rid of you.

I think that's all cultural and based on their group experience and stereotypes that have

developed.

Speaking of, I want to finish up the topic of the collapse.

So what do you think is the end game here?

You said before it's a streamlined economy so there can be a better chance of competing

with China.

Is that what it's all about?

Just competing with the new empire?

Yeah, bringing the empire rapidly to absolute world control.

And China is the big, massive impediment to that.

So they see China prepared to do a better job of automating everything and increasing

efficiency.

So they want to hurt all of the economies and be the only ones who reach the automation

through artificial intelligence and use that along with some kind of fear to control people.

There might be something other than viruses, but viruses are currently doing the job.

They'll save us with vaccines.

If vaccines don't work, then they'll require everyone to take some kind of a drug, but

anything to get people obedient enough to take their treatment.

So do you think China jumped on this as an opportunity as well to even further streamline

and put its own population out of control?

Because they must be seeing through this charade for what it is, but they seem to be going

along with it at least partially as well.

Yeah, I think part of that is a matter of sophistication.

Very few people are talking about the germ warfare thing.

It briefly came out in February or March, each side accusing the other of deliberately

spreading it to weaken the other's economy.

But anyone who knows the actual history knows that the US has been in the business for the

whole 20th century basically.

And so China doesn't want to get in that competition, I suppose.

That's the only confusing thing for me.

I feel like the war tension with Russia has been being stoked for a long time.

And again, I could be just ignorant, but the China thing doesn't seem like they've been

pushing that as hard.

What was that?

Romney and Obama.

And Romney said Russia was the largest threat.

And Obama said the 1950s called and they wanted their foreign policy back or whatever.

But since the Hillary and Trump in 2016, there's been like a war drum for Russia.

But you're saying there's tension specifically between the US and China, but also the US

tends to or these search and think groups tends to praise China how they're handling

coronavirus and then implementing the changes they've made here.

And so maybe it's like more of a friendly competition or something.

Who would see it as friendly?

Again, from just my ignorant point of view, you're saying it's a tension between China

and the US of what's happening right now.

Like that's why all this stuff is happening to maintain the dominant empire.

Yeah.

China's population being so huge relative to the US and the US population is huge relative

to Russia.

The real drift of history is strongly in the direction of China.

Now that they've got an efficient economy and a unified government, the population is

almost a determinant of the outcome.

And so extraordinary measures are needed to change that trend of history.

And then one last question on this.

We might've talked about this the first time, but are things declining despite the elites

conspiring to do these things?

Like do the elites know that there is a bad time coming ahead, therefore coronavirus,

racial tension, et cetera, et cetera?

Or is it totally manufactured by them?

I heard that Bill Gates, his income has been a billion dollars a week during the lockdown.

No, I think it's exactly what they want.

Nothing hurts them.

So if the population is the determining factor, could all other things being equal in developed

economies like let's say China, Russia, and the United States, then wouldn't it make sense

for the United States as bad as it sounds to do something nefarious to, I don't know,

decimate China's population, but prop up its own instead of decimating its own population?

Or does the empire not really care about the United States as a country?

It's more like a transnational cabal that can really take a seat and can sort of...

The industry went to China and so most Americans are useless in the sense of producing profit

for the financial class.

And so they aren't going to lose anything if suddenly millions and millions of middle

class and lower class Americans start dying off.

Their income is going to accelerate for quite a while in proportion to the die off of masses

of Americans.

But, you know, if all the money went to China, in other words, to paraphrase, it's kind of

dangerous, don't you think?

The Chinese government can very quickly nationalize the businesses/profits of these powers that

be that just move their operations there.

China doesn't seem to play ball.

Yeah, that's why they don't want to go right to germ warfare because Americans own such

a big part of the Chinese economy.

It's international capital.

I see, okay.

So it really doesn't make sense to speak of countries anymore.

It's more like where is the current manufacturing and financial industry concentrated, where

it's deriving its profits from?

And currently it's not the United States.

Yeah, that was Trump's point.

The United States lost its essential power and has been living on money manipulation

since it exported its industry.

Can I read one quote from William H. Gates, his book, Showing Up for Life?

He says, "Every corner we've turned in the field of global health, we found that the

Rockefellers were already there and had been there for years.

When we committed to childhood immunization, we found ourselves building on the efforts

the Rockefeller Foundation had helped launch and fund in the 1980s, dot, dot, dot.

And we learned that such goals are not prizes claimed by the short-winded.

The Rockefellers stay with tough problems for generations."

And so this is just like we talk about, I think of you, Ray, as following in this tradition

of great scientists, you know, and William H. Gates and his son are following in the

great or the terrible shadow of these eugenicists.

And so people think or are trained to think that there's no patterns to any of this and

that it's all random and that, yeah, you shouldn't investigate these things.

Yeah.

Someone sent me a letter they had from some government official denouncing the people

who asked questions and suggested fraud.

They said that, "You aren't experts.

We aren't experts.

We have to listen to the expert opinion."

But the trouble is, who picks those experts?

Mindless crooks are defined as top scientists by the financial world.

We can move on to health stuff after this.

I did get many requests for us to talk about like the esoteric part of the elite.

And so I have on screen here the Jacob Rothschild with that, the Marina Abramovich women.

And so there's clearly some element of mysticism or like Luciferianism or religious context

for a lot of the things the elites do.

And I asked you a long time ago and you said it was more of like a window dressing thing.

But more of a window dressing?

Oh, yeah.

I think they're real philosophy.

It's worse than any of the Christian heresies or demonisms and such.

I think it's the belief that they can encode reality and that reality is computable and

controllable, basically by defining it as a quantized, digitizable something.

In other words, an absolute mentalism or idealism far beyond these little cultish ideas.

And it's a seeing of reality as lacking everything that you feel as a living part of experience.

The thing that animals and kids feel, the intrinsic fluidity of being, they believe

or assert that it is all absolutely at base, nothing but symbols and digitizable symbols.

So everything reduces to isolated quanta of existence and these ultimately are explainable

only by randomness.

So in other words, reality is fully computable, right?

Absolutely.

It started being the explicit language in the 1930s and by the 1950s it had become such

a religion that people like Norbert Wiener and Vannevar Bush, who believed in an analog

approach to cybernetics and reality in which all of the in-betweens exist and are meaningful

and controllable, not just definable quantized units.

Wiener and Bush were just written out of science.

Wiener was ostracized at MIT pretty much the way Peter Guzburg has been at California.

And meanwhile Chomsky represented the vanguard of this mentalistic, Conrad Lorentzian fascist

view of reality, claiming that you don't need an experience of language.

It could all be dealt with objectively as particles ultimately connected to genes which

are similar quantized units and you can't experience them, you can infer them.

So everything is abstract inference from symbols to symbols, eliminating all continuity and

ultimately meaning.

Chomsky was working for the Pentagon, basically financed by them, creating language schemes

that would work to give organization and instructions to troops through computers while he was posing

as an anti-imperialist, anti-militarist.

He was socializing with top people in the Pentagon, even supported a Pentagon guy as

Chancellor of MIT.

And Norbert Wiener was going into obscurity because of supporting a holistic view of cybernetics

and reality.

So do you think that some of the reasons behind this push to really restrict life and what

people are allowed to do and how they're allowed to behave and really the way their consciousness

functions, some of the reasons behind that push is because I guess they quickly realized

that computers are really powerless at emulating intelligence in its full richness and fluidity.

So they said, well, guess what?

We're just going to make people behave like computers and it will be a lot more easier

to emulate them and we're going to call it a success because the computer will be able

to emulate the human, but the human is no longer a human.

It's acting like a computer.

Exactly right.

It's all authoritarianism put into an ideology of idealism.

I just want to point out that they're standing in front of Sir Thomas Lawrence, Satan summoning

his legions.

And I thought I looked at it and it looked, I didn't know who the painting was and it

looked a little like William Blake to me and then I realized it of course wasn't in Blake's

Satan calling up his legions by Blake is about a thousand times better.

But yeah, and then we don't have to dwell on it, but the Gates implantable quantum dot

micro needle uses an enzyme called a luciferase.

And so do you think this is like a way of more of a way of control?

Like didn't Michael Aquino like the temple of set and the temple of Satan.

And so that might, if you tell a person the elite, their doctrine is to do whatever you

feel like, that's a perfect way to get people on really compromising situations.

Just the fact you can get them to submit to the treatment, everything is over then if

they submit to it, there's no need to even use the technology because they're already

victimized.

I have a question about William Blake.

In one of your articles, you said that you were teaching some students, all of you, the

class was reading the poem and then you were asking them what they thought Blake meant

and they all gave you like really bizarre answers that you thought were like, because

they were damaged by the school system and they couldn't really see what Blake really

meant.

Do you remember that occurrence and what the discussion was about?

No, I don't remember the conversation.

Lots of published critics have superficially, Blake used language.

He ironically used the language of the angels by whom he meant satanic powers, but he called

it the angels inverting things.

And a lot of critics have totally misunderstood what he was saying, totally blind to the meaning

of what he was saying and thought he was on the side of the angels who he was describing

as satanic sadists.

So what do you think he meant?

There's a famous quote, what is it?

The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.

That's a very famous quote.

What do you think he is referring to?

Is it an allegory of some sort?

Was it what?

Is it an allegory of some sort, an analogy?

No, no, just the reality is variable.

The lion is governed by appetite and the fox uses cleverness.

The lion is physically more powerful than the fox.

It might have been slightly allegorical, but he didn't have anything against foxes or cleverness.

But he did say that trickery and imposed meanings were used to enslave people.

Horses of instruction was another thing, that horses are enslaved and learn their lessons,

and that's analogous to people who are obedient and do their jobs.

Many mainstream critics seem to portray Blake as a religious fanatic, but my understanding

of him is that he was actually highly critical of traditional Christianity.

He thought that that's an image of the demons, the church and all of its structure and all

the rules that it creates.

Does that ring a bell as a true statement?

Yeah, that's his ironic language.

It was the whole meaning of much of what he wrote.

If you don't see that the angels are Satan in the sense of evil and that the devils are

the oppressed who have the potential to rebel and save some lives, like the clod and the

pebble.

The clod was a person who obediently accepts that God is in heaven and everything is okay,

and the clod gets trampled all day.

The pebble, who is tough and resistant, takes care of himself and doesn't fall for the orders

and instructions and enslavement.

So in other words, if there is truth, we will have to discover it ourselves, not to be told

by some third party, be that God or whoever else is in a position of power.

Yeah, if you have some of the pebble's toughness, you can get through the oppression.

But currently we aren't seeing many visible pebbles in the country.

That's why I thought it's kind of sad because we need pebbles in order to, the toughness

of the pebble in order to get through these trying times.

But at the same time, it seems that the health of the younger generations has been so compromised.

Things are not really looking up very good right now.

I mean, there are not many pebbles, like you said.

Speaking of variable reality, I have a question here about LSD and hallucinations.

And they say, is there a relationship between hallucinations and serotonin?

And just kind of add on to that, are the hallucinations separate from the drug's effects on the serotonin

system?

And so what are your thoughts on that, Ray?

The accumulating evidence for the first 15 or so years was very clear that LSD was a

simple anti-serotonin action.

That serotonin in overdose can make you crazy and hallucinate, but it's a misery experience,

not an enlightenment experience.

And the small amounts of LSD that will oppose serotonin on blood vessels and smooth muscles,

all of the visible systems of the body, LSD is protective against serotonin.

And the stress experience, unavoidable stress poisons you with serotonin, increases your

tendency to be obedient, to want to be controlled from the outside.

And a little bit of LSD by blocking the serotonin can open a person up, get them out of this

digitized world.

There are some interviews with Kary Mullis in which he suggests that his LSD experience

helped him break out of the insane science world and see the actual complexity.

Even looking at any sort of scientific situation, if you don't start out recognizing and assuming

the infinite complexity of things, you're going to fall for all kinds of arguments.

All of the mechanisms of science start seeming plausible to the degree that you accept the

basic idea that the world is reducible to digitized symbols.

And when you see it's a continuous, infinitely complex thing, then you can actually start

looking at the data as objective data, tremendously complex at every point.

And every point needs to be pointed in the argument.

And almost 100% of the so-called scientific literature advances without examining the

meaning of almost any of their words.

They pile one word and one mechanism on top of the other to arrive at some predetermined

goal.

And they say that's the result of their scientific investigation.

It's all essentially a kind of authoritarian religious blather.

I feel like a first-year philosophy student asking you this, but if the culture tends

to increase serotonin and serotonin influences the visual perception, are things maybe at

a certain level, when somebody takes LSD, are the things they're seeing more real than

what a person might see day to day?

Does that make any sense?

Very often they are.

It was the drug industry that caught on to the idea of promoting serotonin and tryptophan,

and they wanted to get rid of that LSD idea.

So they said that if LSD makes you insane, it's because it's blocked your serotonin,

so you have to increase your serotonin to make your mind work, emotions work properly.

But it was driven by the drug industry.

And serotonin is really primarily a stress emergency signal and hormone.

But if a person takes a large, I don't know what a large, maybe 100 micrograms of LSD

or something, and they see the world as looking like an abstract painting, is there a way

– and again, correct me if I'm wrong – but if that is more real than what I am currently

seeing right now, is there a way to mimic that to some extent, or is that just not possible

given the environment we live in?

A lot of that is the overdose effect.

In someone like Terry Mullis, they come back from it and realize how flexible the knowing

process is.

But just coffee and good health and good experience will duplicate just about everything up to

that.

I think the most important thing that the expanded consciousness does is to realize

that consciousness extends through both time and space, that you're present in the oncoming

future as well as the recent and more distant past.

The digital civilization doesn't want people to experience themselves in that way.

When you're doing that, when you're experiencing yourself extending through time and space,

you see a person's arguments and how they're mounting their argument and usually mounting

it on fraudulent assumptions and concepts.

It helps you ask the right questions, if possible, and not knock their phony structure apart.

Two questions, one related to LSD and one to consciousness.

What do you say to people who would bring up studies that show that selective serotonin

antagonists such as cyproheptadine and ketanserine can both prevent the hallucination trip from

an LSD and actually can also stop one that is already in progress?

Wouldn't that give credence to the idea that the trip from LSD is somehow connected to

the serotonin system?

I think some of the hallucination experiences come from the overdose effect of LSD starting

to act like ergot and serotonin and constricting blood vessels in the brain, shutting off energy

production and leading to distortion of perception rather than opening and amplification.

I see, but the hallucinations are really not necessary for the positive effect of the drug

to occur.

They're just more of a side effect.

Not at all.

They're a harmful side effect.

Well, many people, that's quite a revelation because many people who use LSD, I think a

significant majority of them, I would dare say, are probably using it specifically for

the trip.

They think it's what gives them this religious experience of feeling oneness with the world

and the ego dissolution.

But if I'm hearing it correctly, this is just a side effect.

They're actually the real benefits of the drug for the opposition to serotonin and even

much lower dosages would be sufficient.

There's no need to go on a trip to have this benefit.

Yeah, the range of 10 to 20 micrograms is adequate for expanding consciousness.

I see.

So, question related to consciousness.

You said that people need to understand that consciousness extends both in space and in

time.

So, would it be a useful analogy to basically imagine consciousness as, let's say, if reality

is a lake or like a body of water and we throw a stone in it, so then you have these concentric

rings of waves.

So, would it be a correct analogy to say that consciousness is the totality of those waves,

not just the place where the stone dropped?

So it's the waves that you've been making in the past and also in the future that are

converging in that central point, but the consciousness is really the totality of all

of those waves that are in the lake.

Yeah.

So, the consciousness isn't in your head.

It's never in your head if you're conscious.

Can you touch on that a little bit more?

You should not.

I think a lot of people describe like they're thinking there's like a frontal sensation

of, I don't know, presence or being, but you're saying that is not what you necessarily want

to feel or you're saying something different?

Well, feeling, feeling being is a very complex, always changing thing.

That's what one wants to do.

That actually reminded me of something else I did want to talk to you about.

I think maybe in nutrition for women, you were talking about feelings in your stomach

associated with happiness and things like maybe you call it your smile energy or something.

How much in our present environment are we cut off from these types of things and given

the specific food supply?

Do you think maybe the real human condition is much more complex than maybe what a person

experiences day to day and right now?

Yeah, your body as it approaches other beings, these feelings from your heart and solar plexus

especially, you feel a connection, the sort of thing maybe Luke Montagnier was experiencing

that when he thought of how particles interact.

But I think those are actual radiation-like experiences or processes in your organism

that are actually interacting.

When you feel that you're interacting through those nerve centers in your body, I think

you are in reality interacting.

There have been lots of experiments showing that sort of thing and that's a very functional

part of consciousness that is easily cut off.

The frown of an authority figure will cause your solar plexus or heart plexus to shrink

and wither into itself and cut you off from others.

The thing of wearing a mask and having spatial distance among other things that's making

you have a sense of withered biological interaction.

So a geometrical spacing of people through a park or building, just a horrible parody

of the digitized reality that they're imposing.

So when two people are feeling, when they say, "Oh, I'm vibing with that person,"

you're saying that there is actually a very, very objective physical process underlying

that feeling that both experience?

Yeah.

Okay.

Is it based on digestion or is it based on their consciousness somehow resonating?

Or is it, I guess, two sides of the same coin?

I think it's a physical resonance of those nerve nodes or plexuses in the body.

They are like semi-autonomous nodules.

Each one can interact in its own way, but the whole interaction of the organism comes

if you have responsive organisms and aren't interfered with by the threat of authoritarian

opinion.

Speaking of resonance, I'm sure, not sure I'm up, you've mentioned Rupert Sheldrake's

idea several times.

He talks about the morphic resonance fields and reality being essentially a superfield

composed of many subfields, consciousness being one of them.

What are these fields composed of?

Is it like ripples in the neutrino sea?

Is that what the underlying medium is?

Yeah.

Why Horace Dudley's work intrigued me.

I had been reading Andrija Puharich's things on the magic mushrooms and his organ accumulator

experiments and so on.

Puharich was believing that the autonomic nervous system was creating a vortex in some

kind of an ether that would, in a particular state, it would draw in contact with others

regardless of distance.

Michael Persinger sees it in terms of electromagnetic waves, but I prefer the Horace Dudley idea

that the neutrino sea is fundamental.

It's the subquantic medium.

So do you think Camerer's work on seriality touches upon that even though he viewed it

more abstractly?

In other words, these waves of similar events that we're seeing, they're just a physical

manifestation of those fields, of overlapping fields that Sheldrake is talking about?

Who is talking about?

Sheldrake.

So the serial events, the synchronicity that Carl Jung spoke about and Camerer actually

tried to define more scientifically, they were both essentially talking about the same

overlapping fields that Sheldrake sort of defined 100 years later more accurately.

Yeah, I think Sheldrake sometimes lapses over into a slight idealism rather than something

substantial like electromagnetic fields and neutrino sea under the fields.

Okay, so I've read some of Sheldrake's work and he talks about how a specific group of

people have a collective memory because of their similarity, whether that's physiological

or cultural or whatnot.

So let's say if a person of that, a member of that group learns something, then the rest

of the members, if they try to learn the same thing, would be easier because they will be

drawing on that sort of like field that the person has created with their own consciousness.

Why would this be limited to a specific culture or a group of people?

Why wouldn't it be a universal field that everybody contributes to?

I think it's partly the interactions that has a tuning effect.

People are embedded in the authoritarian culture which has a suppressive dividing effect and

small groups can create a somewhat private culture that gives them some freedom from

the big authoritarian process and the authoritarian larger culture, American, European, the historic

things that have gone on for thousands of years, having some common properties, assumptions,

those things suppress the biological connectedness.

But when you have a geographical interaction, I think that just like the health interactions,

when you have a certain visible people around you, that lets you tune into each other and

momentarily forget the outside interferences.

I'm sure you're familiar with the ideas of Native Americans about every person having

a totem, like a guardian animal.

But they also, apparently their culture also has this, what do you call it, myth or not,

doesn't matter, but the idea that you can actually draw on the experience of any animal

that basically that your group has associated in the past with.

So you can essentially learn, you can teach yourself to behave like a bear, live like

a bear and even see the world like a bear.

You think the lack of restrictions in those cultures are what allowing people to draw

from the collective consciousness that includes both animals and people?

Oh yeah, I think our real society includes our animal neighbors as well as our human

neighbors, often more if the animals, the birds for example, birds seem very aware when

someone is different from the pack.

They sort of hang around and wonder what's happening.

So doesn't that give a little bit of credibility to the argument that vegans would say, "Well,

we don't eat meat because we don't want to eat sentient beings."

Of course, it's a little bit duplicitous because plants are also sentient beings, so you have

to be eating something at some point.

Don't you think that the moral argument of not wanting to eat animals, doesn't that give

it a little bit of credibility because those are essentially human, they're not human,

but they're beings like us?

Of course.

When you look at food cosmically, looking at the nature of cosmic energy produced by

fusion, presumably, or whatever it is that makes solar stellar energy flowing through

substances, the process of nutrition, you should see it in that cosmic dimension.

It happens that the safest nutrition for long life and clear consciousness, unstressed consciousness,

happens to be fruit and milk.

The milk purifies nutrients and rebalances them in an anti-stress way.

With a selection of fruits, the fruit is designed to nourish its seeds or to feed an animal

that will distribute the seeds, so the seeds would be unethical to eat and the body of

the fruit would be an absolute positive thing in the cosmic flow of energy.

What about eggs?

Would eggs be okay in that framework of thought?

Less ideal, but still no sentient process has developed.

That reminds me of, I think somebody wrote you a long time ago, and I think they were

contemplating suicide or something, and you wrote them something to the effect of, "You

have to realize there's lots of intelligence left in the world.

It's just not human intelligence."

Something to that effect.

Okay, let's take a mild break here, guys.

We have, I don't know how many people are watching this at the moment, but give this

episode a like.

Huge thank you to Ray, huge thank you to Georgie.

These episodes are always super special, so I appreciate it.

Ray, can you just let everybody know how to order your newsletter?

Oh, email raypeachnewsletter@gmail.com.

And then I just got the novel flu one a few weeks ago, and so yeah, you're sending those

out via email.

I get that question all the time.

Unless you had any more big questions, I guess we could go through some logistical supplement

food-related questions, Georgie.

You mean the questions about PUFA and life of fishing?

Yeah.

So, Ray, I don't know.

I think there's a secondhand quote from somebody else, but maybe you said something to the

effect of, "By the time a person is 30, they have enough PUFA to last a lifetime."

One, is that accurate?

And then two, what does that mean in the grand scheme of things?

It's even more important to keep the total polyunsaturated fat pretty low, right?

I don't think I understood the question.

I guess, so, okay, just this statement.

By the time a person is 30, they have as much polyunsaturated fat in their tissue to last

a lifetime.

So, it's...

That seems to presume that there's some use for polyunsaturated fat.

I see them as harmful right from the start.

Well-fed, healthy mother, when they analyze a newborn's brain, the conventional science

says they're all born with a PUFA deficiency, an essential fatty acid deficiency.

No, that's the healthy, very high metabolizing brain that has been protected against PUFA

by the placenta.

But as soon as breath-feeding stops or if they start using a formula that has added

PUFA, the brain starts assimilating it, forming esters of cholesterol that accumulate, ultimately

causing atherosclerosis, but accumulating in the brain and other tissues, slowing metabolism

so that constantly, as exactly as the cholesterol ester content of PUFA increases, the metabolic

rate decreases.

And that, it simply, by the age of 30 or 40, it's reaching the point that it is causing

aging symptoms to set in, and it progresses with the onset of a cold brain, Alzheimer's

disease and dementia.

The cholesterol ester content of the brain is becoming extreme and blocking metabolism

progressively.

You're right.

It's like a positive thing, I have the question, but I appreciate your answer.

That makes sense.

I have a question.

So let's say somebody's, I read a study that said that when you're eating a combination

of fats, the saturated fat gets preferentially oxidized while the PUFA gets preferentially

stored in the fatty tissue.

Doesn't that sort of imply that it would be really, really difficult to change your fatty

acid composition through diet?

Because every time, unless you're eating almost 100% saturated fat diet...

Under stress, the PUFA comes out preferentially and it increases in the fat cells with aging,

but that just means that when you're under stress and you're releasing free fatty acids,

they become more toxic the older you get because you have more of them in the system.

But they're also in the phospholipids and cholesterol esters, not just in the storage

fats.

In terms of displacing that PUFA or increasing the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the

tissues, I think there seems to be more, I don't want to call it more optimal, but the

longer chain saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid, stearic acid, anything over the carbon

chain length of 14 seems to be better because these get preferentially absorbed through

the lymphatic system and they can get to the tissues, while the shorter chain fatty acids

like those found in coconut oil seem to be quickly picked up by the portal vein system

and get into the liver and the liver oxidizes it.

So if somebody wants to change their tissue composition, they need to be eating longer

chain saturated fatty acids.

Am I reading this right?

Yeah, there are quite a few studies showing a longer life in proportion to the percentage

of highly saturated, completely saturated fats and inverse cancer incidence.

And do you remember the old vitamin E people were finding that the crude vitamin E had

a stamina increasing effect, but it turned out when they refined it a little more, it

was the very long chain saturated fats that were providing the protective athletic endurance

and stamina increasing effect of wasn't the vitamin E, but the waxing material associated

with it.

And since refining vitamin E has eliminated those waxy, highly saturated long chain fats,

the studies of vitamin E are no longer so positive.

Yeah, you mean the polycarcinols, the ones that the Cubans are running studies with for

cardiovascular disease?

Yeah.

So yeah, I remember, yeah.

Those studies seem to abruptly stop around the late forties, the ones that talked about

the wheat germ oil, the stamina effect of wheat germ oil, and then they purified it.

They found out it's the long chain fats, the fatty acid alcohols.

And then the Cubans started doing some research with those.

And I feel like as soon as the Cubans picked up on that, because they're extracting them

from sugar cane, then a whole slew of studies came out in the United States and actually

in the general Western medical press saying, this is a complete scam.

These things do not work.

This is communist science.

You know, but it seems like this is so strange because the original science happened in the

United States.

It was just before the 1950s.

Yeah.

Science is all about marketing.

You just shouldn't believe 98% of the things published as science.

Everything except some cosmology and some physics, everything else tends to be marketing.

Okay.

So would you say that these extremely long chain fatty acids, like the polycarcinols

are actually better at displacing the PUFA in the tissues?

I think so.

Okay.

Do you have like a recommendation of someone, because they actually, they sell this, assuming

someone can get it as a pure powder or supplement.

Most of the Cuban studies say just 10 to 20 milligrams a day is enough.

And that seems to be what all those studies with the unrefined vitamin E, that seems to

be what a daily intake would provide.

Do you have any recommendation on specific dosages?

I think that's about the right quantity.

Okay.

Understood.

Ray, the ketone gut?

Well, related to the lipophosgene, but I guess you can ask about the ketone.

I just wanted to go over the ketone body ratio again, because I think that is, I think the

very dominant alt paradigm right now is keto, fasting, low carb, carnivore diets.

And some of the big proponents in that camp and camps similar, they talk about that fasting

and ketosis increase NAD relative to NADH.

And given the ketone body ratio, it seems like, and they'll quote these two papers,

I should have wrote them down, but that seems impossible given the limited amount of investigation

I've done on the ketone body ratio.

It's like so clear that any gut...

All of the best biochemists that I know of showed that diabetes and fasting caused extreme

reduction of NADH rather than NAD, a shift towards the cancer physiology.

Is that happening in every system equally?

Like do different systems compensate when the stress first starts to appear or something?

I think very bad biochemical technique always messes up the reduction balance analysis.

Glutathione and NADH are so sensitive to conditions that I think in the last 30 years or so, most

of the work published is doctrine rather than fact.

I have a little bit of clarification on that.

I think most of these papers are measuring the NAD to the NADH ratio in the cytosol.

And in the cancer cell, you actually, in the diabetic cell, the NAD to the NADH ratio in

the cytosol of these six cells is actually very high because those cells are using pyruvate

as an emergency oxidant and they're generating lactate.

But the mitochondrial ratio of NAD to the NADH is actually very low in cancer, diabetes

and fasting.

So I would like to see those papers, where did they measure that ratio?

Because even the Wikipedia page on the Randle cycle talks about fatty acid oxidation dramatically

shifting the redox balance towards reduction in the mitochondria.

So that seems to be already sort of like commonly accepted knowledge.

And some of the ketones so-called are not ketones.

The beta-hydroxybutyrate, they call that a ketone body, but it's not a ketone.

And it shifts cell balance the same way lactic acid does.

It's a reductant.

And I know you've gone over this a hundred thousand times, but when somebody does benefit

from a ketosis style of diet, you hypothesize maybe that it's disinfecting their intestine

possibly to some way and maybe they're changing their food, just better quality in general.

Yeah.

Someone who has been eating pasta and sweet potatoes and so on, if they shift to a meat

and egg and cheese diet, their intestine is going to be very happy.

And for a couple of years, they all feel great.

Exactly.

And just to piggyback on that, the parathyroid calcium to phosphorus, that's a moment to

moment thing, correct?

Like if you eat a meal that is higher in phosphorus, that could turn on your parathyroid hormone

for the next few hours.

Is that right?

I think so.

And it's a very good indicator of stress.

And the whole system that turns on aldosterone, angiotensin, renin, aldosterone, that's behind

the process of increasing your parathyroid hormone.

And so many kinds of stress will do it, but it happens that high phosphate is very closely

connected calcium and vitamin D are connected in the other way, protecting against all of

those pro-inflammatory anti-metabolic things.

So a high calcium diet with vitamin D seems to energize your thyroid function because

it's getting you out of that parathyroid hormone, aldosterone, angiotensin, inflammatory reductive

state.

And you know, vitamin D, I'm sure you're aware there are plenty of studies that try to portray

in a bad light.

And some of the older studies show that if you administer high doses of vitamin D, even

in the absence of increased calcium intake in the diet, apparently it can cause soft

tissue calcification.

Do you think there's any truth to those studies or do you think vitamin D needs a cofactor

to make it work more safely, like maybe vitamin K?

A lot of them are confusing 125-hydroxycholicalciferol with the 25-hydroxy and the literature is

dominated by that confusion.

And if you start with cloth-O, the anti-aging protein, you'll see that 25-hydroxy supports

cloth-O and 125, the so-called active vitamin D, knocks down cloth-O and raises parathyroid

hormone and angiotensin.

All of the toxi-degenerative things is done by the activated vitamin D and there's a very

massive confusion on that.

I'm talking about active vitamin D as if it's the relevant thing rather than being evidence

of extreme stress and sickness.

But the 25-hydroxy in the body, I think in the kidney or in the liver, it gets converted

into 125-hydroxy, right?

So wouldn't taking a precursor like that raise the risk?

No, no.

It lowers it in fact.

Oh, wow.

So if you put calcium where it belongs, it will, eating calcium and vitamin D will lower

parathyroid hormone and lower inflammation and raise cloth-O and pretty much turn off

the activation in the kidneys, which happens in end-stage kidney disease, for example.

Okay.

The activation goes wild and kills a person.

What about the potential risk for hypercalcemia with high doses of vitamin D?

Do you think that's still tied to that confusion about calcitriol versus cholecalciferol?

I think so.

The studies I've seen with very big doses of 25-hydroxy show no harm at all up to a

million units or something for an extended period.

Just a clarification, I know you've also talked about this before, but cortisol is

made from progesterone but doesn't increase it.

And so when people look at those steroid synthesis charts, I think it's very confusing.

And so is there an easy way of a layman grappling with the fact that when you take progesterone,

it's not going to increase your cortisol levels?

Yes.

Think of the connections as being like a rope.

If there's a deficiency, there's weight on the rope, it'll pull the precursor along.

No matter how much pressure you put on your end of the rope, you can't push the other

end of the rope.

Those charts have to be thought of holistically and there's no pushing allowed, it's all

pulling.

That's interesting.

And then last question for me, the progesterone DHEA ratio.

And so you and I, I don't know, maybe two years ago or something, I was asking you about

an amount of DHEA to use with a progesterone specifically for male and we had a back and

forth.

But you don't think that they have to be used in some specific ratio all the time?

That was, I don't know, you want to talk?

Yeah.

If someone is going to blindly use it, it would be a good idea just to have a ballpark

somewhere in the ratio that you can't poison yourself with DHEA and you can't suppress

your nervous system so much that you don't make any.

But a lot of people find that they increase their DHEA and testosterone just by taking

progesterone because progesterone turns off aromatase, for example.

Aromatase tends to waste DHEA and testosterone by grinding it through the estrogen process.

So wouldn't basically this be a statement in favor of using DHEA with some progesterone

to lower the risk of it converting into estrogen in a, let's say, hypothyroid person?

No, if you don't have any DHEA being produced, it's good to have some in your body.

So it's very often helpful all the way up for a very old person at 10 or 12 milligrams

per day backed up with progesterone can be curative, can bring back tissue, connective

tissue strength and so on.

Both progesterone and DHEA in a really old person can have very powerful restorative

effects but in a younger person, often the body doesn't have any problem making DHEA

and the progesterone will just help activate the thyroid and reduce the aromatase and inflammatory

processes.

Well, I guess my question was if someone were to take DHEA, it would be safer if they combine

it with progesterone, wouldn't you say so?

Yeah, because so many people take more DHEA than they really can use in the proper ways

and so a 30-year-old taking 10 milligrams is very likely to be producing too much estrogen

from it if they happen to be slightly hypothyroid or deficient in vitamin D or under stress

of some sort.

Okay.

I have a question about pregnenolone.

In one of your articles in several interviews, you mentioned an old study where they fed

rats the human equivalent of a cup a day and I've been trying to find that study and you

said that pregnenolone essentially lowered their cortisol back to normal.

Do you remember what year that study was or where it was published or where you saw it

because I couldn't find it?

Yeah, I saw it in a book published I think 1950 edited by Abraham White.

Okay.

I mean, Ray, getting some of your references is like an investigation of many months.

I know you provide a significant amount but sometimes you'll mention something and it

will literally take me like a year to find eventually.

Without Sci-Hub, I wouldn't be able to find anything.

Are you familiar with that, Ray?

Without what?

Sci-Hub, S-C-I-H-U-B, basically the pirate website to download articles.

Oh, okay.

Well, anyways, that's like a huge boon to I think anybody with an active interest in

this field but yeah, anyways, it's very fun tracking down some of the things you mentioned,

finding them in old books and such.

Let me read through these super chats and then we can wrap this up.

Linda Bell for $5, thank you so much.

She says good evening.

Lisa Ferraro for $9.99.

Thank you, Lisa.

Linda, Lisa says, I love these conversations between Ray, Georgie, and Danny.

Thank you guys.

Please keep having them.

Thanks for that, Lisa.

Pure Therapy for $4.99 and he has a dancing GIF emoji.

Thanks for that, Pure Therapy.

Tone, we won't be able to get to questions here because I'd feel bad because we never

answer questions on here.

For $20 though, thank you, Tone.

Sincerely appreciate it.

Harry Burgos for $25.

Thank you, Harry.

And Machel for $50.

Wow, that's a lot.

And he says, let's not be trodden with cattle's feet, go pebbles.

Thank you for that, Machel.

I sincerely appreciate it.

And I'll forward these directly to Ray.

Georgie, you have any final questions for Ray?

One last question on lipofuscin.

Yes.

Go for it.

So we talked about PUFA accumulation with age and let's say like eating longer chain

saturated fatty acids can over time displace it.

But would that take care of lipofuscin, Ray?

Because my impression from the studies that I've been reading is that once it forms inside

the cell, you'll have to take some kind of a solvent.

And there's some studies on potentially vitamin E or even alcohol.

Drinking alcohol can potentially help with that.

Yeah, that was interesting.

They were in nerve cells, they were studying vitamin E's ability to disintegrate lipofuscin

and they were dissolving the vitamin E in ethanol.

So they tested plain ethanol and it worked just almost as well as the vitamin E with

ethanol.

And that got me interested in its antioxidant action.

It takes something like a teaspoonful of ethanol per day to have a very powerful antioxidant

effect.

I learned that in physics and some very sensitive engineering where they are using transistors

and such need to be free radicals.

Just a tiny amount of ethanol vapor is a powerful anti-free radical agent.

So would those be the safest things for potentially dissolving lipofuscin until more is known?

I mean, a tiny bit of ethanol, maybe like one drink a day?

Years ago I saw people who had a fried appearance from so much age pigment and taking progesterone

within a few weeks their skin looked restored and normal.

So I think if you turn off estrogen very efficiently, you stop making it and your body can clear

it up.

That person that I first saw it happen was in her 40s and I think there's still enough

good thyroid metabolism going that progesterone could be the catalyst suppressing estrogen

and shifting the balance away from formation towards elimination.

Understood.

One final question.

What is your general opinion of the steroidal, and I emphasize steroidal, aromatase inhibitors?

Do they have any place in any kind of like a compromised health condition or do you think

progesterone can offer everything they could and do that more safely?

They have side effects and I don't think there's been a great effort to explore why those side

effects happen.

And so I think maybe in 20 years more will be known, but I think they're good to avoid

and use any of the known very effective anti-aromatase.

Even the angiotensin receptor blockers are pretty effective.

Lots of things inhibit aromatase, anything that stops the basic inflammatory oxygen deprivation

process.

Okay.

Final question.

In one of your recent emails with a person, they forwarded to me, you spoke about eugenol

and of its potentially, it's like a great spectrum of beneficial effects.

And I looked at the molecule and it reminds me a lot of dopamine.

Do you think eugenol has some of those effects on the nervous system, kind of pro-dopamine,

anti-serotonin?

Oh, I don't know.

There are some good effects seen with it, but I haven't used enough to really have an

opinion.

Okay.

All right.

That's it.

I don't have anything else.

Ray, what are you working on right now?

I'm thinking about how education is going to be affected by the takeover lockdown mentality

with people like Governor Cuomo putting Eric Schmidt to work at converting from real education

to digital education.

I think some thought needs to be given to how actual real living education might be

protected against this authoritarian pseudo using digital systems to apply indoctrination

and call it education.

There were a few requests for us to talk about Jonathan Taylor Gatta.

I'm sorry, I screwed up the name.

But maybe we can save that for next time because that is a huge topic.

So I'm glad you brought it up.

Ray, do you have any party words for everybody?

I think 150 or so people are listening right now.

Nope.

Awesome.

Ray, thank you so much.

These are always fun to do.

Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much.

And we'll be back next month.

Thank you guys for watching.

I have an amazing audience.

We're very fortunate.

So thank you guys so much and have a safe weekend and we'll talk to you soon.What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack?

That we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?

I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished by the present.

Victor Technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this year, may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

Piloting the space shuttle is very difficult to do, one would think. Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits. In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk, can take smoke and waters, and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

[Music]

Change. Okay, Georgi Dinkov, Raymond Peat, we're talking about borders.

Ray, do you want to back up a little bit and just maybe rehash the first part of that conversation?

Because that was pretty interesting.

I think you mentioned that some federal police, other than the National Guard, were involved in the Portland violence.

The reporters were aware of the police violence, and so they got organized and were keeping careful watch on what the police were doing.

So the police were arresting reporters. The mayor got involved and got gassed. So the local police themselves were involved.

But the Homeland Security was probably doing some of the nastiest stuff.

The Border Patrol has no limits on their authority. They can go into your house and search your person, do anything they want without a warrant.

And that applies to everyone within 100 miles of any border. That means Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Canada, and Mexico.

And includes about two-thirds of the U.S. population. And most of the major cities are within 100 miles of the border.

So their jurisdiction has just been expanded. But it seems like the – I remember the Boston bombing, when they were just strolling down the streets and entering people's houses.

Do they even have to have a special task force to even do that kind of thing? It seems like they can do whatever they want.

They do it anyway, but it just happens that the Border Patrol, the real people working at the borders, can follow you and open your car and documents and take your equipment or whatever they want to do, as long as they're within 100 miles of the border.

But technically it applies all the time to everyone within that massive amount of territory.

I remember during the Boston bombings, they invoked something called exigent circumstances to be able to go into people's houses and search for these two bombers.

And then apparently under the official rules, they're not supposed to – if they find something illegal during that search, because it's executed without a warrant, they're technically looking for these two bad people.

If they find you doing something illegal, like growing weed in your basement or anything similar to that, it's not supposed to be admissible in court and they're not supposed to be using it to prosecute people.

Guess what happened two weeks after the Boston bombers got caught? 47 people got indicted for growing weed, having ecstasy, small amount of pills on their property and things like that.

And all of that was obtained during those searches under exigent circumstances.

And when the lawyers said, "This is not admissible, you're not supposed to be using it," the government said, "Oh no, we're invoking national security so everything's classified and these people are convicted, but you cannot know why and what the reason is."

So they very much abused the law any way they want, it seems.

They are convicting on the basis of secret evidence, having secret laws, keeping essential documents secret forever, especially when they would incriminate huge numbers of people.

When you were dealing with Blake College in Mexico and you were coming back into the States, were you ever harassed by Border Patrol for political reasons?

Yeah, I was very careful not to have any botanical matter stuck to my clothes or anything.

But they would do things like, once I was bringing a little clay flute and they scraped it to see if it was solidified cocaine or something and pried the heels off my shoes to see if...

Ray, does contact tracing just send chills down your spine?

Oh, no more than the usual awareness of what they're doing without calling it anything special.

What is contact tracing?

The infected people getting near someone else, they can follow all of the interacting chains of more or less direct social contacts.

Wow. But that requires those people somehow cooperating, right? You have to install something on your phone or do you think they're tagging people somehow biologically at this point?

No, if they have a cell phone, they trace them by that. Get the phone company records to find their location. Mostly it's going through cell phone tracing, I think.

Do you think the government is interested in biological tagging?

Eventually they'll get to that.

I have a view of the future of people being called by contact tracers and talking about a barbecue they went to last week. That sounds pretty miserable.

Yeah, having a big babysitter like that.

Ray, since we last chatted, is there something before we dive into it, is there anything that you feel like is specifically developed over the last month that should be a central idea?

Maybe vaccination, because we're just thrusting towards that point where I imagine that will be another milestone of this hysteria of whenever that comes out.

In preparation for that, I was reading a little bit about pandemrix and I wasn't sure if you had any thoughts on that whole fiasco.

There was a huge epidemic of narcolepsy in Finland immediately after a vaccination campaign. I imagine that's one of the bases of action against the maker of that particular vaccine.

There were several other countries that had epidemics of narcolepsy, but not as big as Finland.

I think one of the things that needs to be done is to get information on the people who were vaccinated for influenza last year in that huge campaign of getting especially old people.

That would include everyone in the rest homes and convalescent homes, so they would be 100% vaccinated for flu last year.

I've seen all of the studies done on the follow-up, looking for the effect of flu vaccines on the following year's incidence of influenza.

They managed to find a way to claim a certain amount of prevention of flu using very odd methods, very special for looking at the efficacy of flu vaccine.

But something that came out in all of those studies was a very big increase in the incidence of other respiratory infections.

Even though they saw a slight decrease in flu, there was a great increase in coronavirus infections.

Just looking at those published papers, you would assume that the great mortality from coronavirus was undoubtedly increased by the fact that they were probably 100% vaccinated for flu just a few months earlier.

If you look at immune activation on PubMed, you'll find lots of studies of the damaging effects of basically any kind of immune activation, meaning activating an inflammatory process.

If it happens during pregnancy, such as either a bacterial or viral infection occurring naturally or a flu vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant in it,

any activation of the immune system during pregnancy has very great long-term, lifelong effects on the fetus.

The next generation will have depression and all kinds of after effects.

Cognition is one of the major themes of the degree of immune activation.

The number of pathogens you've been exposed to corresponds negatively to mandibility.

Have you seen people with the Gulf War Syndrome, Ray? When they give interviews, they look like they're about to fall asleep and many of them suffer from narcolepsy.

Do you think serotonin is somehow involved in that symptomatology?

Oh, yeah. Whatever they were exposed to, including 20 vaccines, I think at least, just to go there.

Ray, what can we learn from the H1N1? Do you think that was a failed attempt to do what they're doing now?

Maybe 10 years ago, not as many things were put into place like they are now.

For example, Gates is intertwined with not only the vaccines, but also the identification and the contact tracing.

Clearly, there's a big spider web of things that had to be in place before something of this magnitude could be employed and set up so thoroughly.

That's possible. Are you familiar with the 1976 outbreak, swine flu?

At the time, I think the propaganda was that they had identified it as the same as the 1918 influenza outbreak that killed supposedly 50 to 100 million people around the world.

In 1918, people had no idea what the cause of influenza was. They thought it was bacterial.

On the basis of finding a few frozen corpses and finding this coronavirus or flu virus in them, I think it was H1N1, they declared that that was the cause of the 1918 epidemic.

The science of the 1918 pandemic was even worse than the present science.

The man in charge of evaluating influenza vaccines in 1976 was telling his bosses that the vaccines were going to cause more harm than good

because the virus always mutates ahead of any vaccine.

He went public with his information that there was no safety data and lots of harm documented.

So he got fired and they went ahead with the production of the vaccines, killed a lot of people, paralyzed hundreds, and paid off a large amount of money to the injured or killed people.

But there never was an H1N1 or swine flu epidemic at all in the United States in 1976.

Have you seen the recent study that came out about 5G electromagnetic fields potentially capable of inducing the organism to synthesize the coronavirus de novo without any external infection?

That would be in line with Montagnier's experiments with the virus acting as an antenna and transmitter.

Exactly. And the study that just came out is by five, I think three of them are physicists, two of them are doctors, they're all Italians from the Galermo Marconi University, I believe in Italy, which is a fairly legitimate institute of higher education.

And it seems to be peer reviewed and published and they described the exact same mechanism that because the 5G electromagnetic waves are of such a short wavelength, they can actually get inside cells and the cells can act as antennas and then the DNA can act as an inductor.

And then because when the body is exposed to these 5G fields, the movement that these waves induce in the DNA is causing certain gaps to appear in the cell.

And apparently the cell is trying to plug that, so to speak, and it's producing RNA that is indistinguishable from the RNA of the coronavirus.

At least that's what the study claims.

Does it sound feasible or even possible or do you think it's far-fetched?

When I was taking developmental biology, someone accidentally put in a publication from around 1940 in which they were exposing cells to foreign protein and then reproducing in culture several generations of the exposed cells.

And finding that it was emitting copies of the protein that had been exposed to, that was a perfect demonstration that a cell can perceive a very different molecule that it presumably could not possibly have DNA for.

And after exposure and multiplication, several, I think, 10 or more generations of cell division, it was still producing very measurable amounts of this foreign protein.

So that indicated that cells have an apparatus for copying a protein, transforming the information from the sequence of the protein into a sequence of DNA or RNA, and then reading out endless copies of a protein indistinguishable from the one it was exposed to.

And I commented on that paper and then it disappeared from the file and I hadn't made notes on it.

So I think it disappeared from the whole library because someone had accidentally included it.

So under the same principle, we could be producing HIV endogenously, right?

Yeah, that's Montagnier's argument on why he's banned and went to China to work.

Okay.

So that seems especially prudent to point out what's fit for the peons is not fit for the government employees.

And so they're going to get the unadjuvated vaccine.

And I imagine something similar will happen for whatever is released for coronavirus.

Much less harmful and almost totally ineffective.

Well, another thing I wanted to bounce off you.

Apparently, this pandemic went through a series of tests that were like, well, not we're, but whoever's producing the Moderna or whatever is not even going to do.

And so in your estimation, how much more dangerous is something released for coronavirus going to be than even this narcolepsy inducing and demers?

This will be the first RNA vaccine.

And I think the people who are talking about it and making it are probably totally unaware that our cells have lots and lots of reverse transcriptases.

And so we're just waiting for a bit of foreign RNA to come in to make copies and send it into our genome as permanent DNA.

And then our great, great grand descendants will be able to make the most toxic spike protein part of the virus in uncontrolled quantities.

And we're going to be able to multiply it to produce immunity to it.

And we're going to be able to produce the same thing and in itself, the whole story of the spike protein and what it does,

is the key to making the virus infectious for humans, which all of the studies of the last 10 or 15 years have been working on perfecting that spike protein.

And so it fits a human ACE2 enzyme. ACE2 is the enzyme that detoxifies androtensin,

destroys our basic inflammation and blood pressure, raising peptide.

And so the danger of having a lot of coronavirus is simply that it creates inflammation by knocking out our intrinsic defense against androtensin.

And that fact has been covered up or ignored or put into some way of thinking about the idea that the virus and its replication create the disease somehow.

So the disease will be centered where you find the virus, which is the lungs and the intestine.

But it also turns out to be the heart and the gonads and lots of other tissues.

But the intestine and the respiratory membranes are actually major sites of viral replication.

So they say inflammation of the lungs is what you have to think about.

But when you knock out ACE2, you're creating systemic inflammation and inflammation of the bowel creates systemic inflammation.

So the whole thing is the turning on of the androtensin system.

And if the spike protein can't undergo a series of confirmation changes,

it can't create the confirmation that makes the perfect receptor binding site and the spike protein doesn't work, the virus isn't infective.

And I found a recent publication, C. Toelzer et al., T-O-E-L-Z-E-R,

showing that the final step in forming the active binding site of the spike protein requires the binding of linoleic acid,

which it finds on the cell surface if the person has been eating their vegetable oil regularly.

The more linoleic acid you have floating around in your system,

the more likely the virus is to be activated and successful in sticking to you and causing inflammation.

And that has only been published in abstract form so far.

I'm afraid it isn't going to make it much farther because of its implications for nutrition.

Ray, if you were an evil maniac working in a lab, is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system something to target to produce incredibly negative effects in a wide variety of people?

Yeah. It exists in everyone and every cell. They used to think it was a matter of the liver and kidney interacting, renin and so on.

But mast cells in any tissue can make renin and then local converting enzymes can convert the renin into the series of angiotensin peptides.

So it's a local inflammation promoter. Anywhere you have a mast cell or any other basic defense immune-related enzymes,

it's a universal thing, more basic than nitric oxide and estrogen, serotonin, for example.

It closely relates to those and turns them on. It's an activator of aromatase, for example.

So it activates this explosion of all kinds of inflammation promoters, cytokines and so on.

And so if you can knock out the enzyme that destroys that, you've created with the least effort the most destruction.

I have a question. If, let's say, the body is exposed to these foreign DNA/RNA from viruses or vaccines and it internalizes them as part of the DNA,

and then we know that under stress the body starts shedding the retroviruses into the bloodstream,

does it do so haphazardly or does it pick out specific things that it has internalized to start deploying into the bloodstream?

Or is it simply just a random reaction to stress, just dumps whatever it has?

I think it's regulated by a very ultra-organized system, that antenna we were talking about.

There is a website called Cell Intelligence, what's his name, Albrecht Buehler,

a very good website in which he gives his argument that the cell knows how to call up exactly the genes it wants

by such things as the antigen that it's exposed to.

The cell has a reading system like a super librarian that knows where to find everything specifically.

The normal use of the system that reads out retroviruses is, I'm sure it's the same system that produces the exosomes,

which are part of a repair and maintenance system that replicates RNA and DNA and proteins as needed,

forming these particles that are almost under a microscope indistinguishable from the coronavirus and other viruses

and manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted in the same way into the bloodstream.

For example, if you have injured lung tissue that needs repair, it composes by drawing out just the RNA,

DNA and proteins that are needed for repair to compose exosomes, which it puts into the bloodstream

and they travel to the bone marrow where they're picked up by the cells that are more or less stem cells

waiting for a call for help. They are taken up and processed the same way a vaccine will be processed.

These exosomes, virus-like particles are taken up by the bone marrow cells, causing bone marrow cells to differentiate

into a pre-lung cell, not quite a stem cell, but a stem cell differentiating towards becoming a lung cell

and are then excreted back into the whole cell, leaves the marrow and enters the bloodstream.

Because it's already on the pathway to becoming lung tissue, it is recognized and sticks to the region

where it's needed as repair. It's like a repair lung tissue that has wandered away, so it sticks when it gets

where it's needed and does its job of repairing the injury. It's a very powerful, specific,

intra-body communication system between stem cells and injured cells.

So basically, these viruses that we're internalizing are like tissue-specific alarm signals that can be

called upon for help when needed?

Yes. Random stuff getting added to that system is going to have the potential to change our course of development.

Do you know if there's any fixed capacity, but is there any limit on the amount of external DNA, RNA,

information material that the body can internalize?

Any kind of what DNA?

Is there any limit to the storage or the capacity of the storage of the body for external information?

I think the body probably has various filters, but a lab in Germany has published many papers showing that the

DNA in our foods can be found in our cells. So there is quite a bit of uptake even from our foods.

Autopsies on women who have had two or three husbands have demonstrated DNA from husbands one and two,

as well as the most recent one in her tissues, including brain tissue.

So she's putting away and storing the semen DNA.

Probably those are useful because there are cases where, for example, a white man going into a totally black part of

Africa 50 or 60 years ago and having kids, a picture of his kids were progressively lighter.

Each baby got paler as the woman accumulated his DNA.

Is that the principle that explains telegony, do you think?

I think it's similar to xenia and specifically I think it would be telegony.

I was going to change topics, so interrupt me, Georgi, but right. We some of the criticisms of these conversations is that

we kind of jumped off into things a thousand miles per hour of the so-called conspiracy things that we talk about.

So maybe. Well, number one, can you even separate health and food and nutrition from a deteriorating environment?

And then number two, maybe like I imagine you're like consciousness of the powers that be.

That was before the Internet. And some people were curious, like, how did you even learn these things?

Because, I mean, that would be interesting in general.

How did I learn which things? Beyond biology or political?

I mean, investigating the powers that be, the DuPonts, the Morgans, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.

How did you come to learn what was really going on? You called your parents co-conspirators a while ago.

Was that information they had already figured out?

And I mean, so I think about the Internet and how it was integral for me learning about 9/11 or UFOs or whatever,

and that opening up me to different possibilities. But I imagine that would be very difficult without the Internet.

But maybe I'm just short, short sighted.

Oh, up until right after the World War II, people used to talk a lot.

And a lot of it was personal experience.

And there was a lot of mimeographed underground stuff going around, very small numbers.

And people who were curious could get a fairly good picture of what the government was doing in medicine, for example.

It never got in the newspapers, but it could be documented later.

And once you find a library that has been careless about censorship,

when I first went to the University of Oregon in 1956, I went as an English major,

but I found anthropology and biology stuff a lot more interesting.

So I read lots in those areas. And 10 years later, I went back to the library looking for those books.

None of the most interesting ones were there anymore.

And they had opened a bookstore in the basement selling unwanted books for a nickel or a dime.

I know you talk about this in your "How do we know" newsletter of a person, their consciousness changing as their structure changes.

Do you think something we've heard is that you guys should really just stick to talking about nutrition?

Do you think you can talk about health without addressing these, like kind of investigating these things?

Or are they mutually exclusive? Or what do you think?

Health involves interaction with the environment, air, food, and information, and the medical system, and the various sources of poisoning.

And so you immediately start, as soon as you think about a symptom and what doctors do about it,

immediately you're involved in politics.

And then when you start investigating any little part, either political or historical or biological, whatever,

you find that that leads into more and more expansive implications.

It takes years and years to put together a fairly general picture, but it starts with the suspicion that things aren't what they're said to be in the regular newspapers, radio, and television.

Like in 1945, on the radio, Harry Truman said, "We have just dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a military base."

And I started thinking about that and tried to find out more about it, and then it turned out Hiroshima was a big city.

And then later, every anniversary, they would repeat Truman's announcement, but that phrase was deleted, just neatly clipped out and the tape joined together.

And I started doubting and looking for background information every time Eisenhower would talk.

I would see if there were alternative opinions and objections, and I started seeing what an immense web of corruption Eisenhower was involved in.

Money flowing from the oil industry, hydroelectric industry, all very big industries were funneling money to him to buy his support for their policies.

Senator Wayne Morse was someone who started investigating that sort of corruption.

Around the same time, Senator Estes Kefauver did the investigation of the drug industry, and he was by far the most popular presidential candidate.

But the party did the usual thing and elected a right-wing, middle-of-the-roader, two-time unsuccessful candidate to keep out anyone who was really interested in starting to investigate

what the government was really about.

The manipulator's ability to memory hole information is astounding to me.

Every event will have a series of anomalies, but they are totally eliminated within a few days or a few weeks, and then the narrative is crafted, it's cemented in Wikipedia, and nobody ever thinks about it again.

So it's pretty – I mean just living through that in real time, and you have a way broader sense of that than I do.

You have to document the validity of the documents themselves because those are very often forged.

Just destroying them is the first thing, but they have done lots of very convincing forgeries.

When the documents are sealed, during that keeping them from the public, you can be sure that there are people working on expunging the most incriminating material.

Documents aren't safe anywhere in the government, so you have to look critically at even the documents that should be the last word.

You have to look for eyewitnesses, people who lived through it and can tell the story.

When you see several people who had similar experiences, didn't know each other but had exactly the same sort of experience,

then you can start to form an opinion about what really happened.

Almost all of 20th century history as far as it regards Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union is based on forgeries as far as American historians are concerned.

I would love to get into that. One other question. I was just watching John Oliver, who has replaced The Daily Show.

A lot of people really go to that show for information. It's a comedy/political show.

He just did one on conspiracy theory, so-called. His dominant point, as I'm sure you've heard hundreds of times, is nobody can keep a secret.

When reading Fletcher Prouty's The Secret Team, he goes into great length talking about compartmentalization.

The whole setup of the CIA is keeping secrets. Why do you think that's something that's so commonly misunderstood?

Obviously, these intelligence apparatuses could not function if they had the inability to keep information secret.

Yes, the mass media can keep, even when the secret is out and 100 or 500 people know it,

the mass media can keep everyone else, everyone that counts, from knowing it.

Just this last week, someone I had lost touch with for 55 years heard me on one of these talk programs and got in touch.

We're starting to put together experiences from things related to the government shutting down Blake College.

He was there through the whole thing and experienced a lot of things that I didn't have any perspective on at all.

We're going to put together a new picture that neither of us could have formed independently.

If we could get in touch with other people who had gone through that experience,

then we could start to put together a historical picture. He's Luis Urias, who was an associate of Alejandro Hodorowski, who made the movies.

Holy Mountain.

What was that?

The Holy Mountain movie. Am I getting the title wrong?

Yeah, Holy Mountain.

He was going to make Dune, but never did?

Yeah. Luis was involved in a lot of his projects.

Luis thinks important historical information will come out of several of us putting together what the government was doing there.

There were so many government agencies involved.

I have a question which is kind of related. It's half political, half health-wise.

In one of the interviews with Danny, you said that civilization's best chance of escaping is somewhere in Western Latin America.

Would you say that it's fairly justified at this point to say that civilization is in some process of decline?

That's my first question.

Yeah. As the empire and the ecology decline, the civilization is being taken down with it.

The CIA did a great job on degrading civilization throughout the world with their Congress for Cultural Freedom in 1950, with their action art, action expressionism, and so on.

The way I look at civilization is sort of like an analogy of metabolism at the social level.

If at the organism level we have a process like cancer, which is basically a reversal back to a more primitive life form, which can only produce energy in a very primitive way,

can the same thing happen at the society level or even at the species level?

In other words, can evolution not go in reverse but kind of take a few steps back? Is that possible, do you think?

Yeah. The picture that is imposed as part of the cultural sustaining system justifying this particular kind of authoritarian individualism,

that goes with an ideology and an ontology really about the very nature of what matter is.

It comes down in their view to quanta. It's a digitized view of the substance that we're made of, and so of our cells and genetic information.

It is reductionism made into a universal philosophy of being, which necessarily extends into this individualism, a particular philosophy of individualism as a basis.

Margaret Thatcher's idea that society doesn't exist, it's only the quanta that make up the personality.

The concept of long-range order in the cell, which is necessary for these antenna functions or cell intelligence functions.

Long-range order doesn't exist in the same sense that society doesn't exist for Margaret Thatcher's type.

So the digitizing of ethics, politics, education, everything is part of the very deep degradation of the whole business.

If you see the substance we're made of in a certain way, that means we have that same digitized quality.

Our consciousness is ultimately like computer consciousness. It's only patterns of meaningless fragments of on or off signals.

It really removes the best basis for criticism and correction at all of these levels.

As far as it has become the dominant philosophy of information handling and using computers, then it has destroyed our ability to build up something new.

To use the cancer analogy again, at the organismic level, the organism can only tolerate so much of a reversal, a degradation of the energetic process.

At the social level, do you think something similar might happen?

Or do you think society can successfully revert to a more primitive structure and maintain it stably?

Or do you think, similar to the organism, once the social cancer gets into effect and it consumes enough of the ability of society to produce, to maintain a high level of consciousness, eventually it will be the same collapse as it happens at the organismic level?

In other words, do you think this process can be evolution, social evolution, can go back a few steps and stay at the brute level of the barbarian level?

Or do you think nature will simply not tolerate that and say, "the heck with it, we're going to collapse and then start rebuilding everything from scratch"?

There are reasons for thinking that there has been a threshold passed that if we don't somehow establish an energetic, functional society,

like the ecosystem, there might be a point at which regeneration of forests is no longer possible.

There are some kinds of evidence that suggest that, for example, in the tundra, the melting tundra has a capacity probably, and subterranean methane clathrates are another source of carbon.

As these melt, vast amounts of carbon dioxide come into the atmosphere, going up from parts per million to something like 1 or 2 percent, a gigantic increase in CO2 would change mental function, mental energy,

knock out the inflammatory degenerative diseases, increase the growth of forests,

and allow the reconstruction of much of what has been destroyed, just on the basis of a sort of explosive healing dose of carbon dioxide to suppress the inflammatory processes that were now under the influence of

Do you think large numbers of people, as in, let's say, the United States, hundreds of millions, can naturally live in a peaceful, well-functioning, structured, productive society?

Do you think there is a certain density of people per unit of land that may be limiting a factor, or do you think it's entirely the structures that these people build that either enable the development or contribute to the collapse?

With a population of this size, it's going to take some organization beyond just individual family farms.

It's going to take something like cooperative farms to have efficiency to use land more efficiently than private farmers could, buying diesel for their equipment, everyone having their own machinery.

A tremendous expense would go into trying to survive in family farms that probably wouldn't be possible at this number of people.

But I think there's plenty of productive land that if people can form cooperative groups, it could be politically compatible groups breaking up in the regions in which they start using the land and resources for survival and development, rather than destructive exploitation.

What do you think is the most anti-civilization factor that humans have come up with so far in their social development?

Examples? Money, property, organized medicine, organized education? Is there anyone you would single out specifically?

Militarism is the first. There have been important anthropologists saying that militarism is the essence of civilization, but I think it's the essence of everything going downhill.

What about things like grain agriculture? It seems that health throughout the history of the world has allowed the creation of massive empires at the cost of massively reduced individual health, simply because they went to grain agriculture.

To restore the productivity of the land, it's going to take diversification, getting more trees to create water retention, soil retention, and cool the summers, level the rainfall out so it doesn't come in cloudbursts.

It's radically changing the nature of the landscape. The buffalo and the grass were a very stable soil-preserving, water-preserving system.

Without going back to that and having dairy herds grazing on natural prairie grass, that could be done in some regions.

I think the climate-modifying development of forests, restoring all of the southern and southeastern US forests would be a big step.

Restoring as much as possible of the west coast heavy forestation would be another climate-reversing process.

What do you think the optimal food supply system would look like in a pro-civilization country? Would it be individual farms, mostly focusing on dairy-producing animals and maybe chickens for eggs? Or do you think it has to be more diversified than that?

On a personal basis, I think that's very good with as many perennial plants as possible. Trees producing fruits, for example, so that there isn't a constant plowing up and a waste of energy that way.

What about seafood? Do you think seafood has an important role in society's food supply?

There isn't as much of it as people used to think. It's very easy to deplete it in a few years.

Starting with abolishing fish oil and abolishing the conversion of gigantic amounts of fish into pet food and fertilizer, for example, that would go out with the fish oil industry.

Using seafood for fertilizer and destroying a big part of the ocean animal life is going to maybe help the oceans regenerate too.

With that sort of mode of production, let's use the economic term, do you think that naturally the countries will become smaller in terms of population? There's no need for hundreds of millions of people if they're going to be mostly self-sufficient, right?

Yeah, lots of countries are shrinking in population now and trying to actually recruit more people to come in or to reproduce faster.

It's a natural tendency when insecurity has been the main driver of population increase. Poor people had no social security, so they would have several kids who would be able to support them in their old age.

Every generation needed their social security by expanding the population. As soon as a population gets a fairly modest degree of social security, they stop having too many kids and the population starts shrinking naturally.

You just brought up a great point, Danny, and I discussed last week. Apparently, despite all the propaganda that's being produced by the media, if you look at the actual numbers on demographics, the expectation for the world population is not at all to explode.

In fact, they expect a slight increase to maybe 9 billion by 2050, and then by the turn of the next century, they expect the world population to go back to about 2 to 3 billion precisely because if the processes of improved security continue, then people are just not going to have that many kids as they used to.

That was pretty well demonstrated around 1970. There were some very good articles published then, but the political biologists, the Malthusians, insist that they need more authoritarianism.

Because the population is predetermined to explode, and so you need to control this unruly growth.

So in other words, the way to population control is by helping people, not harassing them and trying to do everything possible to kill them, physically limit their numbers?

Yeah. The idea of a basic guaranteed national income of $1000 or $2000 a month for every citizen, that is going to be a kind of social security that lets people do what they're interested in, get educated, and so on.

People don't like doing the kind of stupid jobs they're doing. If they can stop, they will.

And that will remove the need to worry about who's going to support them in old age.

You pointed out some nuances about that, though, right? If Amazon was giving that UBI, that would be a problem, right?

Do you think that is going back to the roots of what makes us human, more in line with the animal society versus this fake society, which has led us to all these issues that we're experiencing at the moment?

Yeah. The ideology of competition, competitive individualism, has been indoctrinated into people.

But like Ropatkin said, if you look at nature all the way from bacteria up, cooperation is our basic instinct within and between species.

There have been only a few basically authoritarian political theorists who have promoted the Randian tooth and claw idea of nature.

It's all competition and destroy all of the competition. That's a very trivial ideology that is powerfully supported by the right-wing foundations.

Well, I've read this comment a thousand times and somebody will say, you know, Ray is a genius about nutrition, but he's extremely out of touch with his political leanings.

So do you maybe want to address that? What information is required or even has been hidden from somebody that is, like I linked that PragerU video about how horrific communism, Marxism, Stalin, and Lenin are.

A good place to start is by looking at a criticism of the major American historians of the Soviet Union or Stalin or Trotsky.

We have a falsified history of Trotsky just as much as of Stalin.

Trotsky's connections to the US and Hitler have almost totally been eliminated, but there is convincing data that he was acting as an agent for Germany and the US way back while he was still in Russia.

If you look at the evidence that the historians have simply lied about all of these people, for example, if you just think historically about what the great famine, the Ukrainian famine, is called genocide,

where Stalin is accused of creating the famine to eliminate the kulaks and create mass murder.

The US immediately after World War I not only took its troops and sent them with other European armies to invade the Soviet Union, but they started collaborating with Germany on the development of biological warfare.

One of Germany's advances in that was developing a fungus that kills wheat plants by invading the developing seed called wheat rust blight.

Stalin's people and all of the agronomists that were watching the production of crops were seeing a great bumper crop of wheat production coming on in the year that led to the famine.

They were seeing the big heads of wheat growing and when it came time to harvest them, they found that the seeds, the heads were big, but the seeds were absent.

They had been destroyed by the wheat rust blight, something that Germany and the US had been working on as germ warfare.

One historian, a professor who had been an English professor and specialist in medieval English history,

got interested in Russian history when he discovered some outright lies in standard American history books.

He has done a series of about 15 books. A good one to start with is Khrushchev's Lies. Khrushchev was functioning in some ways as an agent of the CIA.

He was going along with the American doctrine and following the analysis of Khrushchev's lies, he then goes into several of the major American historians and documents in tremendous detail,

page after page of fabricated documents, saying that some documents didn't exist, which were incriminating in the wrong direction, using mistranslations.

Every sort of historical evil that has been criticized, these recognized major American historians are basically liars.

A lot of it is because they believe their lies, but you can see that every opportunity they're bending things to suit their ideology.

Have you read, I'm blanking on the author, People's History of the United States, I think it's called?

What was the history?

There's a book by a historian, it's a fairly recent book, it's called People's History of the United States.

Oh, as in?

Yes.

Yeah, yeah.

I mean, I think he has a chapter there where he describes that there was a civil war before the civil war, it was called the War of the Regulation, where basically the regular colonists who were doing all the work revolted because I think it was the very high taxes that the emerging elite was imposing on them, and it was brutally suppressed.

And that episode is virtually unknown in the regular history curriculum that people learn in school.

Yeah, that's a good example of comparing him to the standard histories. And the trouble is that on the issue of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, America has been so closely tied with the development of Nazism and the opposition to the Soviet version of socialism

that essentially there has been no book published in the US that is properly critical of those.

It takes a huge amount of work to look at all of the standard incriminating things and justification for the people who subsidized the development of Nazism, but it's really worth it to try to sort out how we've been brainwashed now for about 100 years.

Just because people say it in the comments, what's your definition of Nazism?

Hitler and his people were aware of public relations techniques, and they looked at what seemed popular.

There was a threat that Germany would be taken over by the socialists, the actual left socialists, and so Hitler and his people said, "Okay, we're going to be the best socialists of all, and we'll do everything the socialists are asking for."

So he got the support of a big part of the left, but totally with the knowledge of the corporations, the Americans, the big banks, all of them knew that he was using the language of progressivism to enslave the people,

and shift them over to support a totally authoritarian government.

Step by step, he introduced the changes and said, "It isn't the capitalists, it's only the Jewish capitalists that are responsible for your suffering.

So we'll get the Jews, and then we won't have to worry about the good capitalists who really run the banks and the basic industry." So he was the agent and mouthpiece of the banks and giant industrialists, both of America and Germany and the rest of Europe.

Do you think there's merit to the idea that he was supported in order to move the Jewish community to Israel? It's called like the – I'm forgetting the name, but it was like some rich Jewish families had actually supported Hitler. Is there any merit to that, do you think?

Yeah, Hitler really wanted to get Jews out of Germany as part of his propaganda business that it isn't capitalists, it's only Jews.

But there were the Zionists who saw that as their opportunity. Same with England. They made deals with the English to give them Palestine,

and they were getting support from Germany for a while to move out the Jews into Palestine, so they had overlapping interests.

And one more for me. Communism, would we all be in a better situation if tomorrow our system was replaced by communism, or are there asterisks to that?

No, it would automatically be just as a rotten swamp of communism as it is of so-called democracy.

Okay, thank you. Thank you for – go ahead, sorry.

Oh yeah, me?

I was going to say thank you for saying that because I think that's the – there's lots of knee-jerk reactions to that. So, I mean, give us a picture of what would be needed to organize in that way.

And also, correct me if I'm wrong, but your biological views stem – or not stem, but they progress into your organizational views.

And so, like some people have asked, like, "Oh, I don't understand where Ray's starting place is," but obviously it's like biological organization, and that stems into how you think it might be –

Yeah, reading Kozirev when I was about 14 or so convinced me to start looking at the counter to the so-called Darwinian competitive individualist view of life.

And it worked everywhere you look, and the way the organism, as well as the species and the ecosystem, Kozirev was right all the way from the biggest ecological interactions down to the simplest cellular and biochemical interactions.

It's interactive and cooperative from top to bottom.

Speaking of Kozirev, I've been wanting to bring this up for a long time. We've heard that you went to Russia, to the Soviet Union, using a boat. Was that hard?

I went on a student boat. It cost $200, and it was a very leisurely nine-day trip. Very pleasant.

Was it from the East Coast to Russia, to the Soviet Union somewhere?

No, just England and then a train through Russia. We didn't go on a tour. We just went where we wanted. We got to just walk around and look for people.

It turned out that most of the people I wanted to talk to were on vacation. Everyone went on vacation for the summer during that period.

I wanted to talk to Lysenko, and I went to his lab. He only came to the lab one day a week, and it didn't match the time I was in Moscow.

I got to talk to the biomagnetism man, Yuri Holodov, and he gave me a very good list of books, things that were available in the US.

A lot of them that my professors never would have heard of.

Wasn't the KGB interested? Who is this American with thick sideburns trying to interview our scientists here?

The science people were very nice and open. Holodov said he wasn't allowed to show his lab to foreigners,

but he told me everything he was doing and gave me this printed big help for my later study.

The tourist people didn't like disrupting their routine by not joining a tour and such, but it was an opportunity to take the subway around

and see who was in the headquarters of the science establishment, walk around the university and such.

What do you think led to the downfall of Lysenko? He was on such a pedestal, and then suddenly there was this 180-degree turn, fully pro-Western.

The Khrushchev for a while supported Lysenko and what he was doing, wanting to support massive organic farms, for example.

Khrushchev supported Lysenko in that, but when Khrushchev went out, then that was the end of Lysenko's career.

Wikipedia says Lysenko was a strong proponent of soft inheritance and rejected Mendelian genetics in favor of pseudoscientific ideas termed Lysenkoism.

Until a few years ago, you could usually get some old professor to almost have a stroke by saying something good about Lysenko.

He was probably a more popular target for a lot of people than Stalin, but for example, he anticipated Barbara McClintock and the work that got her the Nobel Prize.

Everything he did now is not at all controversial, but he increased grain production and food production, and people used his methods.

The academic geneticists still had lots of power. The Soviet Union wasn't at all monolithic. The Western factions in science were very powerful.

You mentioned Khrushchev, Trotsky, and potentially others at the Soviet leadership being at least ideologically aligned with the CIA.

Do you think that's what may have had a role to play in Lysenko's downfall and in general for the rigidification of the Soviet Union eventually?

It's collapse basically turned towards the Western ideals, and that was really the goal to undermine it from within.

Lysenko represented the truly materialist approach to reality.

Western genetics theory represents the imposed rationalist, reductionist approach to reality.

So the Westernization required knocking out any of the remaining actual materialists.

One of Lenin's best pieces of writing was explaining essentially that the concept of materialism in the West is pure idealism, absolutely the negation of materialism in Lenin's sense.

Lenin said knowledge is composed of memory, but the memories are recordings of experience, and experience is always new.

The source of experience is matter, and so matter is only what is potential to be experienced.

So materialism means looking to the future and the possibilities of experience, where the genetics and reductionists try to base their rationalism on an organization of existing knowledge, pre-existing ideas,

and breaking those down into logical, computable units and so on.

The essence of Lenin's type of materialism is essentially identifying it with the life process, the process of being conscious and having new experience is the process of interacting with the material world.

So this is the same idea as Aristotle's prima matter, the pure potential out of which everything arises.

Yep, creative potential.

I got an email from a listener who said, "How can you guys talk about Aristotle and all of these things that he did, when he in fact wrote an entire book and called it 'natural slavery'?"

Are you familiar with these writings of Aristotle?

Oh, no, not that. He did so many things right. You don't want to throw everything out just because of some...

He was much less authoritarian than Plato, for example. Plato did some things right, saying that you shouldn't impose education on children. You should let them play, educate themselves.

You look at what someone has to offer, and Aristotle was a source for much of the good thinking of the medieval philosophers,

much of it got into Christian theology by way of Islamic and Jewish theology, but the good parts of Christianity derive largely from Aristotelian ideas modified by the medieval philosophers.

And Lenin picked out these good, developmental, future-oriented, unfinished business parts of Aristotle.

Do you think preference for idealistic theories may be indicative of some sort of prenatal stress while the person was still in the womb, and then that imprinted them for life?

I think that's part of the imprinting process. Starting with prenatal inflammation and stress, it goes with the quality of breastfeeding.

The baby detects the mother's anxiety or happiness and pleasure, and if the mother is not comfortable and pleased to be feeding the baby,

the baby starts assimilating those ideas and it starts seeing things instead of the mother as a source of everything living and good.

It starts seeing objects as threats. Objects begin to be closed, self-contained, like Nietzschean units, no windows, windowless monads.

This develops into the preference for things that aren't wiggly and changeable, and so it wants timeless objects and looks for the ultimate, unchanging basis of matter, which turns out to be logical atoms or quanta or digits.

Do you think the current epidemic of third-person daycare, so-called, where mothers literally, I don't want to call it abandon, but they give their tiny little babies away to people completely unrelated to the baby,

the baby must be certainly capable of sensing that it's being taken care of, if they even provide the same amount of care, by a person that's completely unknown and unrelated to the baby.

That must be a pretty severe stress for a young organism.

Well, if they get good breastfeeding from the substitute mother, a wet nurse, it can be a very good mother.

And probably the more complex antibody support from a volunteer new mother, if she is giving all of the signals of loving support to the baby, then it's perfectly equivalent, I think.

Very few daycares are like that. I mean, I guess maybe I should have said, the third person, in other words, there are these businesses where it's almost like a farm. You give your baby and there's…

No, no.

Yeah, like the horrible orphanages where they tend them, like in the factory, and bottle feed them, and keep them wrapped up, and are essentially brain-damaging them as thoroughly as they can.

Why do you think orphanages closed in the United States? They closed around the, what is it, the 60s or the 70s?

What was the first part?

Why do you think the orphanages disappeared in the United States? They seemed to be all over the place in the first half of the 20th century, and suddenly they were gone, almost like in a very short period of time.

I guess they found foster parents as a substitute, but lots of the foster parents turned out to be just as bad as the orphanages.

The reason I'm asking is because it seems to me that from an authoritarian point of view, orphanage seems like the perfect breeding ground for imprinting whatever pathological ideas you would like on a very large portion of the population.

Yeah, and for the National Institutes of Health to experiment on.

Yeah, that's right.

Ray, something you might be able to, oh, okay, well, let me back up a second. The last time we chatted about race, some of the things that were said were construed as you having overwhelming support for Black Lives Matter.

Do you maybe want to, one, comment on that, and then two, I wanted to get into whether a pejorative insult to Black Lives, or no, not an insult, but some people say Black Lives Matter is Marxist.

It's what?

Marxist.

I know that you have an understanding of that, and I wanted maybe if you could comment on that.

I've heard that Soros, his organizations are funding it largely. I don't know exactly who they are, but to the extent that they are doing destructive things,

a lot of that I think is historically the police have sent in rock throwers and window breakers to peaceful demonstrations so that the police can then go in and arrest and beat people.

I think there's still a lot of that going on under the name of Black Lives Matter, but I don't know who really is the main influence on it,

but obviously the whole idea that police shouldn't murder citizens, whatever color they are, it's obvious that they are murdering a lot more blacks than whites, especially in proportion to their percentage of the population.

So concentrating on stopping the murderous police should be everyone's concern. It wouldn't matter whether Soros or Karl Marx or whoever was financing them.

But I think people use the word Marxism without the slightest idea of what it means.

Okay, in the I think maybe the first or second chat we had, we already talked about a little bit about this animal reality and approaching societal and health problems from that angle.

Is Marxism the class? Does that make sense given that what we had talked about earlier, like the splitting everything up into different classes and seeing issues in relation to that?

Does that relate to the animal kingdom at all, do you think?

Marx and Engels were creating organizations and doing mass education and trying to clarify thinking.

Engels in particular was planning a more general philosophical scientific explanation of what Marxism implies.

The idea of development is really the only key concept.

Hegel saw logical interactions, the dialectic, as the motor of history and logic reaches a conclusion, history comes to an end, the ruling class sits there forever.

Marx said he had it upside down, basically that things are developing but it's not driven by ideas and concepts.

So its outcome is not going to be the same that Hegel foresaw. Hegel was rationalizing for the ruling class that wanted eternal stable power.

Marx wanted the same thing that a lot of the Christian communitarians, Christian thinkers and people putting their ideas into practice,

trying to eliminate destructive competition, warfare and so on.

If you look at the history of the Christian socialists and Marx, what Marx added was the idea of development as the essential thing.

It's in the nature of people and society and substance to go on developing.

There's a branch of professors who like to call themselves Marxists who are simply Hegelians who think it's more adventuresome to call themselves Marxists.

But they subscribe to the idea of the dialectic having these units.

For Marx, they were provisional. The class division was in the process itself of defining itself and changing constantly.

So all of the units interacting in Marxism are themselves open and in process.

There's not a trace of the Hegelian authoritarian idealism in the thought of Marx and Engels and Lenin.

Lenin did a really good job on the level of language and ontology.

Almost no one reads those because they overlap with Whitehead and the Christian process theologians.

He went a few steps farther than Bertrand Russell in clarifying the nature of language and logic.

And so people just don't like to touch the immense implications of how far Engels went in the meaning of process and development.

And could a dynasty like the Rockefellers or Rothschilds or Vanderbilt or whatever, could that be sustained under kind of a Marxist philosophy, do you think?

The oligarchs, the dynasties, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, is that impossible under a Marxist philosophy?

Or is that more related to communism?

No, the oligarchy, the concept of people that leads to ideas such as a ruling class or class superiority and so on, it's all embedded in history and process.

The working class is what actually produces the stuff that makes the economy run and that becomes what is manipulated by the bankers and so on.

So as they function, they are the source of meaning and change, but the whole thing, all of the parts of the process are in change and continuous definition.

And you can't possibly imagine a terminal state of such a process, much less a stable oligarchy.

Once you have the recognition that these timeless definitions of matter or organization, that these are logically impossible constructions,

they self-contradict themselves out of existence, and so what you have is a continuing biological-like process.

If I can make an analogy, as you said, knowledge and memory is not matter, they actually come from matter, and matter is pure potential.

Would it be a correct analogy, or at least along the correct lines, to say that the social structures, the working class and the ruling class are the analogies of memory and the matter?

In other words, the working class is the potential that's producing progress, and the ruling class is the memory of what the ruling class has produced.

In other words, a record of what the ruling class has produced.

And they want to solidify this memory into an eternal platonic thing that can't be tampered with.

That's where the whole computer ideology comes from. If it's computable, its place in time is irrelevant.

It's what it is, and it always will be that.

The ideology is frozen memory, and it can only persist as far as it tries to freeze the productive processes.

I was reading Lenin's works a few weeks ago, and in one of the books, I'm forgetting the name, he responds to criticism that he's just proposing yet another idea.

Just like any idea eventually will become obsolete.

And he said, "No, all we're faithful to is the process of dialectical materialism and analyzing and learning more into the nature of matter as we go along."

That's the only thing we're faithful to, the actual process of change.

And if you think that's an ideology, that's fine, but it's always going to change.

Do you think that's a more or less correct statement?

Very clearly stated. It's what science should be, and exactly what science isn't working as now.

I see. In regards to intelligence, not sure if you know, but the courts in the United States have ruled that even though companies or really any employer is actually prohibited from discriminating based on intelligence,

police departments and the military are the only two structures legally actually not only allowed to discriminate based on intelligence, but actively encouraged to do so.

To what degree do you think the IQ test is valid?

In other words, police and military are allowed to disqualify people who are too smart, who score too high.

Do you think that IQ test has any merit, or do you think it's entirely bogus?

That principle has actually been in practice in graduate schools in the US.

They don't like critics, and high IQ people used to be dangerous critics, so they were flanked out as quick as possible.

Any organization doesn't like critics, and so they have to, to the extent that the IQ test actually discovers intelligence.

Some of the tests, the Cattell scale was really a class identification rather than identifying dangerous intelligence.

It was identifying acceptable class manners as high IQ.

So the power structure is currently select for stupidity rather directly.

Right. Sociologists and psychologists in the 50s, they did quite a few studies like that showing that various corporations,

the top IQ that had success was about 120 in accounting companies, 130 was okay.

Grad school, it was similar. 130 was fine, but 160 was definitely questionable.

Too dangerous.

Could IQ be a – is there any way to predict criminality because of that?

There's a quote. It's from Neil Brickham of the CIA, and he says, "I have described the CIA as a socially acceptable way of expressing criminal tendencies.

A guy who has a strong criminal tendencies but is too much of a coward to be one would wind up in a place like the CIA if he had the education."

Yeah. There's quite a bit of evidence that the people who choose to go into police departments are biased in that direction.

They see the ability to exercise power as something they want.

I have a question about China because we're hearing about China all the time.

It used to be Russia, now it's China.

Despite the fact that, of course, a lot of it is propaganda, China seems to be engaging currently in a lot of the same imperialistic power grabs that the current empire is still doing.

What is your opinion of China as a beacon or non-beacon of civilization?

Do you think they're doing some things right, or do you think they're just another empire on the rise?

Their empire is based on capitalism now, and the great distress of the Pentagon is that they've been doing capitalism better than the United States empire.

Eric Schmidt's National Defense Commission on Artificial Intelligence described the need to destroy the present economy so that we can go directly to artificial intelligence

and get there faster than China, otherwise China is on course to reach a computerization degree of automation that will make them unbeatable.

So the Pentagon got Google's Eric Schmidt to head this commission, and now Governor Cuomo in New York is instituting Eric Schmidt's plans and advice in New York.

It's definitely what the World Economic Forum has in mind for the whole world process to quickly get rid of all of these middle-level free enterprises and go directly to automation and a complete monopoly of the banks and Amazon-type corporations.

So I guess both countries are going towards complete automation. Wouldn't that make a very large portion of the Chinese population useless, as you said, than currently the US population is?

Yes, and to the extent that both are aware of what the World Economic Forum has in mind, China is probably better organized to deal with this world collapse of the economy for the pandemic than American middle-level corporations are.

So what do you think China is going to do with its 1+ billion useless people once full automation phase is reached or significantly automated?

They're dying all the time. They just have to limit reproduction a little more and they'll shrink fastly, quickly.

So China is very much a copy of the imperialistic blueprint and it's just at a larger scale. Is that what I'm hearing?

Well, it doesn't have a thousand military bases like the US, so it's depending on the market economy and that's what the pandemic was designed to get rid of the ordinary market economy and move straight to a mandate economy.

So do you foresee at some point some sort of a union between the two? It seems to me as if somebody was an evil genius would say, "Hey China, you supply the economy since you're so good at capitalism and you, US, you will supply the military."

Doesn't that seem like a match made in heaven or hell, depending on how you look at it?

Yeah, world capital is deeply involved in Chinese production, so they're already representing a world empire and it's sort of a sub-theme that there's competition between Chinese world capital

and what America has left of productive capital. The trouble is that so much of American industry went to China and other countries that that kind of market capitalism is thought as a threat to the Pentagon.

So maybe the word oligarchy is just looking at the different countries as suppliers of whatever service they can do best. China will do economy, United States will do the weapons, maybe Africa will give the raw materials and the resources, and I don't know what role Europe has. Maybe it's just the aristocracy that's still floating around.

That's close to the picture I have of what they have in mind.

We can wrap up here soon. I did want to say, Ray, what is your prediction or how do you foresee the election coming up? What do you think is going to happen? And then two, does it even matter?

I think it'll matter for two or three months anyway, that it's most likely going to be the installation of Biden.

The real powers are going to do anything necessary to get Biden in, and when they get him in, then I think the virus is going to go on vacation for two or three months.

For a mere estimation, I'm not a doctor, but he seems to have serious mental problems. What do you think is going on there?

That really doesn't bother anyone to have a stupid president. If you read Eisenhower's statements to the press, he really didn't have much knowledge of what he was doing.

There were so many different videos of Angela Merkel shaking uncontrollably, Hillary Clinton collapsing during the 2016 election. What do you think is going on?

Are they neurologically damaged? Do you think there's something else going on? These people seem to be rather physiologically unwell.

Yeah, they have the very best medical care. Looking at Hillary's face, you can imagine the dose of prednisone she's been getting.

I've had friends who were in the army, so they took advantage of the very good medical care that army people do. They died very prematurely.

I think intense medical supervision will deteriorate your brain and immune system pretty quickly.

Do you think there's any country or region in the world that is at least attempting to embark on the right path, more of a pro-civilization attitude? Or do you think it's all under the control of the world capital?

There are little opposition countries. Iran has its good points. Venezuela and Cuba are doing lots of good things.

Anyone who tries to break out of the system, Libya under Gaddafi had really big plans to break out of the dollar economy and to create a new currency to break African imperialism.

It would have democratized Africa to the extent that it would have ruined the empire forever.

There are lots of little countries that would like to break out of the empire and will keep trying to do it. I think that's going to be a good possibility for stopping the deterioration.

On a related note, I heard that Saddam was invaded in 2003 the moment he proposed the creation of an oil stock exchange where the oil would be traded in euros or rubles.

Within a week, there was an invasion already underway.

Yeah. And they say that Kennedy's money policy was one of the decisive factors.

So in terms of pro-civilization, sometimes I guess it does pay off to be small. You're simply not that interesting to the big powers, so you're given a little bit of freedom to do what you want.

Awesome. OK, right. Let me read some of these super chats. These are people that donated and I've been forwarding those donations to you, Christina Tomas, ineffable 500.

Harry Burgos. Let me read them out.

Twenty four ninety nine. Twenty dollars.

Harry Burgos, twenty five dollars.

Michelle, fifty dollars. Well, primitive initiative. Twenty four ninety nine.

Akila, ten dollars.

Brandon, twenty dollars.

Unfortunately, guys, I can't read your super chats. I'd love to, but I just would.

Ray would be on here for hours, you know, so sincerely appreciate that.

I will forward that cash to Ray.

Ray, what are you working on at the moment?

I've been having computer problems, but I'm about to write about education.

OK, I'm going to send you some extra money for computer problems. Ray, thank you so much. You know, these are always super fun to have you on and you take time out of your day to do them. Georgie, parting words to Mr. Raymond P.

I hope his newsletter will talk about how the dream of Ivan Illich is coming true.

The dream of what?

Ivan Illich of the Deschooling Society.

Yes, yes, yes. He's one of the people. Everyone from JJ Russo on Ivan Illich.

Anyway, let everybody know how they can get your newsletter.

I have raypeatsnewsletter@gmail dot com. There's an S in Ray Peat's.

And then final question, can people order your books and can people order back issues of newsletters?

Yeah, both of those same address.

OK, awesome. Thank you for that. Thank you, Ray. Thank you, Georgie. Thank you, everybody watching. Thank you for future visitors as well.

Very fun. Thanks again, everybody. Take care. Talk to you guys soon. Next week, probably. OK, bye, everybody.

Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.

Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack?

We could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies.

I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished.

Victor Technologies, the high flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this year, may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

Piloting the space shuttle is very difficult, difficult. I think, can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits. In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace.

To give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons infinite and obsolete.

Tonight, consistent with our obligations of the ADM Treaty, recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies, I'm taking an important first step.

Instant US retaliation. Nuclear war. Nuclear war.

Piloting the space shuttle is very difficult, the difficult one would think. Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

>> Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat

with measures that are defensive.

That has turned to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base.

And that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security

did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter the Soviet attack?

We could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil over that of our allies.

I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished.

>> Okay, and we're live, Georgie Dinkoff, Raymond Peat.

Thank you guys so much for joining us.

Hit the like button, subscribe, Ray, how are you?

How are you doing?

And Georgie Dinkoff, how are you?

>> Not bad, can you complain?

There are mobs marauding the streets of DC, but other than that seems to be okay.

>> With that, we're going to take some criticism of this show as we're not talking about nutrition enough.

So I did want to, maybe if Ray will humor us, go back to basics and talk about the role

of progesterone, carbon dioxide, the kind of the flow of electrons through the cell.

And so I probably can't talk about this enough because it's, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong right,

but it's really foundational to the bioenergetic perspective.

And so I don't know if we could just, I don't know, maybe paint a picture of what's

happening when you're eating fats, proteins, and carbohydrate, how they combine with oxygen,

what role of thyroid having in that process going through the mitochondria,

producing carbon dioxide, and how that's reciprocating the use of oxygen.

And then what exactly is progesterone doing in that whole process?

>> Okay, proteins, the basic substance of life, protein is acidic, and that means it's electron withdrawing

and proton releasing. And this creates a preexisting, once you have protein substance,

a deficit of electrons. So being acidic, it's already inclined towards oxidation.

It's a high content of oxygen atoms on the polymers that creates the acidity of the proteins.

And that, the organization of Jeremy England at MIT is working out the very basic physical

principles of simply the crudest sense of the flow of energy shining light on simple molecules

and showing that it creates order. And if you once come to the existing proteins,

if you shine light on it or in any way have an energy disequilibrium, you get a flow of

energy through that gob of polymerized atoms. And the flow of energy itself, the way Jeremy

England shows with simple atoms, it, once you have a polymer solution, a co-assurate,

for example, or just an emulsion, the difference, two points that have different electron affinity,

it's going to align these proteins according to where the electrons are flowing. So if you

have an oxidant on one end and an exciting electron source on the other, the potential

electron donor, there's going to be a flow of energy that will create order in the polymer.

My experiment that convinced me that it's a very simple process was to stick two electrodes

through an egg shell and measure the current flow and resistance as the voltage rises

and then the current flow and resistance as the voltage falls, just an oscillating change

in voltage, you get a very strong hysteresis loop on the falling voltage, the flow of

electrons is out of proportion. They flow very easily with little resistance because

as the voltage increased, the proteins created a conductive channel. So what walking makes

the road basically, whenever you have energy flowing, you make the pass easier for the

next flow of energy. And so it's like it increases its appetite and capacity to use

energy. During the process of development and evolution, you get all sorts of side channels

of energy being drained off in creating different substances according to the voltage difference

and availability of the atoms and molecules that have arranged themselves aligned in an

ordered way. So the more complex it gets, the faster it gets more complex yet. And Vernadsky,

early in the 20th century, worked out the implications of this, that the sun as the source

of energy flowing through substance created order and continuing the flow spontaneously

leads to a higher and higher metabolic rate, the hysteresis curve, the bigger it gets the

more electrons that can conduct for a second. And as a consequence of that faster and faster

flow of electrons, you get a more complex system with a bigger brain, for example, which creates

and maintains that higher metabolic rate. So physically, Vernadsky a hundred years ago

had described it in detail with all its implications. And almost at the same time, there were two

or three people working out the medical, biological, and developed implications of oxygen in a

very practical way. Frederick Cook or Coke in the U.S. out of Warburg and the Albert St.

Georgie, we're all seeing the creation of the aspiring organisms as developing and progressing

through the use of oxygen. And they saw that when you interfere with this flow of electrons

by doing something that blocks the ability to use oxygen, you revert to basically a slime

metabolism, a very primitive ancient, underorganized way of using energy. And all three of these

at Warburg, Coke, and St. Georgie saw cancer as using a primitive pre-oxidative metabolism.

And the more or less overlapping with their studies, there were a couple of people working

on the implications of carbon dioxide as the product of oxidative metabolism and the extraction

of electrons from fuel. And the carbon dioxide, if you think of it in mechanistic terms,

the tendency is to not notice that carbon dioxide in itself is acidic. The common theory of

acid that's still built out as the basic thing in science textbooks and courses is the proton

donor theory of acidity. But all of these physical ordering processes caused by oxygen

are really the electron retraction theory of acidity. And carbon dioxide doesn't have

any protons, so if you think of proton release as the essence of an acid, you can't think

of CO2 in itself as an acid, but it's called the Lewis acid. And if it having two oxygens

on one carbon, it's a very powerful electron binder. So if the instant it sits down on

a protein, the protein shifts its electrons to be close to the sender of the carbon dioxide

molecule. So it increases the acidity. You have a pre-existing protein with acidity.

And when you oxidize something and produce carbon dioxide, that increases, intensifies

the acidity. And so that's part of the sculpting effect of respiration. It intensifies whatever

process was creating it in the first place. The more you breathe, the more able you are

to breathe in effect.

I have a question in regards to the solar energy. I mean, given that most of the molecules

that compose us and that are flying around in the universe, they're charged molecules.

And we have this constant flow of energy, at least in the solar system, in the form of

the photons from the sun. Doesn't that automatically imply that randomness, more or less, would

be impossible in such an environment because there will always be an orientation, which

means some kind of an order which the sun will create?

Yeah, just light streaming through gas. It's creating order. When you look at ionizing

radiation, they emphasize the disorder that it creates. But when a cosmic ray particle

goes through something, you can see the trail of changes it has introduced. But just the

flow of light is, to the extent that it's interacting with a matter at all, it's giving

it an order and direction.

I was speaking to a physics professor about randomness recently, and he kind of failed

to give me a definition of what would be a physical test for randomness. I said, "All

of your tests are statistical." I mean, you get a stream of numbers, and if it satisfies

a certain number of statistical tests, you call it random. But in nature, I don't have

a single example, I don't know of a single example, that true randomness has been found.

It always seems to be subjective, right, based on the large of the data set, right?

It's a huge religious philosophical assumption. It's sort of like original sin, you believe

it, and then you follow all the consequences of believing it.

About 50 years ago, I wrote an article the assumption of randomness and all of the consequences

that have come from that very arbitrary assumption.

You mentioned Albert St. Georgie, and I remember you saying this a long time ago, and it was

something that I think was fundamental for me to mildly understand where you're coming

from. In his book, The Living State, he said, "The ability of unlimited proliferation is

an attribute of life. In the simplest living forms, growth is limited only by environmental

factors. In multicellular organisms, this potential has to be suppressed in the interest

of the organism as a whole. It must be restored when proliferation is needed and again arrested

when no longer needed. When the suppression mechanism is out of order, and the cell loses

its ability to stop proliferation, senseless growth can't result, so that is a flood warning.

That's basically exactly what you're saying in terms of, in another article you talked

about sugar and oxygen being these brackets for our energy production. When these things

are blocked, we revert to this unlimited proliferation blob like state. That kind of the M of hypothyroidism,

the person becoming definitionless and looking more like a blob.

Phyroid is the essence of oxidation for living cells. Have you ever seen the experiment with

a tadpole, with a thyroid blocker, or with an excess of thyroid hormones? If you block

the thyroid function, you get a giant infantile tadpole. If you give it an overdose of when

the tadpole is maybe three quarters of an inch long, an overdose of thyroid, you get a miniature

frog about the size of a spider. The foods being reduced into electrons and then going

through the cell and the inventory of oxygen being dictated as I understand it primarily

by carbon dioxide. So what can go wrong in this process? You've talked about some pivotal

what I call landmarks and cellular metabolism such as phosphofructokinase 1. You've talked

a lot about pyruvate dehydrogenase and of course cytochrome C oxidase. What are some

big picture of things that are important for understanding the production of energy and

then how that process starts to degrade as we age?

Maybe starting with the phosphofructokinase 1. Is it that's blocked by things like free

fatty acids and stress and such?

Just the choice between fat and carbohydrate, when you oxidize carbohydrate, you get extra

carbon dioxide as a byproduct. So it's like insurance that you're going to reinforce

the oxidizing process. But oxidizing fat, even if it's a safe saturated fat, you don't get

such a return of carbon dioxide and so that increases the risk of falling over into the

lactate, glycolytic slime metabolism. When you're starving or diabetic or unachitogenic diet,

you're lowering the oxidative state of the cell. By making you less stable, it's opening

up the opportunities for all of the processes of aging, creating collagen, for example,

free radical activities such as nitric oxide, which can degrade your DNA. When you're perfectly

at rest and in good health, it's okay to sit there letting your muscles have a pure

fat diet when everything is very common and you aren't likely to blow out too much carbon

dioxide. But as soon as you have any stress activity that makes you at risk of taking

in too much oxygen relative to carbon dioxide, then that starts increasing your nitric oxide

production, collagen deposition, for example, two ends of the aging carcinogenic process.

And a shout out to Jay Feldman for making me more aware of this, but he says in one of

his articles, and that's somebody that follows your work, right, but he says in one of his

articles, glucose oxidation produces about 25% more NEDH and half as much FADH2 as fat

oxidation. And I hope I don't screw this up. But well, he says, FADH2 donates electrons

at complex two and reduces the amount of uberquinone available to accept electrons at complex

one. And this is the main kind of place where it's being shifted to the reduced NADH away

from the NADH plus in the fat oxidation is this backup of electrons in these complexes.

It might be most often the biggest factor, but I think everything tends to work together.

So many places, essentially, everywhere process is working. It tends to get biased when you're

not over producing carbon dioxide, wasteful energy in the sense of pouring out the carbon

dioxide and producing heat as your only product. That's insurance and it's acting on many,

probably hundreds of identifiable different enzymes and regulators and structural proteins

in the mitochondrion cytoplasm. And he also mentioned like this is complex one primarily

where the or one of the major sources, the superoxide and then that hopefully I'm not

screwing this up. But the superoxide is combined with something to produce the nitric oxide.

And so again, the fat metabolism is inherently increasing like the function or the production

of nitric oxide, is that right? Unless you get the whole stream going, pulling

the electrons out at a maximum rate at the oxygen end, then that in effect is attracting

electrons that would make superoxide and other random damaging electrons. The faster you

run the apparatus, it creates, again, an electron with drawing effect from the surrounding cells,

just as a neighboring atom to atom influence, not a chemical reaction but an inclination

towards a more carbon dioxide-like condition of the structure.

So I have a question. So I guess something like metaling blue, which is technically an

oxidizing agent, it's also an antioxidant because it enables the flow of these electrons

throughout the entire chain the way they're supposed to be. It prevents the formation

of these reactive oxygen species, so it's an actual functional antioxidant while also

being an oxidizing agent. And I think all of these so-called antioxidants, like ascorbic

acid, when it's really protecting you and working the way it should, it's a powerful

oxidant dehydroiscorbate is the predominant form in a healthy working cell, and that shifts

in the direction of ascorbic acid in cancer and stress cells. So the whole idea of antioxidant

has been skewed heavily by denying the role of carbon dioxide and oxidation as a protective

effect, the stronger the oxidation in the normal route, the more wasteful and inefficient

your energy is. Energy production is the safer you are. And if you put in the reduced

form of these so-called antioxidants, those will create destructive oxidation. So overloading

on vitamin C, for example, in the reduced form will interact randomly with iron, for

example, along the way and create toxic, excited, oxidative fragments. So aren't reductants

like estrogen and lactate also these types of bad antioxidants, the destroyer system?

Lactate, I think, should stand out as a polar opposite of carbon dioxide. I think a basic

medical test should be the level of lactate in your blood and of total carbon dioxide

in CO2. The higher lactate gets, the closer you are to being dead.

So basically the lactate is in a sense, just the mere buildup of lactate is enough to derange

the oxidative metabolism. Yeah, you can inject lactated ringers, for example, and cause toxic

damage by shifting your system away from the oxidative state.

Do you know why some of the studies, there used to be older studies that showed that

ringers lactate can cause seizures in susceptible people, but those studies seem to have stopped

about 20 years ago. I haven't seen any new ones because they like some kind of a campaign

but a pharmaceutical industry to, again, hide the truth.

Just in the last 20 years or so, there's been a kind of a deification of lactic acid

and lactate. I don't know if that is powering it, but it's essentially an irrational decriminalization

of lactate.

I think a few years ago, we talked about the NAD, the NADH ratio, which reflects the reduction

oxidation balance. Maybe I was reading a paper by Veach, and he stated that he thought the

NADH should be higher relative to the NAD. Is that a more common belief in academia that

the reduction should be higher than. So you're expressing media.

It's like 99 to 100 of very confused attitude towards NADH, where it should be 700 to each

NADH. The oxidized form should be extreme when you're under stress. It gets down more

like two or 300 to one.

Since NAD is so popular now with those NAD drips and stuff, are people trying to pretend

like they never held that those beliefs before?

Yeah, a lot of them don't know about it, but they think they're raising their NADH. Lots

of places are selling to reduced form of NADH as being better because it's reduced. The

same with ubiquinone and ubiquinol, they say the quinol is better because it's reduced.

And Georgie told me this and I've found it in a few papers, but the higher NADH is one

of the signals to turn off the pyruvate dehydrogenase. And that's like some like ketosis advocates

that write papers like one of his names like Jeff Volek. He talks about how that's a consequence

of ketosis. What's the problem if pyruvate dehydrogenase is turned off? Does it matter?

Oh, yeah, that makes the whole cell shift in that direction. Once it starts with the excess

reducing environment, that tends to reinforce it and make it get worse and worse.

Well, if you turn off pyruvate dehydrogenase, as we just mentioned, you're starting to

immediately build up lactate because pyruvate will be used as the emergency oxidant. So

you're going to start building up lactate and we just said that I don't know if there's

any circumstance where you would want elevated lactate just because it's so deranging to

bring themselves. Yeah, and to keep the production of lactate going, you need something to get rid

of the build-up, the higher and higher levels of NADH. And the intrinsic alternative to oxygen

is the synthesis of fats. And so when the cell gets convinced that it isn't going to get enough

oxygen, then it starts synthesizing fatty acids like crazy. Estrogen and other stressors

will turn on this enzyme system to consume excess NADH

in the absence of oxygen. And so it runs glycolysis, lactic acid production, intrinsically

changing the cell over to consuming energy at a high rate but in a destructive

primitiveizing direction. So sometimes they'll say, well, you know, fatty acids bypass glycolysis

and they form through the activation of acetyl CoA. And so that's good to skip glycolysis and go

directly to the mitochondria. What's the faulty thinking with that argument?

That's going to deprive you of carbon dioxide production relative to what you could have with

oxidizing glucose. And then the oxygen supply is the kind of the credit like because we can

consume our tissues to produce glucose. The real bottleneck of everything is the oxygen supply and

things like lipid proxidation and the lack of carbon dioxide. Those are interfering and estrogen

are interfering with our oxygen supply. I also read a paper recently showing that the fatty acid

cintase enzyme and the beta oxidation structure are also often form complexes with the estrogen

receptor. So anytime you're over oxidizing fat or synthesizing fats, you're also directly activating

the estrogen system, especially the estrogen receptor alpha, which seems to be the, like,

not the bad one, but the one that's actually driving all of the pro cancerous effects of estrogen.

Yeah. And just the stress state, if you overheat a cell, that will activate the fatty acid cintase.

Maybe a while ago, maybe you've said it more recently, I'm not sure, but you talked about like

using progesterone as your stress hormone. So maybe an ideal environment, this reduction

oxidation process is happening normally. And like when does progesterone enter the picture? I don't

know, can you unpack that using it as your stress hormone, something you said a while ago?

Antistress.

Cholesterol is on the very primitive level. Cholesterol is the steroid stabilizing

pro-oxidative equivalent of progesterone. And with higher

organization, the progesterone refines the functions of cholesterol on stabilizing and

directing the cell in that ability to go down the organization building pathways.

But I guess in an ideal world, if a person is producing lots of progesterone, is that

sounds kind of stupid, but like is that used up before you activate the kind of the classical

hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal systems?

The brain has its intrinsic machinery. The ovaries are just there to reinforce the organism

so it's able to safely go through a pregnancy and guarantee the well-being, despite the stress

the mother is going through, the ovaries, and then the placenta are very powerful

progesterone synthesizers. But for everyone who isn't pregnant, the brain is our most intense

progesterone, a factory progesterone, and it's a product.

I have a question related to progesterone and pregnenolone. In some of the older studies,

especially the ones that Celia did, he showed that giving people pregnenolone decreases their

excretion of 17 kerosteroids, which Celia thought means that pregnenolone is giving the adrenals a

break, but without the negative effects of, let's say, taking cortisol directly. Would you say

that pregnenolone probably fills in for some of the roles of cortisol?

Yeah, an experiment in rats around 1950 gave, with a stomach tube, they gave them, I think,

was a 10 gram dose of pregnenolone filling their stomachs with it, and they had measured their

cortisol before the experiment, and a certain proportion of them had above normal level of cortisol,

showing that they were having to respond that way to stress of some sort. But all of them

having received this gigantic dose of pregnenolone, all of them had normal levels of cortisol after

that, so it bypassed the need to produce cortisol. And people tend to think of a mass action effect

that if you eat a lot of pregnenolone, won't you get increased levels of the product, but it's

exactly the opposite. It works like cholesterol and progesterone to stabilize the organism,

so you don't need to resort to the harmful things like albastro and cortisol.

I remember what I was thinking of. You mentioned another rat study, and I have it in my notes,

but maybe they removed the adrenals, but as long as the rat had super physiological levels of salt

or progesterone, it could survive, but then the progesterone would take it.

He noticed a cell you noticed at first when he had the adrenal glands removed, and all of them

died very quickly as soon as they were under stress, but the females that were pregnant

survived as long as they were pregnant, and then died. And so he decided to try non-pregnant

animals removing their steroids and supplementing progesterone, and they lived out particularly

normal, healthy lifespans without adrenal glands if they were given progesterone. It

makes up not only for cortisol, but for albastro and all of the other functions of the adrenals.

And the progesterone is acting on the oxidation reduction balance, but you said on a lower level,

it's ordering the water, and that's how it's so protective in the cell?

If you think of estrogen as doing everything that tends to excite the cell and move it to a lower

non-oxidizing energy system, progesterone knocks out those effects of estrogen and gets the cell

back on the oxidizing pathway. The bioflavonoids that people have sometimes talked about them

as antioxidants or other functions, but the most important ones are working in the same direction

as carbon dioxide and progesterone, shifting the balance slightly favoring NAD rather than NADH.

I have a question on that about progesterone. Looking at the structure of the molecule

and comparing it to estrogen, I mean, basically progesterone is just four rings with two carbonyl

groups. Doesn't that technically make it a quinone similar to a moldine or like metaline blue?

Well, that carbonyl group especially, if it resonates with another double bond,

that is a very strong electron retractor. An analogous to the carbon dioxide effect where you

have two double bonded oxygens on the carbon. The activated carbonyl group has that function,

so when you see it in a molecule, it means that it's likely to be protected in some way.

Jumping back a little bit, Ray, do you remember the arguments of the people saying that the NADH

should be higher? What was their thought process? Basically, no thought.

Just referring to the idea of antioxidants, you need to restore when

vitamin E, for example, gets oxidized, vitamin C will replenish the electron and then NADH

replenishes, vitamin C's, the electron and so on. They extrapolate much too far from the idea of

protective antioxidants and forget that what we want is pro-oxidation to protect against those

destructive oxidations. We talked about this a while ago, but if you're saying the poofa

are essentially saying that some level of lipid peroxidation is desirable when

almost in general, nobody is saying that lipid peroxidation is some good process. It's exclusively

harmful. Is that right? The good oxidation is very focused and antioxidant in the sense of

preventing things like chain reactions of polyunsaturated fat breakdown.

I think the indication of the badness of lipid peroxidation, one of the major byproducts is

something called malone dialdehyde, and I think that's one of the few endogenous metabolites

that are known to be mutagenic, or at least strongly suspected to be so, but nothing that

glucose oxidation produces ever generates any such dangerous metabolites.

Right. I think there are probably a lot more of the breakdown

polyunsaturated fats, but that has been malone dialdehyde. It has been very heavily studied,

three carbon and six and nine carbon units, I think are DNA damaging too.

Speaking of something you probably can't say enough, but isn't it the glycerol from the free

fatty acids that is majorly forming the methyl glyoxal, and that is essential for the advanced

glycation end products that are blamed on glucose? Yeah. Especially in the presence of polyunsaturated

fats, the methyl glyoxal starts to break down, and then those fragments of linoleic or

arachidonic acid, or the higher DHA and EPA, those breakdown fragments amplify the so-called

glycation. It's predominantly a pufa deterioration that counts as glycation.

If the person was like hypoxic and the sugar was being converted into lactic acid,

that could contribute to the methyl glyoxal too, but not nearly as much as the glycerol.

I think by shifting the redox in that direction, I think it probably intensifies that

methyl glyoxal metabolism. Once you get that shift towards lactate, you're shifting against

carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide is a direct blocker of the protein glycation or glycosylation.

In blood physiology, they talk about the formation of carbonyl hemoglobin. The carbonyl reaction

is recognized perfectly well. Higher concentration, the carbon dioxide forms a compound with the

amino group of the hemoglobin protein, and that pulls electrons through the protein,

increasing the acidity, and affecting the affinity of the hemoglobin for

oxygen, depending on how much carbon dioxide is competing for the electrons in the system.

What they don't talk about is that wherever in the body you have similar amino groups on proteins,

carbon dioxide, when it reaches those levels, is going to form carbonyl compounds of whatever

protein you're talking about, which could be insulin itself, or the various receptors on

cells all the way through a cell, wherever a so-called receptor has an exposed amino group.

Carbon dioxide is going to form a carbonyl compound, shifting electrons, so the process

that happens, everyone knows it happens in hemoglobin, but they neglect the physical chemistry that

says it has to happen wherever you have carbon dioxide and the amino groups. That's part of

how the whole system shifts as a unit. You can't talk about individual receptors independently

without looking at how they participate in this global shift towards electron withdrawal.

Two questions related to steroids. The first one is about cholesterol and

pregnenolone. As you mentioned, cholesterol is the fundamental primitive, almost ancient

protective mechanism, a structural protector of the cell, but if there is an environment in the

body where there's a lot of production of reactive oxygen species and metabolism is not working well,

cholesterol can get oxidized into these metabolites that are known to have a role in

cardiovascular disease. It can also get a terrified cholesterol, as you mentioned in several of

your newsletters, is one of the whole marks of aging. But if you look at pregnenolone,

the molecule is structurally almost the same as cholesterol, minus this fatty acid sidechain

that cholesterol has. Do you think pregnenolone can fill in for a lot of the structural protection

functions that cholesterol has, but without the dangers? Right in the mitotic apparatus,

pregnenolone has a very central primitive essential function for cell division and stabilization

at preventing abnormal cell division and chromosomal damage and so on.

But the process that makes cholesterol form these esters, it's the polyunsaturated fatty acid

ester of cholesterol, which gets stuck in the cells and gets stuck there because of an inflammatory

process, started by this lactic acid shift towards everything pro-inflammatory. So I see lactic acid

as starting the inflammatory process leading to the binding of pufa to cholesterol and blocking

the cell's ability to break it down, oxidize the fatty acid and let cholesterol do its protective

work. So do you think the esterification of cholesterol with these pufas is essentially

kind of like an emergency protective mechanism to decrease the availability of pufa for producing

the inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and lukotryans? If you don't have the pufa,

you have an on and off of the saturated fatty acid ester, so it doesn't accumulate

year after year. It conservates a momentary purpose, but when it's polyunsaturated,

the level builds up year after year and your blood vessels or brain or other tissues.

Okay, and my second question is related to the overlap between

pregnant alone and progesterone as far as the stress system is concerned. I think you mentioned

in several of your articles and newsletters that pregnant alone is known to lower the release of

ACTH by the pituitary sort of form of like a negative feedback similar to cortisol in this

way stop the stress system, but progesterone by being a cortisol antagonist at the receptor level,

I've seen several studies where it shows cortisol can actually raise ACTH because the body interprets

the presence of progesterone, I'm sorry not cortisol, progesterone, interprets the progesterone being

an antagonist of the cortisol receptor, it's almost like a cortisol deficiency, so you will

raise ACTH. Do you think there is a potential for this elevation of ACTH being potentially

dangerous if the supply of progesterone is removed? No, I think that progesterone is going to take

care of that experimental setup. I think it was a closed system where you couldn't

see progesterone correcting both ends of the process because physiologically progesterone will

lower cortisol production directly acting on the adrenal, but also lowering the pituitary

activity and the brain activity that activates the pituitary it's working on at least three levels

anti-stress and if you isolate the system then you can see a conflict between

negative feedback of cortisol and progesterone interfering with that but I think that's only a

poorly arranged experiment. So to what degree do you think pregnant one in progesterone overlap

in terms of their anti-stress effects of shutting off the excess adrenal activity?

I would guess that in a similar quantity progesterone is going to be

more active per mole but since it's more common to take a bigger dose of pregnantone

you don't get the powerful anesthetic effect from a very big dose of pregnant one for example.

If you had similar amounts I think progesterone would be the more powerful and by stressor.

But the mechanisms of action are largely the same, largely of 11.

Yeah okay. To wrap up this thought Ray could you like why is this important are we we're living

in this kind of reducing world and we're trying to stay oxidized and that's largely the problem

everything in our environment is pushing us towards that reduced state and that's why

this is kind of an uphill battle is that right?

Yeah even the excess high pressure oxygen of the atmosphere at sea level by displacing

too much carbon dioxide in our lungs even that higher than desirable level of oxygen ends up

putting us into the reducing state by displacing too much carbon dioxide.

What about the iodized air at sea level doesn't that have a little bit of a protective effect

by neutralizing serotonin? Oh yeah yeah if you keep your metabolism in an anti-inflammatory

pro-thyroid high metabolic rate glucose oxidizing condition then it will keep its serotonin and

nitric oxide and those things under control so you can tolerate a high level of stress if your

energy flow is strong enough. Okay one last question for me in regards to sugars there is glucose

then there's fructose and then there's trecholose the fungus sugar which you wrote about in one of

the newsletters of the three would you say that trecholose is potentially the safest in terms of

not generating as much lactate even in compromised individuals?

I haven't seen enough experiments with mammalian cells for example to know how it works for

maintaining the energy system. Okay thank you. One of the reasons for preferring fructose

or sucrose over starch and pure glucose is that ketone function has that

biasing effect putting the cell into a more oxidizing state and what one of the effects is to

for example the fatty liver effect of overdosing on fats or starvation or stress alcohol puts you

in a highly reducing state that tends to produce fatty liver and they do experiments

intending to incriminate fructose as producing a fatty liver the same way ethanol or the stresses

do but in fact when you have stay within physiological limits fructose is an exact

antidote to that fatty liver producing effect of ethanol. Ethanol puts the cell in in a reducing

condition fructose at the right level favors the oxidizing condition and will for example

protect you against the toxic effects even a hangover fructose will get yourselves quickly

back into the oxidizing anti stress condition. Okay just one last question since sucrose

and trecolos are of the kind of so-called non reducing sugars wouldn't just that be like a

reason enough to like use them over as a fuel like to prefer to be a fuel to any of the other

macronutrients given that they're actually they will not put you in a reduced state just by their

chemical structure. Yeah that's my reason for preferring fructose and sucrose but I haven't seen

experiments with treolos in in mammal cells. There is a mention trecolos because there's this

really hearty animal the water bear that can survive like ridiculously lethal doses of radiation

be exposed you know be sending to outer space and sit there and then come back and be

relatively unharmed and it looks like most of its most of the sugars that it uses inside its

cells is trecolos. Yeah I think there it's having the same effect that enositol does

I think that's a structural effect on the water which I just haven't seen how it works

how mammalian cells can handle that but on simpler organisms

the trecolos and what are they say just now the

enositol? Enositol. Yeah yeah enositol which isn't a sugar but it

has a spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl groups that make it more effective than sugar

as a stabilizer of proteins. Have you seen the human studies with enositol that

it cures even treatment resistant depression that nothing else can really touch in terms of

fun drugs? I think it will eventually come into use as just a situational defense like

Pregnantel and/or Progesterone as an all-purpose protective effect. Studies have been done on

various cells with X irradiation showing that it is a powerful anti-radiation damage factor.

So it's structurally acts similar to sugar basically even though it's technically not?

Yeah it doesn't get burned up so fast as fructose or glucose so it can have a longer lasting

stabilizing effect. So switching gears a little bit I've never received so much email

about something then our last talk about Stalin and so I really want to dig deep into

this as possible. Much to the dismay I'm sure a lot of people listening to this. Okay so Ray have

you heard of I'm sure you have but CIA project aerodynamic? No I never heard of it. So I just

kind of accidentally stumbled upon it but apparently it was a CIA scheme to create anti-Russian propaganda

and then somebody like frequently that's brought up in like kind of conservative circles is

Yuri Besmanoff who is supposed to be like an XKGB defector and he talks about how the like

the Soviets were infiltrating America to impose communism and basically it turns out he probably

worked for the CIA. Anyways so if we could like open this up as much as possible and the thing that

I thought was interesting as I was reading an article by Andrew Gavin Marshall it's called

Origins of American Empire on Global Research and he again framed things in an interesting way and

I'd be interested to bounce it off you and see if it was even right but he talked about kind of the

opposition of Stalin to the Rothschilds and also the Rockefellers who wanted to take over the oil

fields of Russia and saw this read us a little bit of this but he says the English the English

Rothschilds were alarmed when the socialist tendencies of the I don't know how to say this

emigres contributed to a massively disruptive Taylor strike in the east end of London in

1888 a young Georgianian communist who would become known to the world as Joseph Stalin was

already organizing laborers to strike at the Rothschilds oil interest in bottom and let me just

get one other critical part here. This spurred protests and riots and young Stalin himself led

the agitation against the Caucasian oil industry in general and the Rothschilds in particular

and so one is is that line up with your view of history and what if a person were to go

against the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers what kind of disinformation campaign would be

launched against them? Oh well the German system very early got

integrated through the Delos brothers with what became the CIA and the British and the Germans

were early aiming to destroy the Russian Empire because they had other plans for that part of

the world and Stalin was aware of these imperialist motives and from an early age even though he was

a Georgian he was seeing the Russian Empire was less evil than the British and German empires

so he was essentially a patriot as well as a labor leader from a very young age

and several of the top Bolsheviks especially I think Lenin was at one point subsidized

by the Germans and probably the British Trotsky very definitely by this Delos faction that included

the Germans and the Rothschilds. Trotsky was a very effective anti-Zarist activist but he never

betrayed the German American British interests so he went through the whole Bolshevik period

as essentially a German saboteur and at one point

in connection with settling the First World War so Russia could withdraw from the war

Lenin referred to Trotsky's behavior as treasonous but at that time didn't have the power to replace

him. He was serving Lenin's and Stalin's interests even though they saw him as betraying Russian

interests in favor of the Germans but after Lenin died Stalin remained an organizer against the

British and German interests where Trotsky continued right up until the time he was murdered to be

effectively working with the FBI British and German intelligence.

So quick question about Trotsky do you think his murder had more to do with Stalin or more to do with

the Western intelligence agencies? I always assumed it was Stalin because

the Moscow trials of 1937 and '38 brought out

such overwhelming evidence that he was deeply involved with all of the imperialists

and the Dewey commission that went to Mexico to exonerate Trotsky of the charges that he was

working for the Germans, John Dewey really ruined his name for anyone who looks at what happened

in that doey commission who was a whitewash job trying to cover up Trotsky's involvement with the

Germans and the FBI. So right according to our Spotify analytics 18 to 34 is our big audience

and with the rise of people like Jordan Peterson and people pushed towards conservative

conservatism that we're going to receive hundreds of comments that say you know Ray

is very smart in nutrition and he has no idea what he's talking about on a political front and so

but besides the CIA program you know that was focused on anti-Russian sentiment like what else

is there and I don't get it. It's much much much deeper than the CIA. The CIA is just

just a surface organization but they used money from the Marshall plan. They got billions of dollars

to penetrate every place they could, they were already inside most of the democratic governments

of the world acting as saboteurs but if you look at the nature of the US government

the Wall Street putch or the the business plot against Roosevelt

revealed by Smedley Butler. All they did when Butler exposed their plan they just made longer

range plans to take effect when the second world war was over so they had to wait 12 years

but the Hitler faction people who had medals awarded by Hitler for service to the Nazi cause

these factions were in control of the democratic big city machines during the war

and they declared their patriotism during the war but they didn't change their their Nazi sympathies

and these people rigged the 1944 democratic convention to install their agent

and so effectively Hitler Dulles puppet Harry Truman to take over the government so it was

the same putch as they failed at in 1933 they got organized and succeeded and the Dulles

brothers meanwhile had deeply integrated themselves even during the war with the Nazi

intelligence apparatus and so the what we know as the CIA using vast funds such as the Marshall

Plan money they simply continued the German basic purpose of working with the banks to rule the world

in favor of the corporations so the whole illusion that they teach in high school and universities

mostly of what the US has been doing in the 20th century it's just as false as the story they

created with these like the Ukrainian and a whole series of so-called defectors

who were just making up stories that the CIA gave them to to publicize well since anybody who likes

Trump is now like a Nazi what the the the problem with the Nazi philosophy is that you eugenics

supremacy idea and then that is what we're all going through right now like that it's an extension

of that idea is that right yep it was slightly embarrassed at the end of the world war so they

they had to change the names of their eugenics journals to human biology or human genetics rather

than eugenics but the ideas didn't change they took a more acceptable form but there has been

steady progress against the the more humanistic strains of American civilization

supplanted by the the Dulles brothers alliance with the German and bikers factions

have a question what do you think is at the core of this not even rival rival it's just this

fundamental opposition between the west and for a lack of a better word the east with Russia

being at its center which seems to have been going since at least the 1850s long before communism

and and capitalism kind of formed as ideas there seems to be something deeper driving this to do

you know what that may be um the the empires made it very obvious what they wanted

the British Empire wanted to absolutely control the world and slave that whole land mass including

Russians and adding it to their Indian Empire and the Germans were envious and thought they could

knock out the British Empire and rule all of those resource hoarding Asians and get their resources

and the US and the bankers outsmarted the German nationalists so that they were a faction powering

Nazism but they didn't have any of the good nationalist impulses that made the German people

hysterically favoring Nazism it simply Nazism without the nationalism not not doing anything

favoring common people moving straight to the control of all of the world resources

directly by the very limited ruling population and then because Russia the Russian Empire

the Soviet Union was powerful enough to say we're not going to participate in your plans or at least

we're not going to we're not going to give up without a fight basically that they that automatically

made them target public enemy number one in the eyes of the financial powers because that's the

one thing they can undermine them okay yeah yeah so just to put a bow on this you can't really

understand the framing of Stalin without understanding his opposition to the banker families the

Rothschilds the Rockefellers do you think that's accurate statement yeah he was actually defending

the interests of the majority of the Russian people and was an actual patriot betraying

he didn't make the deals with the imperialists in the first place like Lenin and Trotsky but

Lenin very quickly betrayed the Germans and Stalin had never

gone down that pathway to power he went straight up from being a labor organizer

and I did receive a few emails from people russians who disagreed with the characterization of Stalin

like what what would you say to those people specifically are they they had great grandparents

or grandfather grandmother who passed away well the the Russians since since Stalin died

Khrushchev started it and then Gorbachev finished it off acting in conceding a lot of their power

to to the west and the banks and Khrushchev started the the slandering of Stalin just totally

inventing history that ever happened and Gorbachev continued that so what russians have been hearing

for more than 60 years is also a historical lies in line with what the CIA and the Germans were

making up by the way I've never met a single Russian who spoke positively of Gorbachev

they all considered him a sellout so the emails you may be even getting it they're probably about

I mean they're they're not very positive of Stalin but if you ask those people about their opinion

of Gorbachev I my guess is it's not going to be very positive either yes Gorbachev was was a

teenager when the Nazis came through the Ukraine and somehow he survived and I've always suspected

that he was owned by the Nazis right from his teen years as a plant waiting to take power

so I think to maybe a young conservative person they're they're fully aware that like something

we've talked about like the Gloria Steinem CIA feminism is like some kind of psychological

operation but they're not aware that this the anti-communism anti-Stalin is part of a

is very similar and then they're their condition by it is that accurate

oh yeah the the even very bright highly educated history students

don't don't have a shadow of suspicion of how totally corrupt

history writing has been for 130 years or so in the United States and that's because the spider

at the top of this is just completely concealed and you you don't hear about the Rockefellers the

Rothschilds the DuPonts the Morgan's the Vanderbelts like these these families that can kind of

influence everything are completely hidden from you yeah they are still governing like Wikipedia

it's called at the the alleged Wall Street plots

Wikipedia is a good 800 of these deep state powers well okay so it stands what we were talking

about into modern day and just wrapping that up like again the Nazi the Nazism is the eugenics

philosophy and correct me if I'm wrong but there at the moment there are kind of two

power factions one this got the liberal more Soros gates at L types or the what was

technocratic yeah the technocrats and then Trump is kind of on this other side of religious

prophecy or he's aligned himself with those people and in this situation the the trump the trump

people are more pro-life than these kind of genocidal eugenics maniac people

yeah unfortunately the most humanistic trend has got connected with with the craziest

groups but they have a little bit of things in common in that they do want the the mass citizen

citizenry in chains in some way shape or form it so is that why um again there's kind of uh

acquiescence to to a lot of these like trump isn't opposing vaccines or opposing the lockdowns or

or is that just because he can't he doesn't have power to do so well you know he invited

when right after he was elected he invited Robert Kennedy jr to come to Washington to

talk to him about heading a commission to investigate vaccines and then Pfizer donated a million

dollars and Trump called Trump it's called Kennedy and told him the deal was off

so again that's the self-reservation that you talked about a while ago is that right

yeah yeah so so no politician is going to save us from this mess is that that's the bottom line

I yeah the um there were so many reasons that JFK was slightly hesitant about doing the the

most evil thing is that the the CIA Nazi faction had and the in-store and for that slight hesitancy

he was killed and uh everyone since then who has a brain knows knows that they can't act without

to the extent that they do anything serious they won't live long enough to to see it happen

um I have a it's like a relatable on the side note did you know Ray that there was a civil

lawsuit filed um by the surviving relatives of MLK Martin Luther King and there was a court

decision um in a civil court which decided that MLK was the victim of a government led conspiracy

and that was used to me too yeah there's a book written about it and the evidence is just

overwhelmingly clear and um it's sort of I think the same person who wrote JFK the unspeakable

about the covered up facts of of his assassination he attended the whole trial of MLK

assassination and made made a really convincing case of how clear the evidence was

have you ever met a person or has even heard of that trial to my knowledge nobody no American

that I've ever met no he has even heard that there was a trial that said MLK was killed by

conspiracy. Yeah and probably very few people have heard that Robert Kennedy Jr.

knows exactly who the agent was that killed his father the security guard that shot him in the

back of the head with his gun in contact with his skull uh he uh he he sold the gun and uh told

the buyer that it had been used in the crime but he told the police that the gun had been sold

six months before but uh he he worked for for for a uh a Pentagon uh financed uh uh industry in

Los Angeles and just went to the uh hotel uh a week before the assassination uh so he was clearly

put in place by the the deep state and uh that the evidence is available to to show that

the uh well well accepted official story that 95 percent of Americans believe that it's

absolutely disproved by uh many many bits of evidence. I just wanted to bring this up to you

because I thought it was interesting. Ray I sent you a link to a movie a while ago I don't know if

you remember it but it was called cold case hammer scold and there's actually a documentary

about dog hammer scold and and who killed him and why and they came to the conclusion like you said

that the CIA did it and they they even showed a photograph of the the ace playing card in the

collar of dog hammer scold which is like a calling card of the CIA but in that movie they find like

a kind of key witness and um they're they're interviewing him and they say you mentioned uh

actively spreading AIDS and he goes there was a unit from simar one of the things we that we did

was we went into African countries and the director says and how has that done exactly and he goes

through inoculation and the director says through vaccines and he goes yeah through vaccines and

so um and your estimation is like the delivery uh of vaccines is just like a kind of a diabolical

concept in general and then and then I did a little bit more research about um the special I

know I'm all over the place I apologize but the special uh cancer special virus cancer program

and dr boy graves who passed away mysteriously found a blueprint in an old book in it I'm not an

expert you know but it looks like a diagram for the the manufacturing of HIV have you seen that stuff

no I haven't seen that uh but um uh the I think the evidence is is

it indirect but um you can't look at the contextual situation without knowing that they at least

we're trying to make something like HIV people were talking about it

14 years before the HIV came on the scene people working at the germ warfare lab we're talking

about that intent to make a racially specifically lethal virus that has been part of the germ warfare

culture for decades and then like you we can only presume that they they kind of failed right

because coronavirus is not well assuming that it was created in a lab like it's not that deadly

and so there must have been some kind of change of plan and the maybe the vaccine is the the

death the fast death agent rather than some kind of slow slow killing agent it I think they probably

have very lethal equivalent vaccines but I think that the uh big picture is that they have made a

lot of noise going back years that they were working on this sort of thing and that they were very

careless and having hundreds and hundreds of leaks and getting that in the news for years so

the Chinese being sensitive to American germ warfare from their experience

they would react very quickly to any virus even if it was just a harmless cold virus because of

that setup that the germ warfare people had been sloppy it was like sending a very pointed

message to China getting them to react powerfully and quickly stop the virus however deadly it might

be within just a few weeks and go back to business but the whole purpose I think was an excuse

look to Chinese did it we have to shut down our economy and create this

great scare about a harmless virus no evidence has ever come out in fact the definition of an

infection they haven't convincingly showed that anyone was hurt by the infection

simply the presence of the virus and the sick person was enough to say here is a deadly virus

but since almost all the people were already sick from something else the presence of a cold virus

you can easily connect any decline in their health to the presence of the virus

the whole story of the virus by replicating causes the sickness that just isn't a proper

virology the mechanism of getting sick is something that can be defined very clearly that they haven't

done it and so there's really no science whatsoever behind the idea of a pandemic

have you seen some of the news coming out of China lately saying that they will not under

any circumstances use the western developed vaccine they didn't say why I mean some people

say oh because they want to develop they won't improve their grade but that's not what the

statement said the state kind of it's kind of led to the underlying tone was we simply don't trust

those vials that will be sent to us and if you think we're going to be injecting our people with

that you're just crazy to expect something like this yeah right when people's I mean what what

when people start going brain dead because they got the vaccine it our democrats gonna brain

a blame conservatives and conservatives are gonna blame uh democrats like it well how do you think

that's gonna play out do you think there'll be some kind of realization of what's happening or

or are people so dumbed down that it's uh it'd be even difficult to figure it out

as they'll probably say it's being caused by something else

caused produced by some other enemy maybe some products coming from Iran maybe pistachio nuts

or something causing brain death so so do you so the do you there's evidence of things like that

they've done before like uh releasing something extremely toxic and then blaming some other import

or something like that yeah but mostly the easiest thing is not to notice it unless there is

very very easy to make connection to your enemy if it's just people dropping dead suddenly

you can't uh if it isn't easy to connect then they're just going to say it isn't happening

like to decline in SAT scores starting around 1980 roughly they blamed that on

more poor people taking the test but when you look at the absolute scores it's the

the biggest decline within the high ranges of scores so something has been happening

broadly through the population for 40 years now affecting the brain especially the brightest

functioning brains have you seen some of the recent articles in the press which i was kind

of surprised to see uh wall street journal even new york times are now saying oh my god we destroyed

the economy speaking of the u.s we made a mistake this was a horrible decision but it was it was

unavoidable we had to do it but oh god did did we act um so do you think there's maybe some honesty

in that assessment now they're freaking out that i don't know third of the population the u.s will

be um you know unemployed potentially homeless and riding or do you think it may be like uh you know

just another game if you can imagine that everyone that the paper failed to read or even hear about

eric smits publications and speeches and conferences laying out that plan uh uh over a year ago

15 months ago uh is saying that exactly destroying the existing economy is necessary so we can be

china to the uh automation artificial intelligence economy dependent on needs it so we have to

destroy uh this old economy made up of small and medium sized businesses who who is schmitt aligned

with or like when did he uh become such a big player in kind of the i don't know the deep state or

the kind of the bank or relationships um well the pentagon was a financer uh of google uh and so

he was in uh early uh i i think that the the likelihood is that he was uh pentagon ally before

google came into existence even yeah he was a computer science professor um in a famous

programmer and if you look at his the history of the grants that he's been getting the vast majority

of them are dod and in the i know they're probably a lecture topic but like the relationship between

kind of the um power elite and the pentagon are they taking cues from the philosophy of those people

or how does that work um the um the the philosophy is so so deeply connected to their religion

and uh their racial superiority feelings of meritocracy uh if you look at any of these people

they're they're going to be uh subscribers to the uh idea that we're in a meritocracy

and that that's what's happening that the power of the pentagon is pushing uh the best of everything

uh evenly the so-called progressives like norm kamsky are committed very deeply to this genetic

determinism uh uh that uh fits perfectly with with the old eugenics idea and uh the modern

technocratic meritocracy uh so i have a question about this genetic geneticism i mean there's been

over a hundred years of pursuing medical therapies life extension you know uh you know eternal youth

etc etc by developing the genetic nothing has come out of this like nobody can be that dumb

and continue to hope blindly that something will come out of these therapies of this approach

actually this scientific approach considering that nothing has come out yet not not even something

that says you on the right path like how is that are these people brain damaged or is it is it more

of a religious being a blind fit of blind faith yeah the blind faith thing it is a kind of uh

brain damage uh the uh Peter Duesberg uh got out of the uh war on cancer at a fairly early

stage simply because uh his brain was working better uh nothing but brain function is needed

to account for it uh and people just can't accept the fact that uh 95 of their science professors

are hypnotized by these religious ideas and genetics and meritocracy and so on

a little a little bit related but uh i've been struggling with the concept of a person's

like aging like the rate of aging and then how healthy they are because uh correct me if i'm wrong

but maybe somebody could be a slow uh at a slower rate of aging but they could be like

extraordinarily sick like they could be a i don't know they could be into some weird

stuff or something what how do you distinguish the two and am i even framing it right

i i'm not sure what you mean like so maybe somebody is uh looks aesthetically like they're

not aging that quickly but they're like a pedophile or something like that's an extreme form of sickness

oh oh yeah hypothyroid people uh often have uh uh very even their bones are late to mature

and uh the the um mucopoly saccharides in their skin uh make their skin look very youthful

into their 50s and then the underlying uh problems accumulated from hypothyroidism

show up and and the uh crash into uh uh heart disease or dementia or cancer or or something

very suddenly but uh they can uh seem to seem to be very juicy and youthful uh all the way through

their 40s okay so they're like internally rapidly aging is that right yeah okay yeah yeah and it's

just uh keeping the skin stretched uh like when you when you feed a cow a lot of estrogen it

retains water that looks all shiny and sleek uh in the same with with a middle-aged woman

retaining subcutaneous water uh when she stops the estrogen suddenly you'll see

creaky skin where have been shiny and sleek so what speaking of shiny and sleek i was just about to

say have you seen eric smith's face he always strikes me because no matter every time he speaks

to the camera he's in front of some kind of a audience his forehead and his entire face is

always shining and i always thought he's always sweating but he's not they actually asked him

several times and he said no it's just how that's just how i look because i have a youthful

a youthful appearance he claims that he's not sweating but his face is oh shiny and his skin is

always is always looking like it's just like he said something there's like water underneath

that's stretching it out that's interesting maybe he'll be flight shouldn't oh that's the other

thing um i've also noticed that uh people that that are uh youthful looking through like various

procedures or or hormonal treatments with estrogen in especially human growth hormone

tend to have this appearance but then they seem to have a very sudden decline

um do you know what may be triggering this is it basically the system is finally giving up

systemically uh yeah the the growth hormone uh uh uh is an oligosin some ways to estrogen it

increases the the deposition of of ground substance and can can make things

plump up and actually have more protein immaterial but they're being degraded structurally

so that it predisposes to things like kidney disease

age acceleration in cancer right yeah uh last question then i'll read the superchats then i'll

let you go ray thank you so much for um just sharing your time with us uh everybody listening

please give this episode a like uh comment and subscribe sincerely appreciate it um one one last

question so ray like a 17 year old or 18 year old that is uh degenerating struct structurally like

his structure is breaking down and the 25 year old with the severe kind of um mental illness or

whatever but that is not degrading they are they're adapting to stress in a different

different way but but it's both our sickness is that is that right yeah yeah sometimes just the

amount of protein in the diet uh a low protein diet uh can uh lead to very high cortisol

androgen ratio low d-h-e-a and and of uh pregnant alone high cortisol and that that makes your skin

look uh uh uh aging even when you're at 17 or 18 uh and that can be countered by getting your your

calcium and protein uh uh intake increased vitamin D and and thyroid correction uh and

things like the uh the the nerve diseases uh uh seizures uh schizophrenia uh basically uh brain

swelling conditions uh sometimes just antihistamines anti serotonin aspirin can alleviate what seems

to be a uh of severe psychosis okay thank you for that ray let me just read these really quickly

one one last question um uh speaking of the protein amount of protein in the diet do you think that

the protein requirements may be decreasing with age because the reason i'm asking this is that

there have been several studies showing um a significant extension of lifespan with a low

protein but high carbohydrate diet and there are several uh tribes in the amazon that have been

noticed to have that diet and they have almost no aging and no cardiovascular disease yeah i think

what they're doing is keeping down the uh mathyanine a tryptophane and cysteine which are the pro aging

parts of the protein uh and uh like cal or calorie restriction uh lower sos as well as

polyunsaturated fats and uh if you just uh uh lower those half a dozen uh specific uh uh stress

promoting uh substances uh then the uh higher protein like if you get lots of glycine uh

and gelatin in your diet the protein doesn't have those uh age advancing effect okay one last

question because you reminded me of something ray if you were going to sit down and have some beef

uh and hypothetically you could only choose one would you balance it with calcium balance it with

gelatin or would you drink coffee to inhibit the iron absorption i i would um drink milk or uh

uh eat eggshells or something i i think balancing the the phosphate uh uh would would have priority

and then hypothetically the second choice after the calcium

i've taking aspirin to uh limit uh the uh iron absorption coffee and aspirin

part of their benefit is they help to reduce your iron load i'm so sorry right it is very

popular to talk about iron right now but one of the things that is not mentioned i know you've

done a lot of work on it maybe we could just uh talk about it quickly because i i kept you for

two hours but the estrogen and the hypoxia and the the low thyroid increasing the estrogen and and

promoting the hypoxia that is what's making the iron accumulate and displace the copper

it's not it's not just uh right like this random iron overload situation is that right

um you know people have been animals as well as people have been tested

the amount of estrogen present in pregnancy uh causes an extreme increase in the efficiency of

iron absorption and retention and everything that estrogen does tells your body that

something is wrong with your respiration system and so it uh increases your ability to retain

iron as if that's going to fix the the respiratory system but in fact it reaches a point where it

starts uh competing with copper and uh aging the system uh creating uh stress uh that

subtracts copper from your system so the iron overload is actually hyper estrogenemia is that right

to say um i think so in most cases and then if the iron saturation is high it's acceptable to give

blood given that's not a terrifying event but but aspirin and focusing on the dairy that's a

long-term solution and yeah it's going to work pretty quickly though uh your turnover of cells

your metabolic rate is high uh you're sloughing off a lot of skin and hair and intestinal lining

that takes uh iron out uh every day uh so if you keep your your milk uh to meet ratio high

and have some aspirin and and coffee to restrict the absorption of any iron that is in your food

you'll steadily get rid of the iron what about people that have donated like many many many times

throughout the year like what what is wrong with them like i like i i for like uh hemochromatosis

i've read about people that give like blood every week for like a year like how is that possible

if they're absorbing it very efficiently or if they're liver and marrow

were really stuffed with iron it can take take a lot of elimination to to get the level down so

so maybe their estrogen was just off the charts and in childhood or or something like that

uh yeah you you can carry a wrap around a lot of iron uh without any symptoms

as long as you're in a a good oxidizing state that that doesn't activate it and start the free

radical process awesome okay here are some superchats uh michael for a hundred dollars he says thank

you dr peat thank you michael sincerely appreciate linda bell for five dollars she says thank you

pj martinez for four ninety nine thank you pj sincerely appreciate it stephen uh stephan

gomas for four ninety nine um we can't uh ray would be here all day if we asked him questions of the

superchats but we appreciate it stephan all forward that to ray uh kristina tomaj for nineteen ninety

nine thank you dr peat uh thank you kristina uh prea a hundred for a hundred dollars god bless you

dr peat thank you uh prea uh harry burgos many long-time supporters of the show thank you guys for

twenty five dollars thank you harry uh machele i won't even try your last name for fifty dollars

thank you so much machele appreciate it primitive initiative for twenty four ninety nine thank you

all for taking the time to share your knowledge and insights thank you primitive initiative and i

received an email from kana who was twenty dollars and that was just a donation v email so i will

forward these alter ray ray just to confirm you are receiving the the paypal things i'm sending you

correct oh yeah thank you that that's from all these people uh that watch the show so

uh ray parting words you know i can't thank you enough for for joining us today georgie and i

we really uh feel honored to have you on but at parting words uh and i'm not sure when we'll meet

again because i'll be going mexico so that might be a little sticky to find a internet situation

but parting words for everybody ray um no nothing special georgie dinkop uh i guess not much as well

except question for ray's newsletter i thought it was a little bit uh i don't want to say darker

than than usual but at least i read it this way do you think things are getting worse or they're

at this point stabilize at least socially politically etc i i think it's uh at the point

of getting extremely bad uh very fast if people don't rouse themselves to start acting intelligently

like uh tomorrow in in berlin there will be a big demonstration for civil rights

even though the berlin government said it was uh organized by virus deniers

next worst thing to holocaust deniers i guess well let's hope they succeed right because a lot is at

stake yeah hope hope a million people turn out one last thing before we leave ray how can people

subscribe to your newsletters oh uh ray peat newsletter at gmail.com and then uh same question

with your books how do they obtain those you can ask about them at that same address and same

with old copies of your newsletters yeah there's a list of digitized things that are ready to send

out we're still working on digitizing the rest of the 40 years that was my next question you have a

list of the like i was going through my collection of your newsletters and i i came across one i had

never seen before and so i mean that's funny because i go through that all the time so uh but you have

like a list of the names of all the newsletters searching i don't think under people understand

how many newsletters you have uh it's um 360 something like that well amazing awesome ray uh

thank you so much and serially appreciate it uh dorgy thanks a lot i mean it's always

in order to have you uh i i recommend maybe publishing these as a bundle and putting them

in the library of congress i think just making them searchable um through through an institution

like loc library of congress i think you'll um increase the audience tremendously yeah i i'm hoping

we can do that uh it's a long job getting these old typed manuscripts uh in digital form without

lots of mistakes right i think it will be worth it awesome guy if the listeners thank you guys so

much future listeners thank you so much ray thank you amazing to have you on georgie dean

caust thank you guys so much and we'll see you soon and everybody have a safe weekend and thanks again

Okay, and we're live. Georgie Dinkov, Ray Peat.

Georgie, I won't interrupt. Go ahead and ask your question.

Yes, I saw a study. It was published in 2004.

It was a bodybuilder in Portugal, and he went to the hospital for some reason,

and the doctors there tested, given some blood tests,

and he admitted to taking steroids.

But when he showed the doctors the vials that he'd been using,

the amount of steroid in the vials was really small,

yet he was having these surprisingly...

He had huge muscles, and they tested for other chemicals,

and he denied taking anything else.

So they said, "Well, is that the only thing you've been taking?"

He said, "Yeah, I've been only taking that steroid,

and every time I take the steroid, I'm also taking 200 milligrams of caffeine."

So they said, "Hmm, maybe the caffeine is somehow promoting the effects of the steroid."

And then they tested in vitro dihydrotestosterone with caffeine,

and caffeine increased the transcription effects through the androgen receptor

by 300% to 400%.

So they concluded that caffeine somehow increases the effects of the anabolic steroids,

at least of androgens like dihydrotestosterone.

So I thought the same thing may be happening with thyroid.

Yeah, one of the good things that the favorable steroids do, progesterone,

the androgens in particular, is to stabilize the cell in such a way that it can expel calcium and sodium,

get rid of the short circuit of the energy process, suppress glycolysis,

and move into the oxidizing state.

And caffeine works probably analogously to the steroids and carbon dioxide,

but a structural electron-attracting effect that they all have in common.

Have you seen some of the older studies from the '50s and '60s showing that

they administered some kind of a vitamin D analog that was really good at calcifying soft tissue?

I think it's called dihydrotacasterol.

And then they showed that androgens can actually decalcify the cell,

like testosterone, progesterone can get the calcium outside of the cell.

Yeah, caffeine does the same thing.

I think that's the basis for caffeine's protective effect on the liver,

against fatty liver and fibrosis of the liver and carcinogenesis.

All kinds of cancer-causing processes are blocked by caffeine,

whether it's radiation or chemical carcinogens or even viral processes.

All of those are pro-inflammatory, pro-glycolytic, reductive processes.

Caffeine is like progesterone, supporting the oxidizing structures.

Do you think caffeine has some effect similar to sodium,

like it's perceived by the cell as a mild irritant,

so the cell ramps up its metabolism in response to being exposed to caffeine?

Yeah, that would account for the stimulating effect,

but at the same time it has the calming in a bigger sense,

stopping the dangerous types of excitation while letting the cell respond to adrenaline.

Do you think there's a certain amount of caffeine daily that's optimal, in other words?

Because I saw some studies saying that anything more than three cups of coffee a day,

they only looked at liver disease and I think osteoporosis,

but they said anything more than three cups didn't really increase the benefit.

These were all epidemiological studies, so I'm wondering if there's an optimal amount.

Most of the best studies that I've seen found five cups a day.

The benefit was still increasing in the population.

They said five or more cups per day, for example, had the least liver disease and least dementia,

and in some studies the least cancer.

So I think it depends on your need, and in some people it might go up to maybe 50 cups a day.

When I was hypothyroid, I felt best when I would have 30 to 50 cups,

just constantly drinking fairly strong coffee with cream.

Wow, so you were drinking more coffee than milk at that time?

Oh, no, I drank a lot of milk too, but generally not together.

And interestingly, I didn't torment a tremendous amount of urine because I evaporated so much.

At that time I would steam up even a fairly big room full of windows in cool weather.

What would be a good sign that the person is getting their metabolism too high and getting a bit dehydrated?

Because I know that if you drink very sugary drinks and you evaporate a lot of water,

it can increase the blood osmolarity, but what would be a good, I don't know,

like maybe urine color or viscosity, I guess?

Is there anything else that can be used to test?

Oh, yeah, if your urine starts getting very dark and thick, you should take more fluid.

It doesn't hurt to pour excess water through.

Sometimes in hot weather when I would drink gallons and gallons, I might make maybe two quarts of urine.

Depending on the heat and activity, sometimes I could evaporate two or three gallons out of my lungs and skin.

But in cold weather, it's probably a little bit better to be on the high osmolarity side, right?

Yeah, probably.

Okay.

Okay, kind of the theme of the show, it goes along with what we were just talking about,

but last time we talked about kind of turning food into electrons, passing them through the cell,

making carbon dioxide ATP water.

And so I thought this week we could talk about carbon dioxide, right, and the calcium, potassium,

magnesium, sodium regulation, because I know that's like a central theme in a lot of your work.

And so I think we had this conversation probably like two years ago, but I was just too stupid to have it with you.

So we have Georgie here, and so he could fill in the gaps.

But yeah, maybe starting from wherever you see as the most pertinent,

the regulation of those ions and then what happens when too much of the calcium and sodium go inside the cell

and when too much of the potassium and magnesium is lost, or wherever you think is good to start.

You can start almost anywhere and end up the same place.

Things that support oxidation like thyroid hormone are acting largely through forming carbon dioxide.

And the carbon dioxide, one of its major functions is in proportion to its increase,

it suppresses formation of lactic acid as the alternative low energy form of metabolism.

And the low energy goes with letting large amounts of calcium and sodium accumulate in cells,

leading to eventually chronic structural changes.

So keeping your CO2 up steadily and on average year after year after year

gradually prevents the structural changes so that keeping yourself in the CO2 thyroid responsive state

doesn't get harder with aging.

If you slip back periodically, going out of the carbon dioxide state tends to allow,

for example, collagen to increase and lipofuscin and other esters of cholesterol

with polyunsaturated fats and other things increase sort of as harmful baggage that builds up with age.

So just steadily keeping your energy up day after day has the long range protective effect

of not letting those things accumulate so fast.

I think it was maybe our last conversation I listened to it again,

but you were saying the calcium, whether it was sedative or excitatory, depended on carbon dioxide.

The CO2, one of its actions in the bloodstream is to form compounds, not exactly calcium bicarbonate,

but complex ionic compounds keeping calcium in an ionized state.

And when it's in this ionized water soluble state, it isn't in a state that has an affinity for cells.

So if you just for whatever reason like hyperventilating, if you hyperventilate for a minute or two,

you'll notice that your fingers and hands and feet tend to cramp up.

Losing the calcium outside of cells in the water soluble state,

along with other changes happening with the loss of carbon dioxide,

the calcium goes into cells instead of being held outside by the CO2.

So the absence of CO2 in the cell in itself makes the cell gain an affinity for calcium.

And the lack of CO2 in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid will cause the calcium itself

to go into a form that has an affinity for inside the cell.

Isn't the mechanism for entering the cell by calcium binding with ADP,

when ATP levels drop and ADP levels rise, calcium has an affinity for ADP

and that's what's getting it inside the cell or at least keeping it there?

Yeah, ATP binds magnesium so most of the magnesium in the cell is attached to the ATP molecule

and with the lower energy state, less thyroid and less CO2,

the ATP isn't reformed as fast so you have more ADP which binds calcium

and so that's part of the cell increasing its affinity for calcium

at the same time that calcium is losing its affinity for the blood solution.

So if you're not producing enough CO2, there's nothing to take calcium outside of the cell as well, right?

Yeah, calcium or CO2 effectively by streaming as it's formed,

it's constantly streaming from the mitochondria into the extracellular fluid

and that tends to drag with it the mobile ions, calcium and sodium.

So they're being mobilized by the moving stream of carbon dioxide

and when you lack carbon dioxide, the formation of lactic acid takes over

and lactic acid has the same destabilizing effect that calcium does or lack of oxygen or lack of thyroid.

The lactic acid shifts the oxidative-reductive ratio of everything in the cell

so that all of the components lose their electron affinity to a small degree

and so the cell to some extent loses its interactive affinity for carbon dioxide and progesterone

and so those become less effective if you're producing lots of lactic acid

and letting the cell get into its more reducing state, tends to be a higher pH

which causes the cell to take up more water.

And lactic acid itself is to some extent a chelator of calcium

and it turns out that probably the best explanation for calcification of the arteries

and other soft tissues is that lactic acid goes into the blood vessel

or other cell at an abnormal concentration along with increased calcium

and together the chelated calcium and lactate combination with phosphate

tends to form permanent crystallization inside the cell.

But that sort of thing happens everywhere.

It's just most visible in the blood vessels because they're constantly exposed to the lactic acid formation

by the endothelium and red blood cells as well as what's happening in the tissues.

I saw two studies recently showing that blood vessel calcification can be directly triggered by cortisol and aldosterone.

Do you think those effects of these two steroids are mostly due to the fact that they interfere with the cell's oxidative metabolism

and increase the production of lactic acid?

Yep. Blocking the energy. Aldosterone and cortisol both directly interfere with mitochondrial oxygen use.

Ray, you see the intracellular calcium, is that like a signal or a message to slow down the system or is it like a biological screw up?

How do you interpret that event?

In one situation it's a challenge to adapt to and so it can be a growth and development signal that accounts for our particular shape.

But that same process, when we are no longer evolving fast enough to invent something new to do with it,

then you start getting the effect in which it makes tissues stay too long in the excited state.

It gets harder and harder to rouse your oxidative resources to relax the tissues and squeeze the calcium out and stop the lactate production.

I have a question. If there isn't enough ATP to bind the magnesium, my guess is that magnesium will simply flow out of the cell, right?

Yeah, apparently that's what happens when your thyroid is low.

So the medical test, if you go to the doctor, they'll say, "Oh, let me test your blood magnesium."

Well, maybe magnesium in the blood shouldn't be high. That wouldn't necessarily be a good sign, right? Since it's an intracellular mineral.

Yeah, exactly like potassium. High potassium often means that your cells are dying and letting their potassium leak into the bloodstream.

Same with magnesium.

Do you think there's any good blood test for intracellular magnesium?

I saw some kind of a company advertising erythrocyte magnesium test. Would that be a good one?

Except that erythrocytes are mainly glycolytic in their energy system.

So they aren't very representative of the oxidative cells.

But it's undoubtedly better than just the dissolved magnesium.

What about hair and nail test for magnesium?

The nails are probably pretty good, but hair is exposed to the air and any water that you get on your hair.

Dust and fumes bind strongly to the hair, so hair is a terrible way to get an impression of what's happening in your body.

But nails will be better and for things like steroids, maybe?

Yeah, especially toenails where they're relatively shielded if you wear shoes all the time.

Ray, you mentioned the intracellular calcium being excitatory, but also in your Fats, Functions, and Malfunctions newsletter,

you quoted an article that said that DHA and arachidonic acid brought the cells to a new steady state of moderately elevated intracellular calcium level,

where the cells became virtually insensitive to external stimuli.

This new steady state can be considered a mechanism of self-protection.

Can you expand on that?

I thought it's kind of interesting, as the cells are becoming insensitive to stimuli,

you could probably draw a direct correlation between the person becoming insensitive to stimuli and I don't know if there's a connection there.

I think so. Probably the long range thing is the cholesterol PUFA ester that interferes with the proper stabilizing functions of cholesterol.

So in a way, it's keeping the cell in an activated condition that lets calcium remain too long.

In that semi-activated condition, you just don't have as far to move in effect. If you're already half contracted, then it takes a giant stimulus to get you to contract the rest of the way.

The readiness to contract is a very high structural energy storage effect.

ATP and proteins in a hydrophobic state, when they get just a sufficient trigger, will undergo a huge activation with contraction if they're a muscle cell,

but with a powerful contraction if they're a nerve cell.

If they're in already a half-activated state, the triggering mechanism is already half spent,

so it takes something different to get the residual, mostly glycolyzing cell to become functional and active.

Have you seen the recent study on patients with COVID-19? I was surprised to see the doctor there said that, as if it was common knowledge,

that apparently calcium and albumin can bind and directly deactivate endotoxin.

Is that a specific property of calcium, or do all of sodium, potassium, and magnesium also have this property?

I don't know. I haven't seen that.

Another example of an excited state that loses sensitivity would be cancer cells.

They have the inability to relax, so they're always acting as if they're being powerfully stimulated,

and that makes them blind to the things that should be stimulating them and guiding their functions.

What's the differentiator between if a cell becomes overexcited and shifts into the proliferative stage versus becoming –

you might have described it already, but not being sensitive to it. Is it an age of the cell type of thing, or what?

Probably a lot of things acting on whether the mitochondria can activate the cell dissolution process of apoptosis

in which the cell activates the right proteolytic enzymes and dehydrates and harmlessly deconstructs into particles that can be phagocytized.

That takes a certain amount of energy and residual resources to get things to die in an organized way.

When the cell is beyond that state of responding to stress with a neat dissolution, making way for replacement cells,

then you get either a nasty inflammatory lingering death that poisons its environment in all directions, or it becomes a deranged,

at best a scar tissue or keloid sort of cell, at worst a tumor cell.

I wanted to go back a little bit to speaking about the cancer cells being overexcited.

I'm sure you've seen – there's some older studies showing that giving animals with cancer GABA drugs,

like the benzodiazepines, was highly therapeutic.

How is GABA – I mean, we know that GABA is an inhibitory system.

How does GABA act on the calcium in the cell, if at all?

Do you think it somehow gets the excess calcium out of the cell and that's what allows it to calm the cells down?

I've always assumed that, but it just occurred to me that one of the functions might be to activate the calcium binding system,

calbindin, for example.

That's an alternative to getting it out of the cell.

I hadn't thought about whether GABA can activate that process.

But, yeah, that's the basic thing, that the GABA gets rid of the sodium and calcium excess.

Okay.

Another interesting study, again, old, because these things don't seem to be interesting to doctors these days,

showed that infusions into animals with cancer of the magnesium salt of ATP – so magnesium bound to ATP –

quickly made their tumors go away over a period of just six to seven hours.

Do you think that's the energetic supply of ATP and magnesium was the signal that allowed the cell to get rid of its extra calcium and calm down?

Yeah, I think so.

The compound with magnesium probably is the right way to use ATP therapeutically because other forms will break down easily,

become external.

Free ATP is very dangerous.

It's one of the major danger signals or activators of inflammation.

But when it's bound to magnesium, it is probably not toxic outside the cell and can get inside the cell easier.

As far as your recommendation to consume a significant amount of calcium daily,

aside from calcium lowering parathyroid hormone and lowering inflammation and increasing cellular metabolism,

what other reasons are for recommending the high calcium diet?

Because some people have been emailing me saying, "Somebody is in a state of calcium overload, giving them that extra calcium.

Wouldn't that make things worse for some people?"

No. The harmful calcium overload usually results from high parathyroid hormone,

which usually goes with increased aldosterone and other problems.

But the overload is intracellular under the influence of the anti-metabolic action of parathyroid hormone.

And so vitamin D and calcium act first to knock down parathyroid hormone, the lower the better,

and let the cells return to the self-maintaining state.

People who have had their parathyroid glands removed surgically for kidney disease

are often recovered from lots of the symptoms of chronic kidney disease.

Their sleep improves. They might stop having seizures.

A lot of inflammatory things are decreased when they simply cut out the parathyroid glands.

But that's because there are poisons being produced mostly in the intestine when the kidneys are failing

that drive up the parathyroid hormone.

And if your kidneys haven't deteriorated, then taking vitamin D and getting lots of calcium

will hold down your parathyroid hormone and let the cells re-energize themselves and get rid of their calcium.

And when I talk about vitamin D, I mean the cholecalciferol, definitely not the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.

That activates the so-called vitamin D receptor and those are activated by high parathyroid hormone

and they do the dirty work of the high parathyroid hormone.

Turning on lactic acid production is one of their essential actions.

Production of lactic acid in the bones is the sometimes useful effect of parathyroid hormone.

When you need to draw calcium out of the bones, the parathyroid hormone makes lactic acid locally

and dissolves enough calcium to move into the bloodstream.

If you have persistently high parathyroid hormone, then that keeps acting and you're constantly moving

calcium into the bloodstream and in the presence of the lactic acid being produced everywhere in the body

under the influence of parathyroid hormone, then the calcium gets stuck in all of your tissues.

So two questions. So I guess you just explained.

So I guess as you know, most people with cancer, advanced cancer, have this condition called hypercalcemia.

That's probably due to the excessive lactic acid which all tumors produce and I'm guessing high parathyroid hormone, right?

Yep. I've been thinking for a long time that there should be a regular testing every time a person has a medical blood test.

I think they should check the level of lactate in the blood.

You can diagnose cancer even if you can't find a tumor.

If you have a serious cancer developing somewhere, your blood lactate is going to be increasing

and the lactate becomes carcinogenic to other tissues.

So the cancer doesn't necessarily have to metastasize to spread because it's putting out the toxic levels of lactic acid

tending to burn other cells into either cancer or cells that favor the development of cancer.

Just for posterity, where would you want to see the lactic acid? What would it be a healthy amount?

Now they usually say the normal range is 0.05, I think it's millimoles to 2.2

and already at 2, the mortality is increasing. People with 2 and above when they come into a hospital

are less likely to get out alive than the people who are well under 2.

So I would say maybe 1.0 would be a maximum compatible with health.

Did you see the new studies that came out with COVID patients entering the hospital?

The ones that didn't survive, more than 80% already had some level of lactic acidosis before even getting admitted to the hospital?

Yeah, I think the lactic acid is starting with endotoxin.

Lactic acid produced under the influence of endotoxin becomes the agent of all of the problem symptoms.

Blood clotting, increased serotonin effects of all sorts, inflammatory, swelling, congestion,

edema of the lungs and the brain, all of those things are activated by the lactic acid.

In your fats malfunction article, you said that intracellular calcium increases lipolysis.

How is that working out? Is there a signal to like the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenals to release hormones?

No, right inside the cell, like in the heart muscle or anywhere that is acting.

Epstein-Meyerson had his famous calcium triad, which was the Japanese researcher Fujita

concentrated a lot on the ubiquity of calcium intracellular concentration with deterioration and death.

But Epstein-Meyerson said besides contraction, calcium acts to increase proteolytic enzymes and lipolytic enzymes and nucleic acid degrading enzymes.

Those were the three main effects that made calcium deadly under the prolonged influence of stress and lactate.

And then you also say it increases the phospholipases that release arachidonic acid from cells.

So this is something that doesn't have to happen. So this is exclusively bad, right?

Yeah, the prostaglandins are just one of the consequences of lipolysis, sort of random inflammatory lipolysis.

It creates even the lesser than like compounds become toxic when released inappropriately.

In that Fujita paper, he calls the intracellular calcium, I think he calls it like the final common path of cell death or something.

Is nitric oxide involved in, I don't know if he wrote about it, but is the increase in nitric oxide, is that how it's basically killing the cell?

Yeah, there are a lot of pathways that converge on nitric oxide too, like on calcium uptake.

They all end up lowering oxidative production of energy, blocking CO2 formation.

I have a question about lactate. So let's say there is a buildup of lactate in the body.

I've been looking at some, again, older studies showing that methylene blue can directly reoxidize lactate back to pyruvate.

Do you know of any other intervention that may help lower it outside of breathing into a paper bag?

The right amount of caffeine helps, but all of the anti-inflammatory things are helpful.

Wouldn't quinones in general help to reoxidize lactate back to pyruvate?

Yeah, I think vitamin K and ubiquitin are part of the defensive process.

I noticed there was a study that was using a low-dose doxycycline because they noticed it had an anti-osteoporotic effect in postmenopausal women.

One of the surprising findings that they had was that these women's lactic acid dropped dramatically.

So I thought maybe doxycycline, being a quinone itself, was acting like methylene blue and reoxidizing lactate back to pyruvate.

Yeah, that is very reasonable because some of the flavonoids like trisetin, just by a slight shift in the electron affinity

in the direction of more oxidized retraction of electrons, will have a big effect on stopping lactic acid formation

and getting the cell back into the oxidizing condition.

Would things like apigenin and norengenin also have similar effect?

Because I noticed you mentioned these in a few of your articles.

Yeah, I think those are the three most active, but there are several with similar, not quite as intense, pro-oxidative effects.

There is a Wikipedia page about natural progesterones, molecules that act like progesterone in existing nature.

They call fisetin, apigenin, and norengenin phytoprogesterones because they activate the progesterone receptor.

Really? I've never seen that.

Yeah, if you type in Google "phytoprogesterones," immediately a Wikipedia page will come up and these three are listed there.

I was pretty surprised, but they now recommend them as...

Well, they don't recommend, but they're saying these could be alternatives to women who don't want to take steroidal therapy

because these apparently act the same way.

Yeah, they're all doing a little bit of the same thing.

So there are probably a thousand favorable things you can do,

but medicine hasn't got under the idea that the organism works as a whole.

So they think of disease and symptom and drug as singular things rather than part of this almost formless interactive whole.

Ray, when I talked to you a few years ago, I asked you about prolactin and parathyroid hormone and how they, from a layman's stance,

they seem to have so many parallel functions.

Do you think one evolved before the other one?

And then you quoted a paper from, I think, a gentleman named Raymond saying that they would tend to follow each other, but occasionally...

Yeah, that has been discussed several times that at different stages, evolution invents one way to do something,

and then as it advances, it invents another way, but it doesn't give up the first invention.

And so usually we have two or three or more ways of doing everything.

What do you make of, like occasionally I've seen lab work and the prolactin will come back, I don't know, at five or six,

and then the parathyroid hormone will come back at like 40 or 50.

Is that just a moment in time that there was a difference in those hormones, and then if you measure it an hour later, it might be radically different?

Different things like thyroid deficiency increasing TSH fairly directly increases prolactin without such a direct effect on parathyroid hormone.

But there are many levels of the interaction. The thyrotropin release hormone happens to activate prolactin release, so they vary closely with each other.

And cortisol tends to go in the same direction. High cortisol and parathyroid hormone and prolactin are doing similar things,

but each one has its own other regulatory influences. So one can go up without the other, but they tend to be doing the same calcium mobilizing action.

And then if I'm remembering this right, in one of your, maybe it was your milk article, you talked about parathyroid hormone related protein and that being related to what was it, endotoxin?

So the parathyroid hormone and the calcium metabolism has this direct connection to endotoxin, is that right?

Yeah, just as one of our basic threatening environmental factors starting the threat to disorganize the cell, making the cell respond.

So because you mentioned parathyroid related peptide or related protein, PTHRP, it's known to be dramatically overproduced in cancer patients.

Do you think that's something that cancer cells produce themselves and that's actually responsible for hypercalcemia?

Or is it PTHRP is the elevation is result of endotoxin and it just happens to be a bystander to cancer as well?

I think both of them happen, but they know that cancer cells usually produce a lot of the parathyroid related protein.

Okay. What would be the purpose of the cancer cell producing that? To mobilize, to basically get more calcium for itself?

Yeah, apparently.

Okay. So what is the cancer cell trying to get to? Because if we assume that the cancer is not trying to kill us, it's simply a sign of a deranged metabolism or a bad environment.

What is the end goal of the cancer cell? It's trying desperately to survive or what is it? Why does it need more calcium?

What it really needs is something to ionize the calcium and get rid of it.

But I don't know whether there would be an actual survival function. It's possible that it's just actually too disorganized to have any survival meaning.

Okay. In one of your articles, you mentioned that cancer cells have such hunger for polyunsaturated fats that they can get quickly overloaded with them and die.

Maybe the same thing may be happening with calcium. There's just a desperate attempt to, I don't know, to trigger apoptosis, right? If they get overloaded with calcium?

Yeah, that's a reasonable thought.

A few more questions and then we can move on to politics. Ray, I think something I've heard very frequently is like a Ray's emphasis on calcium is misguided because evolutionarily we would have never got that much calcium in our diet.

So what is your perspective on that?

Oh, well, eating leaves. Leaves are very rich in calcium relative to the protein in leaves.

That's why where milk gets its high concentration of calcium in relation to protein is mainly from the leafy diet.

And if fruit is our evolutionary main driving force, the high sugar metabolism allows a low stress metabolism that can use its calcium

very efficiently, not wasting it. In experiments with a calcium deficient diet, when they added sucrose, I think it was dogs, the animals that got extra sucrose had stronger bones even without enough calcium in their diet.

So the idea that we evolved eating gigantic proportions of meat, do you think that's pure fantasy?

Oh, yeah. I don't think that's possible because of the effect of high phosphate to calcium ratio. One of the effects of eating a high fruit diet with sucrose, 50% of sucrose being fructose,

fructose metabolism lowers the redox tendency, lowers the reductive force of the cell, shifts it into the oxidizing state the same way vitamin K and phycetin and so on act on the cell.

And so the pattern of cell metabolism when we have enough sucrose is to not let calcium get into its toxic condition, which is favored when the cell is in a high redox state, lactic acid dominated.

Do you think the evidence, I might articulate it wrong, but like the isotopes of, those people say that's evidence for the high meat eating. What do you make of their evidence that they say man evolved eating lots of meat?

Do you know which isotopes you're talking about?

I shouldn't have done it on the fly. I should have looked up, but they always say there's like, I don't know, evidence, like physical evidence that man evolved eating lots of meat, but I should have obviously picked up something.

Okay. Last question, unless Georgie has more.

Yes, I have a few. Well, I think first going back to the meat eating, even carnivores don't eat meat all the time. They hunt, you know, if they successfully kill an animal, they eat and then they go hungry for like, I don't know, a week, 10 days before they managed to hunt another animal.

I don't think humans were capable of being much, much poorer predators than the apex predators. I don't think our ancestors were capable of eating meat every day and probably not even like once a week.

So, I'm not buying that either.

And I think also I wanted to add to raise more of a question. Fructose also tends to deplete phosphate in the body, right? Because its metabolism consumes phosphorus.

What metabolism consumes phosphorus?

The conversion of fructose into glucose in the body, I think it consumes phosphorus, right?

Yeah, it lowers the intracellular phosphate at least.

Right, so that should lead to an increase in the calcium to phosphorus ratio.

In effect, yeah.

Okay.

And I think a lot of the big-mouthed carnivores probably ate quite a bit of bone calcium, chewing the small bones.

The reason I'm asking the question about fructose and phosphorus is that somebody sent me a study recently and the study says, "Don't eat fructose. It's going to lower your energy levels because if fructose metabolism consumes phosphorus, you will not have enough to synthesize ATP."

What would you respond to that argument?

Well, there's an optimal level of ATP and you never get your phosphate so low that you can't use it to make as much ATP as you need.

And an excess of phosphate has not only the calcium binding effect and cell damage, but it has a tendency to keep the cell in the excited state.

In itself, it is pro-excitatory and that burdens the cell and makes it tend towards inefficient, ultimately glycolyzing metabolism.

So, keeping your phosphate under control, that's the good thing that parathyroid hormone does, is help to excrete phosphate.

But the accumulation of phosphate with aging, that's what has made the classogene so interesting the last 10 or 15 years.

The anti-aging protein is mainly a calcium phosphate regulator preventing those pro-aging effects of too much phosphate.

So, the androgens and some steroids basically getting the calcium out of the cell, that may be done through the activation of the clotogen, right?

Yeah, it is connected to all of these other interesting signaling and energy substances.

Have you seen the, there are a few studies only, there are not that many, that the polycosinols, the very long chain saturated fatty acid alcohols are also capable of activating cloto?

No, I haven't seen that, but that effect of a long saturated chain, whether it's alcohol or the tail of a fatty acid, that has a structural calming, stabilizing effect in lots of ways.

So, it's logical that it would be favoring the cloto.

I'm sure you've noticed, you've heard that a lot of Caribbean countries have a very high number of centenarians per capita.

And it's considered, they call it the Caribbean paradox, because they also smoke a lot of cigars and drink a lot of rum.

Do you think maybe their high consumption of polycosinols, which are present in sugar cane and many other of the foods, traditional foods eaten there, do you think that may have something to do with their longevity?

Yeah, there are several good studies in which there's a powerful correlation between saturation of the tissues and longevity.

The more poofer you have, the shorter your life is.

Speaking of evolution, I cannot believe I've never asked you about this, but the Bosca skull and people with those larger head kind of situations, if you were to speculate, what do you think is going on there?

I'm sure it's more than just nutrition, right?

They probably lived up high on Mount Kilimanjaro and grew watermelons.

And when you look at those skulls, are there parts, like is the cerebral cortex, is it just, it's like getting taller?

What do you think is happening there?

Yeah, a lot of these things we've been talking about increase the foldedness of the cortex.

The low energy things tend to give us a flatter, less wrinkled, thinner cortex.

According to, for example, your progesterone, the estrogen ratio, your carbon dioxide, the lactate, the cortex is growing all the time given the energy and conditions.

And as it produces more functioning cells, it gets thicker and in effect longer and has to wrinkle since the whole, the linear or the area of it increases.

And on a sphere, that means it has to get more and more wrinkly and that thickens it even though the layer in itself is keeping the same structure.

The wrinkles get deeper.

I think that's the thing that can in a very short time account for a very big skull like the Boskop.

You mentioned, I think it was our last episode, that the last 130 years of history were fraudulent.

Historians seemingly are completely uninterested in something like the Boskop skull.

Are origins more mysterious and more interesting than a standard history book?

Oh, yeah.

All of the history and biological books are written to confirm a paradigm which is radically wrong.

If you start with Franz Boas who was sort of the founder of scientific anthropology, he studied head shape.

And the reason he isn't popular is that he showed what profound effects environment can have on the overall shape of the skull in just a single generation.

People with parents coming from the same region of Europe with the same – in the community in Europe, their heads all had the same ratio of length and width and height.

But if they lived in New York or Puerto Rico, their heads changed according to the head shape of the people around them.

Obviously, something about the climate and diet in a single generation changed those so-called evolutionary anthropological physical characteristics.

Well, I'm not an expert in his work. I know some people will probably laugh.

But Graham Hancock, what do you think about the ideas that he floats like Atlantis and things like that?

Is there any merit to any of that kind of information?

Probably considering how doctrinaire and wrong most of the conventional things are, I think it's good to look at anything that is being offered that isn't obviously completely insane.

It's hard to find out what's insane and what's not because the mainstream information is often so wrong.

Is there a person better than Graham that you think has things more figured out?

Well, anyone that starts with some kind of empirical information that can be checked on or that is well-established, then you can check how they reason from that existing information.

One of the structures he was talking about was Gobekli Tepe or something, and apparently that changed how old we were or something like that. Do you have any additional information on that?

No.

Gobekli Tepe. It's in Turkey.

I have a statement and two questions. Speaking of size of the head and the jaw and whatnot, actually vitamin K at this point has really strong, still anecdotal evidence as the doctors would say because there's no study on that yet.

Just even smaller amounts, which is like a few milligrams a day, drastically increase the ratio of head to body size, and also they make the jaw wider in a matter of months to just a year.

That immediately invalidates anything about this being set genetically and not changing within a generation or two.

Have you noticed any changes in your facial structure from using vitamin K, Ray?

I haven't connected it to anything in particular, but yeah, with aging, everyone's head gets wider.

A thing published about 40 years ago on sort of a handbook of aging data showed that with every decade that they had data up to the age of 90, there was a steady increase in the amount of DNA inside the skull.

The head is getting wider, the skull cavity is getting larger, and there's more cells inside the skull.

Just like a rat, we never stop growing for as long as we're alive, right?

Yeah. I think UC Berkeley or somewhere in the Bay Area, Marian Diamond in the 1960s was working with a group studying the effect of an enriched environment because every generation, the rats grew a bigger brain and were more intelligent.

She followed that up with looking at the effect of intrauterine hormone exposure and found that confirming the work of others that increased progesterone prenatally radically increased the brain size.

Estrogen not only decreased the mass of the brain and the thickness of the cortex, but it even increased the shape of the face, making the jaws bigger in relation to the cranium.

It was like a more mature-looking rat. The progesterone produced a bigger cranium in relation to the face, and so a sort of a baby-faced rat, more intelligent-looking but younger-looking too.

Have you noticed a difference in the pictures of Hollywood stars from the '50s and '60s versus today? They look strikingly different, and to me the "modern stars" are kind of hideous. Have you noticed that change in faces?

Yeah, I think Trump's wives illustrate the stylish change in Hollywood and all of the advertising culture. He has picked out the stylish contemporary women to marry.

Going back a little bit to the Boscovskill, I noticed some articles that some anthropologists are studying the Indians that live in the Andes Mountains in Bolivia and Peru.

One of the things that they noticed that I remember reading that was maybe about 10 years ago is two things.

First of all, even in very old Indians living up in the mountains, there was no decline in DHEA and testosterone in the males.

Those males were just as virile and energetic in their 70s as were men in their late 20s to mid-30s.

Another thing they noticed…

Go ahead.

The second thing they noticed more recently was that the older males looked more like children, and their heads were bigger.

So I immediately thought of the Boscovskill, and I thought that maybe the same process of living at altitude is not just in Africa, but probably there are many other cultures where we can find such examples if one cares to look for them.

Progesterone is compensating, tends to increase and make up for the reduced oxygen concentration.

The progesterone facilitates the delivery of oxygen and sugar to the tissues, and so they tend to have a higher ratio of progesterone to estrogen during pregnancy, which would favor that proportion of the skull.

When the Vilcabamba age thing was, I think, National Geographic wrote about it in the 1960s, a woman reporter went to interview some of these people who had the church record showing that they were in their 130s or 140s,

and she said one of the old guys around 150 hit on her.

Speaking of…

One more question.

Go, go, go.

Again, speaking about longevity, in one of your… I think it was an interview, or news that I don't… Actually, it was an interview.

You talked about flamingos, that nobody really knows how long they live, but the people are now fairly certain that they live past 150.

More importantly, there was no difference in terms of health span.

In other words, an older flamingo was just as healthy and energetic as a younger flamingo.

Do you know what that could be due to?

I guess something in the diet?

I think high salt and calcium. They tend to live in salty lakes, and I think their diet is exaggeratedly overloaded with both calcium and salt.

Is it the algae that they eat or something? Like from the algae or something? The fish?

Yeah, and fish. When you take a mouthful of fish, you're going to get some of the salty water.

Okay. That's all I had.

Obviously, I want to talk about Trump since you brought him up, right?

I know you've done a lot of work on personality, and when I was reading through Carl Rogers' book, I'm Becoming a Person, something he said really stuck out to me.

I think it's towards the end, and he said basically to paraphrase, when he would go through a client-centered therapy session with somebody,

they ended up being more, he said, toward becoming a process and not needing the information to be planned out, and they could be more fluid and go with the flow.

I can just read this thing here. He says, "The second observation is difficult to make because we do not have a good word for it.

Clients seem to move toward more openly being a process, a fluidity, a changing.

They are not disturbed to find that they are not the same from day to day, and they do not always hold the same feelings toward a given experience or a person, that they are not always consistent."

Thinking about that, do you map on a certain hormonal situation to that at all, Ray?

Oh, yeah. All of the things that reduce stress and rigidity, lowering your serotonin tends to make you less authoritarian and rigid,

and so increasing cell energy makes you more flexible mentally. Margaret Mead, who was Franz Boas' student,

in her work she showed that literacy freezes everything associated with literacy, which tends to be authoritarianism,

but the literate cultures tend to freeze and give the impression that cultural change is as slow as biological evolution is supposed to be.

She showed that in the non-literate cultures, as soon as anything changed requiring a cultural adaptation,

they were absolutely flexible and simply intelligently revised their whole culture.

So the whole idea of cultural history being a long-term rigid process falsifies what the person is really doing.

They are constantly reinventing culture if they aren't having it drilled into them by authority.

And then a similar question for Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

You think that self-actualization and then that being associated with wanting to help others

and not necessarily caring about what other people think of you, do you think that is a similar hormonal situation of feeling really good?

Yeah, the perception of others right from the beginning, you feel empathy as soon as you recognize that you are in the world.

You see how others express their body movements. You feel in your own body when you see them make a gesture or expression,

you feel what it feels like on yourself. And so right from the beginning, all of our understanding is empathetic.

There is no awareness of the world which isn't also assimilating the empathetic view of others

that you feel their need for justice the same way you feel it for yourself.

And that's one of the things that has to be educated out of people, the tendency to feel unity with everyone you know

because you wouldn't have a proper acquisitive behavior. You wouldn't fit into a society in which inequality is a virtue.

Did you know that all doctors, at least in the United States, undergo special training to teach them not to empathize with their patients?

I couldn't believe it.

Yeah, they do because the premise that's given is that, look, if you're a doctor and you're treating some pretty sick people

and they all start dying, very soon you'll get horribly depressed and commit suicide.

Speaking of suicide, did you know that doctors have the highest suicide rate of any profession?

Yeah, I've heard that.

Yeah. And the second thing is my question, I guess it's a question. Do you think that analytical thought,

which is so heavily emphasized and drilled literally into everybody's head since they started going to school,

do you think that that process is under the control of serotonin somehow?

Yeah, serotonin creates basically fear and anxiety and withdrawal.

Education really is designed to change our organism towards a follow the leader, follow instructions kind of behavior.

The reason I'm asking is that it's one of the very common symptoms in people with depression,

which we know it's driven by serotonin, is that they tend to overanalyze almost every situation

and they're being taught by their psychiatrist to ignore the inputs from the environment.

They're saying, the psychiatrist says, "No, you don't need to worry about the world around you.

Just figure out things in your head because depression is all in your head."

And I'm thinking that's exactly the opposite of what the patient should be doing.

They should be opening themselves up to the world instead of shutting down, right?

Yeah, the world is constantly there to stream into you with newness.

Any contact with the world tends to be exhilarating and it's only the essentially learned helplessness

that makes people turn inward and detach from the environment and its stimulating properties, particularly other people.

So if we could switch to coronavirus, Georgie, unless you have any other questions.

No, I'm fine.

Okay, can I do a quick summary here?

When you're talking about the coronavirus increasing angiotensin and hypertensive symptoms and things like that,

the virus itself is real and it has been studied, but people testing positive is completely a facade.

Is that right?

The numbers and things like that, because there's no accurate test, that is a total, I don't know, chicanery or whatever.

Is that right to say or no?

Yeah, they're causing, calling everything that tests on one test or another, if it tests positive, they're calling that a case.

But case always has meant a case of sickness, but a case of positivity on a test,

it's dishonest to call it a case when it's only a test.

And the test, if it's very accurate in finding some of the nucleic acid or protein of the virus,

it doesn't mean that you have reacted to the virus at all.

And if you've reacted to it, it doesn't mean that you have had any sickness reaction at all.

It simply means that the virus has been detected and the people who are susceptible to getting sick from that sort of virus,

this particular kind of coronavirus happens to attach to the ACE2 enzyme,

which is a proteolytic enzyme that destroys angiotensin.

And so if there is a huge amount of the virus circulating, if you have reproduced it,

and there's a lot of it in your bloodstream, it will be inactivating the proteolytic enzyme that destroys the inflammatory angiotensin.

So the virus is capable of turning on your inflammatory system.

Everything that angiotensin acts on will be released and intensified

until you have the resources to turn off angiotensin, for example, progesterone.

And carbon dioxide will counteract the effects of angiotensin.

And so the process of getting sick from coronavirus simply doesn't happen

if you have the proper physiological response to increasing angiotensin,

which is to increase your carbon dioxide and progesterone, turn off the inflammation at the base.

I guess what I'm saying is like if the tests are so inaccurate,

like what you're saying is almost like a moot point because nobody can know for sure if they even have this thing.

Is that right? Or is that too much of a stretch?

No, it's okay to find out that you have the virus sitting on your nasal membranes or wherever,

but if it's there and you haven't got sick, that's just the normal.

80% of the people don't bother getting sick when it's present

because they have enough progesterone and carbon dioxide and not too much PUFA.

Linoleic acid is required for the virus to take on its virulent shape.

Did you see the recent article in the British Medical Journal?

It was more of an opinion, but actually an article as well that showed, I mean,

I guess three main points that really struck me.

For me, that was the last nail in the coffin of the whole COVID thing.

Number one, 20 to 50% of people have pre-existing immunity to that thing.

So the whole thing about this being a novel virus, or maybe it is a novel virus,

but the article says, look, it's so similar to other coronaviruses that just like the swine flu,

which apparently also was discovered that most people have up to 60% have actually pre-existing immunity.

Now we're seeing 20 to 50% of people around the world have already pre-existing immunity to this virus.

The other thing the article notices that most of the people that had pre-existing immunity,

they had no antibodies.

So this means that the whole antibody test may be bogus in terms of determining immunity to this virus,

which immediately made me think, hold on a second.

Most of the flu vaccines and literally any vaccines against the virus,

when they undergo clinical trials, they rely on the antibody test to say,

oh, this vaccine is working, you're now immune to this virus.

But this study is now saying, no, actually antibodies are really not very reliable.

It's T cell reactivity, which should be looked at,

and almost nobody is looking at that because the tests are much more expensive.

But it may turn out that we are immune to a majority of the viruses that are in circulation

simply because they're so similar to each other, at least they're groups of viruses that we've all been exposed to,

and we may have a significant pre-existing immunity to most of the viruses that are in circulation right now,

even if they're slightly different from each other.

What do you think of that?

That should stimulate a reconsideration of the whole 115 years of medical immunology theory,

but I don't think it will.

The whole history, starting with Paul Ehrlich and his lock and key thing,

and equating his chemical toxins with antibodies, that whole thing is bogus.

The real immune system is everything in the organism that makes it able to stay healthy

in the presence of things that could possibly make it sick.

But his dye, mercury compounds, various organic chemical treatments that he equated

to the lock and key antibody androgen reaction, that happens, but it isn't what makes us immune.

It's a horrible chemical commercial ploy to sell products, absolutely lacking science,

should start with cells such as T-cells and all of the different white blood cell-like,

resin tissue cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, a whole range of things that don't produce antibodies

but that are essential for maintaining good health.

Those things are the real immune system, but to understand them,

you have to understand the whole physiology, and it's easier to think in terms of lock and key

and something you can buy from a pharmaceutical monopoly.

So as far as the antibodies, I also thought, there's something else here though.

For some diseases that are viral, actually having a high antibody titer, it's a really bad sign.

The hepatitis viruses and I think HIV are a prime example.

You don't want, I mean, this is a sign you may die soon if you have very high levels of antibodies.

How did they manage to sell the fraud of certain viral diseases, it's good to have antibodies too,

but for others it's not? Have they ever explained that publicly?

No, they don't like to talk about evidence unless it can be fitted into the lock and key idea.

Progesterone is considered an immune suppressant,

but that's because it limits our antibody production where estrogen drives furious production of antibodies,

but limits estrogen destroys our thymus if it's dominant.

Progesterone can regenerate the thymus.

What it's doing is reducing the potentially autoimmune anti-survival antibody system

and promoting the thymocentric innate resistance system,

reducing inflammation while allowing regeneration and restoration.

You just gave me a great insight saying that estrogen increases the production of antibodies.

As you well know, since estrogen is involved in many of the blood cancers like lymphomas, leukemias, etc.,

is it the high estrogen that's making these people that have these cancers

very often have very high antibodies to viruses like the J.C. virus or the Epstein bivirus?

It's really the high estrogen that's causing this, not the virus causing the leukemia.

Yeah, I think so. Lots of people get convinced that they have chronic Epstein-Barr problems.

It's the estrogen driving their antibody-producing system wild, and what they need is progesterone.

I've seen cases diagnosed as fairly serious, if not terminal, lupus, for example,

clear up overnight or within a week of using progesterone simply by restoring the balance

between progesterone and estrogen, gets rid of that wild production of antibodies.

Are any other steroids that may have similar effect, like maybe cortisol, that increases the antibody production?

Well, it destroys the thymus-type cell processes. It shrinks the thymus gland the way estrogen does.

So it tends to leave the antibody system working.

I see.

Ray, maybe we could switch gears a little bit and maybe speculate about the endgame of coronavirus.

I've been watching a person's channel named IceAgeFarmer, and he's been documenting the destruction of food warehouses

and telling farmers that they can't have cows or they have to kill their animals and things like that.

So he was basically pulling from the Rockefellers' own information that part of this renovation of society

involved the renovation of the food system. So I could go on here, but what do you think about that?

That fits perfectly and tightly, seamlessly with the digital money program that was tried out in India,

killing lots of people. I noticed that the Rockefeller Foundation, the Gates Foundation,

and the World Economic Forum are now collaborating on changing India and all of Africa to digital money.

And if that happens, you don't have to destroy the food supply to get it under total monopoly control.

You'll have everyone's purchasing power under your central control.

Simply turn off their bank account if they don't behave. You don't have to kill their cows.

Aren't they maybe kind of doing that in China already?

I haven't been investigating that. I don't know.

So the second thing I wanted to bring up was James Corbett put out a video called "Coronavirus and Climate Change."

And so again, tying this into the old narrative, and James kind of comically says, "It's silent. It's invisible.

It's spreading everywhere. It's going to kill us all. We have to take extraordinary measures to combat it."

Coronavirus? No, silly. It's carbon dioxide.

And then Bill Gates on his blog, this was a little while ago, he said, "COVID-19 is awful. Climate change could be worse."

So clearly, the WHO and Gates and other people are just kind of seeding this into the current narrative.

Do you think that's going to take shape in the form of the endgame, like maybe climate lockdowns or things, something like that?

Yeah, they're getting away with a nonsense virus pandemic.

And if people ever catch on that the whole thing is fraudulent, they'll have to come up with something new.

So they could come back with an acute climate problem.

Actually, they're blaming the fires on the Pacific Coast on climate change,

but the climate change is really being driven by the 100 years or more clear-cutting,

destroying the forests, which were the climate moderators.

The forests were responsible for the moderate amount of rainfall that sustained those forests.

When they clear-cut them and at the same time began draining lakes and rivers into cities,

the clear-cutting destroyed the soil, started depleting the underground water,

and that added to the clear-cutting to destroy forests more quickly, dehydrating the whole region.

And now the clear-cutting has changed the climate, and the dryness itself is stimulating the spread of fires,

which increases the destruction of vegetation.

And it's a self-stimulating desertification process, but it has nothing to do with carbon dioxide.

What do you think about the idea that the directed energy weapons are causing the fires?

Around 1970, when they were about to cut the last of the ancient forests,

a few of tiny miniature forests were set aside from logging.

But at the same time, the idea of salvage logging, if there was a forest fire,

was introduced just within a year of setting aside these ancient forests.

And as soon as that happened, arson apparently, because it's really the only logical explanation

for why forest fires suddenly started in these set-aside, no-logging areas.

But with the new law, they could rush in, even before the fire was out,

they could rush in and start cutting trees, even trees that weren't burned,

justified by the fact that there was a fire.

So arson, at least in some of the well-forested areas, has obviously been the cause of the fires.

There are probably many causes.

The government used to have lookouts who could see every part of the forested country,

Washington, Oregon, and California, from mountaintops.

The Forest Service is now renting those out for $80 or $100 a night to tourists

because they don't have forest watchers.

Now the idea of fire watchers, the people who stand around evacuating populations

in front of the fires, they're our current concept of fire watchers.

They watch the fire burn rather than watching.

The policy for 40 years or so was called the 10 a.m. policy.

On the day following the sighting of a fire, they had to have it out by 10 a.m. the following day.

Now they watch it.

Justified, the story was that the Indians used to preserve the forest by allowing controlled burns

to get rid of the underbrush.

But after 100 years of destroying the forest, they said, "Let's be ecological

and have permissive forest fires. Let the fire burn."

But what they have is these dehydrated, highly flammable, no longer native forests

that create very destructive forest fires that are only valuable to the salvage loggers.

So the policy now is let it burn.

Our local fire started in one of these set-aside wilderness areas called the Opal Creek Wilderness.

They knew it was burning for a month.

It started August 16th, and it happened that huge winds came up

after they'd been watching it burn in the wilderness area by this new policy.

That allowed it to spread into these vast fires that have ruined the air

for the whole western part of the U.S.

Do you expect these targeted disasters that are going to be blamed on climate change to contribute to...

What's the point of these disasters?

Maybe if it's arson, are they trying to move people to a certain area?

Are they trying to get them out of the suburbs or something?

What's your take?

Oh yeah, the overall policy is to change the whole economy,

get rid of any hint of self-sufficient economic activity,

and turn everyone into a potential employee, make room for useful eaters.

If someone chooses not to be useful in their system,

then their fate probably isn't going to be much better than what the Nazis did with their useless eaters.

To make people destitute, what are they going to do with all these people?

Are they going to round them up in something?

I know this is a dark subject, but what do you think?

Yeah, there are thousands and thousands of homeless people in Portland and Eugene,

and they've been herding them around, moving them in places that are less conspicuous.

Not doing anything to help them, but keep them from being a nuisance or spectacle.

I remember, wasn't there a storm in Texas, and they cleared out Walmarts and kept people in there against their will?

Stuff like that is probably in our future, or happening right now in Portland.

Yeah, there will be more unemployed and homeless people as soon as the moratorium on foreclosures comes to an end.

I can't see any alternative except a huge expansion of the homeless population.

It's possible to survive living in a cardboard box with a plastic shield against the rain,

but it isn't going to create a stable population.

Within 20 years, it will have meant a reduction of the population.

Go ahead, Jorge.

In terms of reducing the population and turning the useless eaters into useful eaters,

what do you think the process would look like?

Right now, a useless eater is a person who is self-sufficient, and they're trying to make them into useful eaters,

which means entirely dependent on the powers that be. Is that your usage of the word?

Yeah, a cog in the wheel, whatever the machine is that they intend to have operating.

I can't really visualize how they foresee this artificial intelligence guided society to be working 50 years from now.

But if we're moving more and more towards centralization and automation,

even if you turn all of the useless eaters into useful eaters, these people are largely useless anyways, right?

What are they going to do? They don't really have jobs for all these people.

I know that's why I can't foresee any viable future for the reset economy of the World Economic Forum.

Now most people are employed. Someone is making lots of profit for having billions of people making junk,

useless electronic gadgets to keep the people occupied and being willing to work.

As long as there's money to be extracted, this system is working, but it isn't self-sustaining.

It requires constantly pumping resources in from the empire.

Once Africa and South America have been mined to the limit, they're simply going to have to either rethink the whole program

or eliminate vast amounts of the population.

The whole imperial World Economic Forum program is currently based on the empire,

and it's getting essentially free raw materials and extremely cheap labor to sell to anyone who has the money to buy it.

What about very rural areas? America is a large country, and while I could see the authorities rounding people up

and roughing them up in big cities and maybe suburbs, what about the Great Heartland in between?

Do you think they'll just have the army sweep through the country and make sure that there's no rural areas where people are self-sufficient?

If these people are left to their own devices, they'll figure out how to survive. They'll start a chicken farm or a goat farm or a cow farm.

I guess the empire must have some kind of a plan of preventing that or getting rid of it if people take matters into their own hands.

They already have all of these levels of local, state, county, city, government trained to be integrated with the military and the plans, the economic plans.

All kinds of minor officials have been contacted by the Homeland Security to participate in their anti-terrorist programs and so on.

So they're ready to deal with anyone who starts guerrilla chicken farms or potato farms or whatever.

They'll get Ruby Ridged.

So how are they going to – I mean, let's say there are existing farms right now.

I guess it's just me. I just have a hard time imagining that a local sheriff in rural Alabama will round up his deputies and start walking around and shooting people's chickens and cows and animals that are already existing.

I mean, if these things already exist, there either has to be a program of getting rid of it in order to make people desperate, or these people will not be desperate.

They'll continue thriving on their own.

In the '30s, they did exactly that. They sent the military or police out to wipe out vast amounts of pigs and chickens and fruit and vegetables, destroying and burying huge amounts of food to increase the price of food,

to start investment coming back.

That was done supposedly to get employment increasing.

It was actually the coming war that increased employment and stopped the Depression.

But they did it with a supposedly good intention of restoring the economy.

Now they'll have other reasons for convincing any organized shooting-capable force, state police or county police or whatever, to do the Ruby Ridge sort of thing,

to identify the independent co-ops as terrorist dangers.

And then they'll have pretext because the animals will have COVID-19, and so therefore the people will be harboring killer virus animals, and they'll be, like you said, they'll be considered terrorists.

And I'm sure there'll be a media campaign against these people as well, if you're just a homesteader.

Yeah, in the 1930s while the government was doing that official destruction of resources,

the corporations had their goons out burning down alternative newspapers, burning out co-ops of various sorts, consumer co-ops and producer co-ops.

They would last a few months and then they would be destroyed by corporate employees.

So do you think, I mean I'm sure you've seen it, there are some areas in the country that have extremely strong anti-government attitudes, including at the local law enforcement level.

Some of these sheriffs, some of the state police, they seem to be much more strongly tied to their local communities than to the central, to the federal or the state government.

You don't think that some of these people, their loyalty may switch when they see what's going on, or do you think they'll be, they'll have a way of forcing the local law enforcement to play ball?

At some point the empire necessarily has to fail when it reaches the limit of what it can extract from the colonies.

And when the empire totally fails, then we can expect intelligence to erupt in unexpected places, including such things as rural police.

Okay, but you're saying for now there's, you know, there's still, I guess they're so, they've been so indoctrinated due to the constant exchange of know-how and weapons with the military that I guess the, and I'm sure the federal government is putting a tremendous effort into making sure this continues,

that most of the local law enforcement is sort of like heavily dependent for their jobs on the federal government, which uses this dependency to indoctrinate and provide weapons and whatnot in return for some sense of loyalty.

Yeah, and they're just very, very heavily indoctrinated with the ideology that the big economy has to be preserved.

Do you think China is also trying to be the next empire or do you think they have a more different idea of, for the future?

I think historically they would be satisfied to be self-sufficient, but they are historically very good business dealers, better than Trump at making deals.

And so I think they're almost necessarily going to be a new economic empire, even if they don't have to enforce it with the military, the way the US has.

They're already succeeding faster than the US is, despite the US having hundreds of military bases everywhere.

Armenia and Azerbaijan, so that they've got Russia and China even more encircled than before with their colonized agents.

As they say, when the bank robber runs out of banks to rob, the bank robber's lifestyle necessarily has to suffer. Do you think we're getting to that point or do you think there's still some leeway to go?

Oh yeah, it can go on for easily 10 or 15 years, but things get less and less stable. So I think the opportunity for opting out of the system, people are seeing the possibilities more and more.

Almost two hours, so maybe I can read these super chats and maybe I can ask you just one question since it's on my mind.

Desiccated liver tablets have become extremely popular, Ray, and you wrote to somebody, "Desiccated liver contains oxidized tryptophan, cysteine, vitamin A, ubuquinone, and many other harmful things."

Can you unpack that and maybe just talk a little bit more about that? If somebody hates liver, is it harmful to eat those desiccated pills versus trying to make a pate or some other form of liver?

What you'll get will be a few B vitamins that are fairly stable and lots of iron and also lots of potentially irritating or toxic breakdown products of all of those highly oxidizable compounds.

Vitamin A in the process of oxidizing can catalyze all kinds of attacks on surrounding materials.

So oxidizing the vitamin A could destroy some of the otherwise stable B vitamins. So it's not really a very logical way to get your liver.

Eggs have many of the same nutrients in a lower concentration, and so eggs would be the next best substitute rather than dehydrated liver.

Yeah, a lot of the carnivore people are cashing out on desiccated liver supplements. The beef liver, the freeze-dried, that is the process you're talking about. That's what creates all the harmful and oxidized products. Is that right?

Yeah. If you carefully defat it to start with, get rid of buprequinone and vitamin A and vitamin D and K and so on, some of the most useful things in the liver, then you can dehydrate it and have a good vitamin B complex, however, with lots of iron.

Speaking of iron, one last question for me and then I'll read the super chat. Georgie, if you had other questions. Does the formation of gray hair always involve an excess of iron, or could that oxy stress or reductive stress, could that be from some other instigator?

Yeah, radiation. I think people often get white whiskers where they've had dental x-rays just because the x-rays destroy so much of the apparatus.

Iron probably goes into the, when iron is circulating in the body, it will probably settle into the damaged pigment-forming copper-containing enzymes that have lost their copper.

So even though excess iron wasn't necessarily the cause of the whitening, it's likely to show up as a presence associated with the white hair.

So, it's sort of like in an area with toxic metals, you'll find aluminum in the Alzheimer's brain, but the aluminum gets there just because the Alzheimer's process normally would be from the buildup of calcium under stress and lactic acid production and so on.

But if you're exposed to aluminum, it'll out-compete the calcium in some of the places.

The same way with the iron, it isn't necessarily the cause, but it'll be associated with it very often.

Okay, with that, it's been two hours, so Ray, I'll let you go. Let me just read these names of the people that donated the Super Chats.

Unfortunately, guys, I'd love to ask Ray all these questions, but we would just be on here for hours. So I told Ray I'd only keep him for two hours.

So, John Rowan for $10, thank you so much. Benji for $5, thank you so much. Marcello for $20, thank you so much.

Christina Tomaj for $24.99, thank you so much, Christina. XR for Australian $7.99, thank you so much.

Michael for $100, thank you, Michael. Sincerely appreciate it for that, right to Ray. Janet Pak for $200, thank you so much.

Oh, these are short. Michael says, "Thank you for inspiring the minds of Danny and Georgie." I think that was you, Ray.

Janet says, "Thank you so much for taking the time to share all this knowledge." Were there any other ones? I was kidding.

Okay, let me keep going here. Michelle for $50, wow, thank you so much for your thought-provoking discourse. Thank you, Michelle.

Harry Burgos for $25, thank you so much, Harry. Kathleen Stewart for $49.99, thank you so much, Kathleen.

She says, "Thank you, Dr. Peat." And Helena for $20 Australian says, "Thank you, Danny." Thank you, Dr. Peat.

Danny and Georgie, always interesting and informative listening.

Okay, Ray, can you let everybody know how to subscribe to your newsletter?

Its address is raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And then the status of your book?

You can find that at the same address.

Go ahead, Ray, I cut you off.

The books are all available digitally, but some are still available on paper.

And then what newsletter are you working on right now?

Lactic acid, pretty much the stuff we've been talking about tonight.

Nice. And Georgie, any parting words?

I had one more question for Ray, if he has the time.

Ray, are you familiar with quinine, the alkaloid present in tonic water, the one that gives a bitter taste?

I've tasted it and I've read about how the FDA has been abusing it by turning it into a proprietary, super-expensive drug instead of a natural herbal remedy.

But I don't really know much about how it works.

The hydroxychloroquine, which is basically a synthetic derivative of quinine, right?

Yeah.

The reason I'm asking is, first, in regards to COVID, there's a recent study that came out that showed that quinine was actually 10 times more effective without any cell toxicity in killing the COVID, the coronavirus,

and both preventing the virus from entering the cell and stopping an already existing infection.

So I thought that's pretty remarkable.

And again, it shows how FDA can bastardize pretty much anything good that the world provides just for the purpose of making money.

But the reason I'm asking is that if you look further into quinine on PubMed,

there are a number of pretty interesting studies showing that it depletes tryptophan similar to the way – well, it actually has similar effect to the drug fanclonib, parachlorophenylalanine.

But instead of inhibiting the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, somehow the quinine is capable of depleting tryptophan inside of the cell and basically making it deficient in serotonin.

And on top of that, apparently it's acting similar to the drug cyproheptadine, and it also blocks the serotonin receptors.

So I thought that those effects were remarkable because I don't know of any other chemical that has such effects.

So I was wondering if you've seen anything, but if you haven't, that's fine.

That convinces me to try some tonic water.

Yes, me too.

Apparently the British, when they were drinking tonic water while they were colonizing India,

they were drinking tonic water that was not ruined by FDA's regulations, so it had a much higher amount of quinine.

I think right now FDA limits it to about 85 milligrams per liter,

while the British were drinking it in a concentration of 300 to 500 milligrams per liter,

and they were guzzling this all day with no ill effects, it seems.

So they managed to conquer entire India and survive malaria and many other diseases.

Ray, I swear this is the absolute last thing. I can't believe we didn't talk about this.

But your two-minute thoughts on Trump getting coronavirus?

I have no opinion whatsoever.

You don't think it's 4-D chess or anything?

I'm not convinced that he even has anything.

It would be politically opportune to get it, but I don't think it matters very much one way or the other.

Interesting.

It might take a little away from his, since he said he was using hydroxyquinone,

it might deflate his publicity for it a little.

Awesome. We can talk about this a little bit more next time, as I'm sure this will develop.

Guys, please give this episode a like. We do not show up in the search of YouTube.

In fact, Ray, I did that food video and had your name in it.

If you type in "Ray Peat," the video doesn't even show up on YouTube search, which is just awesome.

I love that.

But anyways, Ray, thank you so much. It's always special having you on.

I sincerely appreciate it.

Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much, my partner in crime.

Thank you, everybody listening, the audience of this show, although small, is extremely interactive

and always throwing out good ideas.

So I sincerely appreciate it.

Engaged is the word I was looking for.

Guys, thank you so much.

Ray, have a safe time in Oregon, Eugene, right now, and Georgi, I'll talk to you soon.

Thank you, everybody, for listening. Take care, everyone.

Okay, thanks.

Bye, Ray.

Thank you.

Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat

with measures that are defensive.

Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base

and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

What if free people could live secure in the knowledge

that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack,

that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles

before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?

I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished by the time we reach the surface.

Victor Technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this year,

may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

Piloting the space shuttle is very difficult to do, one would think.

Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk, can take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor

and poured beer all over the counter.

The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

Now, okay, Georgi Dinkov, Mr. Ray and Peat, how are you guys?

Thank you for joining us. Thank you everybody in the chat.

Georgi Dinkov, how are you?

I'm all right, you know, living a few blocks away from the White House,

hoping DC will not get burned down in the next two weeks.

And Ray, are you living life without a mask in Oregon?

I haven't had a mask on for weeks.

I got a face shield,

I thought I was going to use it to go to the bank,

but the bank was no longer admitting even mask wearer,

so I didn't get a chance to try out my plastic face shield.

Was that because of the dust and the things,

or was that a requirement for the bank?

No, the state governor said that you could wear a face shield instead of a mask.

I was just going to see if the stores or banks actually would follow her orders

because the bank seemed so crazily panicked,

but I didn't get a chance to try them.

So you're opting to do that because of the negative health effects from a mask,

or just not enjoying wearing one?

Yeah, just not wanting to wear a mask.

Having a piece of plastic two inches in front of your face doesn't disturb anything.

One of the crazy things, like in Mexico,

the people that seem to be the most affected seem to be the lowest socioeconomic individuals.

The people cleaning the Jardin are suffering so badly wearing a mask when it's extremely hot outside.

Somebody in San Francisco might not think it's a big deal to go to the shop and wear a mask,

but you've got to think about people that are suffering big time.

Yeah.

Okay, so Georgie, you have some questions just about life in general,

and then we can kind of move on to, we were talking about respiration

and kind of going step by step in the last few live streams about just the stress system

and all the work that Ray has done, but Georgie, I'll let you take the reins.

Yeah, my question is, Ray, I'm sure you've seen the news that they found water on the moon,

and also they found phosphine on Venus,

and there have been news over the last five or ten years that they found vitamin B3 and glycine in outer space.

So, especially when it comes to phosphine, the consensus, if we believe it,

says that phosphine cannot really, they don't know of any inorganic process that is capable of creating phosphine.

All the processes on Earth seem to involve life.

Do you think that suggests that maybe life forms on Venus and other planets as well?

Very possible, but I don't think they have a broad enough conception of what life is.

I think there are probably life equivalents that have gone down very different routes for making organisms.

I think of it as a basic reflex of being, of matter itself, that is a starting point of life.

And you can go off in an infinite number of directions,

except as limited by those innate impulses intrinsic to matter.

So, I would not limit my possibilities to thinking that organisms had to have been the source.

Okay, so what would be a good test for life, I mean, considering that our ideas so far about life,

well not ours, but scientific ideas about life are so limited?

Oh, I think it has to be an inductive kind of perceptual reason.

Watch something and see what happens.

So, if it basically displays pattern recognition qualities that would classify as consciousness, basically?

Yeah, self-organizing and generating order out of disorder.

Right, but it's not at all limited to the physical manifestations that we're familiar with here on Earth, right?

Right, right. I think you could imagine processes that are more like a layer of matter that keeps reorganizing itself in all directions,

but without separating off in the individual organisms.

Okay.

My picture of a solid substance is very similar to everything we think of as life.

In a metal, you have the little magnetic domains, the crystal forming domains, the passage of time and energy through the metal,

like if the metal bends back and forth, these domains will interact and build up and form crack possibilities.

And similar domains to the little magnetic domains, for example, if you hammer a magnet,

it gradually loses magnetism unless it's in a magnetic field,

but just hammering a piece of iron in the Earth's magnetic field,

the iron will rearrange itself and form a big magnet because those little domains are constantly ready to respond to their environment.

And I think there are electric domains, even though the metal seems to be conducting as a whole or a unit,

I think there are electronic domains on a small scale that define properties such as photoelectric properties.

And all of these intrinsically organizing subunits of something that seems to be a mere mass of an element,

all of these have lifelike properties.

So I would see granite, for example, as intending to become more alive.

So basically, if we can talk of any generic requirements for life, it would be some form of a self-directed, self-controlled, autonomous electron flow?

Yeah, exactly.

Okay. But then again, the shape, if we can say the shape of that life form would be context specific.

It would be different depending on where you're looking at, right? Saturn would have a different life form, Venus would do…

Yeah, because all of these things like the iron you hammer in the Earth's field, it's taking on…

nature is developing in relation to its environment.

And I think that's always happening.

Everything on some level knows where it is in the world, not only where but when.

So the awareness of process, everything really is not only needing to be defined in terms of everything in its momentary environment,

but in the tendency of the environment to be changing in a certain direction.

Okay. Well, according to this discussion we had, then all of these approaches that NASA has to finding life seem hopelessly obsolete.

They're just looking for something that looks like bacteria no matter where they send their probes.

So it means like it's kind of stupid to do that.

Exactly. They're ideologues as to what life is and if you look at what they dogmatically believe a cell is,

you have to say that the whole enterprise is stupid. Even as they try to understand bacteria on Earth,

they're committed to impossible doctrines.

So naturally, if they look for something that doesn't quite exist on Earth, they're likely to be missing everything interesting.

What do you make out of the reports that the original Voyager probes that went to Mars in the 1970s

apparently initially reported that they found organic life forms there,

but then I guess the powers that be quickly decided that it was a mistake, that the sensors weren't properly calibrated.

Yeah, I think that happens all the time.

Okay.

The raw data everywhere is more into official conclusion like the Michelson-Morley experiment.

The textbooks insist that they didn't find an ether drift, but it's very clear in their data

and in the follow-up studies over the next 20 or 30 years, it kept being confirmed.

The establishment periodically subsidizes someone to shoot down the alternative interpretations

just because they were close to the actual recorded data isn't sufficient.

They violate the paradigm and so have to be destroyed.

Do you think the discovery of life outside of Earth may have some sort of a politically destabilizing effect

that may trigger a collapse of the current fake ideas and that's maybe why,

even if they have been discovered, we haven't heard anything about them?

Yeah, it's exactly the same sort of thing that led to Gilbert Ling being isolated and absolutely walled off from the whole scientific world.

You mentioned Halton Arp a bunch of times.

If what he found was taken seriously, that would lead to a reimagining of everything, right?

Yeah, Fred Soddy, the isotope guy, Fred Soddy in his actual writings was a very interesting person

who believed in continuing creation in empty space and exactly harmonizing with Halton Arp.

So the continuous creation would be, in the Electric Universe theory lingo,

would be the creation of charged particles out of neutrinos under the effects of the electrical force.

Is that right?

Yeah, that's their idea, but Halton Arp or Fred Soddy believed that cosmic rays represented newly created atoms.

Halton Arp was seeing these clouds, the red shifted clouds attached to an old looking galaxy.

I think he was seeing the concentrated newly formed matter and Halton Arp was suggesting that

the stray bits of it that didn't condense in a new red shifted galaxy,

that we're seeing newly created matter constantly streaming through the world.

So what would be the process that creates that new matter?

Is that like the high intensity, the energetic intensity of a star?

Yeah, and they argued that it was the passage of time itself, the asymmetry of being,

that time is a property of matter getting richer and more in quantity, improving its complexity and mass even.

No one ever really attempted to argue against his reasoning that there was simply the assumption of 160 years ago

that time must be symmetrical, that there must be the possibility of time going in the other direction,

but it just doesn't make sense.

There was a mathematical physics professor at the University of Oregon who believed he could explain

the nuclear fission and lots of things in terms of particles coming from the future,

coming backwards in time and hitting present things,

but no one has rationally tried to deconstruct Cozy Roof's view that matter is asymmetrical

in the sense of always getting later and that passage of time in asymmetry is adding information and energy to the universe constantly.

Okay. In those original Dudley papers about the neutrino sea,

I think I remember him saying that he thought that the neutrinos were created inside stars.

Do you remember that paragraph?

Not that particular paragraph, but that would overlap nicely with Cozy Roof's time.

Cozy Roof said matter is being, or energy is being created in relation to the mass,

and his predictions of planetary internal energy have been confirmed fairly recently

even in terms of the big gaseous planets.

Everything is fitting his scheme of heat production internally in proportion to their mass,

and he worked it out for stellar energy in terms of mass,

but then applied it to the Earth's internal heat and was looking to test it in the dark of the moon

when he saw red eruptions on the moon, and that has been confirmed repeatedly,

but it was denied just because it violated the conservation of matter and energy at such a radical level.

Yeah, I was just about to ask you, if matter is created constantly and energy increases proportionally,

wouldn't that immediately violate the conservation of matter and also the second law of thermodynamics?

Yeah, but he pointed out that that was all deduced from Christian beliefs about the creation of the universe.

Understood, understood.

In one of your interviews with Danny, you talked about Lennon and basically the idea of memory versus matter,

and you said that matter is basically, and that's what Lennon said apparently,

is that matter is nothing except what we can know and become, but we don't know where matter is coming from.

Is that maybe the ultimate unanswerable question, where is matter coming from?

Yeah, I think all of these people have given a rational side of the answer that neutrinos appearing according to the mass of the matter,

that and Kozyrev's projection of stellar energy in terms of mass,

or cosmic rays being the earliest form of matter coming into existence with kinetic energy as part of their inheritance from the nature of matter.

I think the process of knowing where matter comes from will involve getting a grasp on what the nature of a neutrino is,

and what electrons and protons and neutrons are, and all of their potentialities.

I think a picture will emerge that has a more satisfying answer to why is matter emitting energy and becoming greater in complexity and mass.

The physicist David Bohm thought that there's a creative principle in the universe, and he was I guess repeating what Aristotle said as well.

Do you think that that creative principle may be what's responsible for this constant stream of matter into existence?

Yep. That's just another way of talking about the same thing.

The next development of man, a banker wrote a series of books on alternate views of physics,

and what was his name? White. Lancelot Law White. He was looking for that same principle that Bohm called the creative principle,

or the causier of called time, and the empirical things that Halton Arp saw. I think they're all talking about exactly the same thing.

So when humans exercise their creative principles, such as paintings or creating music or doing any kind of creative activity,

do you think we're doing something akin to creating energy, creating matter?

I think of consciousness as a sort of electronic gel inside the brain.

It has different properties according to the chemical and biological energy of the cells,

but consciousness is electronic in nature like an excited cloud that is simply resting on the living substance

and functioning to integrate the living substance, but it has its intrinsic rules of energy.

When it's operating at a low energy, some people for example will never dream in anything but words or symbols.

Others will only dream in monochromatic images.

People who have had a very happy life, not too much stress, will have more satisfying full sensory polychromatic dreams,

and their thought processes will be similarly able to be relatively free floating so that you can imagine things kinesthetically

and involving all of the sensory properties in forming images that make your thought processes tend to stay very close to empirical reality,

but that we're helping the universe to generate the possibilities for the next step of substantial change.

The energy is reaching a point where it can guide the organism to make the decisions that will allow a richer biological life,

further supporting the range of the mental creative qualities.

Are you familiar with the sensory deprivation experiments that started out in the 60s I think by the CIA

where they put people into these completely soundproof and lightproof rooms in complete darkness and silence,

and then within a few minutes people start to basically dream while awake?

Yeah. Anyone can do it if they just pay attention.

Many times I've asked people what they see when they close their eyes, and they usually say, "What do you mean? You don't see anything when your eyes are closed."

But if you say, "Well, don't you see black or red or something?"

Lots of people will deny that they see blackness when they close their eyes.

So would you say that this is an indication of basically the brain's constant need to create through dreams?

Yeah. Once you start doing it, you see that there's stuff going on.

It isn't just the color of your eyelids or darkness that you're seeing.

You're looking into your brain, and the brain is constantly playing around producing all sorts of things.

If you happen to notice something interesting pass by in your attention, then you can direct your attention to it.

It's like tuning in on a very rich TV.

According to the way you tune, you can get more and more information, sort of a hypertext of imagery.

I'll put myself out there, but I'll see fractal patterns and big circular objects that seem like electric sometimes passing by.

Then I've noticed taking things like progesterone and thyroid seem to calm down the fractal patterns. Is that...?

Yeah, you can get perfect blackness if you are very calm and in the dream-ready state.

The background should be able to quiet down into total blackness.

It's a very impressive darkness that you don't necessarily notice at night or in a cave.

It's the internal quietness of your retina and brain.

As soon as you are active in any sense, then you start seeing thoughts and dreams.

One other thing for me. I've noticed this since I was a little kid.

If I lay down and press on my eyes, it almost seems like a psychedelic type of show.

Does that make any kind of sense?

Then it will disappear when I stop pressing them or if I open my eyes.

I won't be able to duplicate it, then I'll have to wait until the next day to do the same thing.

Am I making any sense?

Sure. It's creating stimulus inflow on your retina and that activates your visual center of the brain.

Those who are going back and forth all the time...

Did I ever tell you the experiment that they did with chickens putting electrodes at the back of their eyeballs

and showing them different images?

When they showed them a checkerboard pattern, they would get a checkerboard pattern in the pickups on the back of the retina.

When they took the eyeball out and were still measuring at the end of the optic nerve, it became totally quiet.

The chickens weren't seeing anything and the electrodes didn't pick up anything.

But they gave them LSD and started getting all kinds of complicated imagery at the outer end of the optic nerve.

That shows that chickens at rest aren't projecting thoughts out into the world.

But when you test a similar thing by putting an image onto a floating contact lens projector

so that the image becomes fixed on the retina, in just two or three seconds of complete fixation,

one of the images blanks out and there will be recurring flashes every five or ten seconds.

First the image is perceived, then it disappears, then there are waves where it comes back.

If it's a basically random image, a squiggly line, that quickly disappears and doesn't come back.

You become blind to that random pattern.

But if superimposed on that squiggly line, there is some familiar shape like the letter B or number 4,

something that we're exposed to very frequently.

All of the squiggly lines disappear, but the retina stays sensitized

and continues to see the images that are meaningful to the brain,

indicating the brain is meaningfully re-energizing and sensitizing the retina.

But ordinarily the retina is fatigued and stops seeing an immobile pattern of stimulation.

So it shows that people are constantly activating their retina from the brain with endodromic impulses.

So basically the dreaming is during the day external impulses are imprinting patterns on our retina,

and at night when the stimulus is no longer there,

the brain basically goes into free creative mode in juxtaposing all of these images?

And does it project them back to the retina? Is that what we see them when we're dreaming?

Yeah, not necessarily.

The LSD type dream tends to be like perceiving luminosity in space,

but it can concentrate on the retina.

And you can tell the difference.

Salvador Dali was very good at that kind of introspection,

and he called the brain dependent, eye independent imagery,

he called it camembert for its continuity and lack of granularity.

And he called the seeing that involves the retina caviar,

because it's broken up into nervous units.

Didn't he change his views on consciousness though?

Later in his life he turned really rigid in regards to what he thought consciousness was?

In regards to what?

Salvador Dali I think started his career by basically saying that consciousness is very fluid,

very continuous, and then towards the end of his life he thought it was very discrete.

Probably, yeah. He fell into the fascist DNA mentality as he got rich by doing it.

Okay. Do you think serotonin and melatonin are necessary for dreaming?

I don't know.

Okay. Because some of the dreaming effects of LSD,

mainstream science claims that they're due because of the stimulation of one of the serotonin receptors,

but there are other chemicals, for example,

cyproheptadine is used, since it's a pure serotonin blocker,

it's used to calm down the nightmares of people with post-traumatic stress disorder,

but it doesn't eliminate their dreams.

Yeah. My first experiences with cyproheptadine were to improve my breathing at night,

and over the first two or three nights I was getting a good sleep because of the relieved bronchitis,

but after about five nights I started having weirdly intense dreams.

I think it was the changing balance of serotonin and histamine,

and so I stopped taking it for a while,

and when I returned to taking it I found that I had become about ten times more sensitive to it.

It did something building up so that I didn't need it after about five days,

but in the process it let loose something in the dream apparatus that made them disturbingly random and intense.

Do you think the nightmare seen in people with severe trauma is basically maybe some kind of a defense mechanism of the body,

because since these people have very highly elevated serotonin,

the body synthesizes more melatonin to lower the levels of serotonin,

and the excess melatonin causes these nightmares,

because melatonin is known in high doses to cause really disturbing and bizarre dreams.

Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

Okay.

Is that all you had, Georgie?

Sorry, I'm having PTSD from our connection keeps dipping a little bit, but I'm following along.

I was going to ask Ray about the symbols of an alien sky.

So, Ray, I know you're not an expert on it, and David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill,

I'm assuming those are some of the people that originated this idea,

but I did want to ask you, in a Vernadskyian sense,

if what they're talking about in Saturn and Venus and Mars created some kind of amazing electrical confirmation thousands of years ago,

and it blocked out our sun, how would that have changed evolution in us?

Like, if we didn't have the heat source of the sun radiating down on the planet?

And the changing magnetic fields, I think our brain development is very susceptible to the weak magnetic fields of the Earth,

and those are changed by events on the sun.

Velikovsky and several other people have theorized that it was these solar system events that created the great religious myths,

stories of the flood and so on, being actual historical memory of interactions, a spark passing between Venus and Earth, for example.

I mean, they call it the great period. Do you think... I could be not understanding, but in the Vernadskyian sense,

the sun is essential to the evolution and the complexifying nature of throwing energy into a system.

Would Saturn or the Venus, would that have taken the role of our sun?

And besides the magnetic fields, the heat being thrown at the Earth, would that have been...

that could have led to some superior evolution of humans and interactions and things, or what?

Have you ever read the guy that intended to debunk astrology and ended up confirming that he could see effects of the five heavy planets,

or the five nearby planets, not Mercury, but the biggest and closest planets, showed an influence on personalities according to their birth time?

Michel Gauquelin was the French guy who wanted to debunk it.

Cosmic clocks.

Cosmic, yeah.

Okay, so those planets being in very close proximity would have changed everything. Is that right to say?

Yeah, our time, the actual passage of time and intensity of chemical reactions, everything influenced by gravitational fields,

the concentration of neutrinos, that was Horace Dudley's idea that could explain the Michelson-Morley Ether drag,

that if neutrinos have a taste for associating with mass, then they tend to form a gradient,

getting more concentrated towards the center of the Earth and dropping off at high altitudes.

And so when Miller took his apparatus up either to higher mountains or put it into holes in the ground, deep basements,

he found less drag at high altitudes and more drag in the basements, consistent with Dudley's idea that the neutrino sea constitutes the luminiferous ether that used to be in the textbooks.

I mean, if their hypothesis is right, this seems like the most important thing imaginable.

I mean, is that overstating things? Like, what could be—like, it explains so much about human history.

It just seems like it's so central to understanding everything.

Yeah, I exchanged a few letters with Horace Dudley and asked his opinion on what he thought about crystal domains

and being a resonance, keys resonance factors for neutrinos and that the crystal in nature of the Earth would be the crystals that they were attracted to as well as the mass.

And he agreed that that seemed reasonable, but he hadn't mentioned it himself.

But I ran across a clipping by a physicist who had put radioactive carbon isotopes in fatty acid, incorporated into fatty acids.

And showed that in the test tube, they produced the perfect normal random nuclear decay,

which is the principle that everything—nuclear power reactors are based on the absolute randomness of decay.

But when he put a drop of this, let it form a monolayer on aluminum foil, he then recorded nonrandom decay,

showing that something as—a force as weak as the crystalline-like surface of a metal would allow some energy to store up and then hit the atoms in a nonrandom intermittent fashion.

And I corresponded with Dudley. He said that crystalline interaction with neutrinos seemed reasonable, but he hadn't talked about it.

But he was warning that we don't know enough about the factors that cause nuclear decay, and in the ignorance of what actually is causing the nuclear decay, being interaction with neutrino C,

he warned that nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors might not obey their assumption of random nuclear disintegration.

And I went to look up Anderson's article, the physics guy who put the fatty acid oil on aluminum, and I found that Anderson had published his article in the very week—the same journal

in which Dudley was warning against the dangers of nonrandom fission in nuclear reactors, and neither of them was aware of the other, but both came up to a similar conclusion that nuclear disintegration is not a random event.

Have you seen the news over the last two or three years that they found that the intensity of the sun's magnetic field influences the apparent randomness of the radioactive decay?

No, I haven't heard that, but that's the same idea that weak forces in the environment are not trivial or are not absolutely irrelevant to nuclear decay just because of the high energy it takes for a physics person to cause fission.

I mean, American nature undoubtedly has many alternative routes to creating disintegration.

So they didn't warn about spontaneous going off of nukes and reactors, but they did raise an issue with the reliance of biology and archaeology on dating archaeological artifacts by using the carbon-14 dating, and they said that's not reliable.

Anderson, in particular, got involved in that, and that whole thing—the creationist people were also challenging carbon dating, and so that was a further problem for Anderson's reputation.

He was talking about things that the creationists were interested in, too.

Okay. Are you familiar with the natural nuclear reactor that exists in Gabon in Africa?

No.

Apparently, if you Google it, you'll find it, but the reason I'm bringing this up is that the archaeologists found that there's been a nuclear reactor that apparently, if we believe the carbon dating, has been sitting there and periodically creating mini nuclear explosions every couple of hundred years, and they think it's at least 100,000 years old, if not more.

And they were kind of worried. The article that I read is that, well, if this nuclear reactor is capable of spontaneously going off, what does that mean for our man-made nuclear reactors?

It was a pretty interesting article, but if you Google "Gabon nuclear reactor" on Google, the Wikipedia page will come up immediately.

That sort of thing must be suppressed. It will destroy all of the existing assumptions of physics.

Do you think that's one of the major reasons not to pursue nuclear power is that, despite the assurances we're getting, the evidence, the trail of evidence that we have, like the Three Mile Island, the Chernobyl, and all the others, Fukushima, shows that these things tend to end badly, no matter how controlled they are.

Yeah. If you're familiar with a variety of physics professors, you can get an idea of how rigidly dogmatic they are about their assumptions.

When there was evidence of cold fusion, for example, they practically foamed at the mouth in saying what an awful thing that was to propose cold fusion.

It just caused their brains to undergo spontaneous reactions.

They did ruin the careers of those three original scientists that proposed it in the 70s, if I'm not mistaken.

Dudley warned me not to talk about any of these things if I was not financially independent.

He said he retired from the Navy and had a pension he could live on so he could dare to talk about such things.

Wow. Do you think that there have been civilizations on Earth that have been more, let's call them knowledge advanced, I don't like the word technology and science,

but that have been more in tune with nature and been capable of feats such as building the pyramids in Egypt or the ones in Mexico and whatnot?

Because those don't seem to be possible even with modern technology.

Yeah, yeah. There is intelligence popping up everywhere.

My favorite old civilization was the one that made those giant round heads in Mexico.

They were so intelligently designed and sculpted that they weren't archaic looking anatomically like the Egyptian sculptures.

Were those the Aztecs or not?

No, they were Olmecs I think they associated them with.

Okay. The reason I'm asking is because there are examples all over the world of artifacts that don't seem to be possible.

There's one even in Florida. There's a guy who was an immigrant to the United States.

I think he came originally from Latvia and he single-handedly built this castle using limestone blocks.

I think each one of them were like 10 tons each. In the early 20th century, there was just no technology that would allow this person to build that.

Of course, there are many myths about this, but what do you think could be the explanation?

His own writings are very cryptic. He claimed that he discovered that there is a nature of magnetism that is unlike anything that the official science books are saying.

He was capable of levitating these stones and moving them around. Do you think there's any possible truth to that or do you think it's completely bogus?

No. I'm open to all kinds of alternative interpretations.

Do you think if humanity is allowed to develop spontaneously without any authoritarian influence, we will be able to resolve most of our pressing problems pretty quickly?

Yeah. As soon as an interesting idea pops up in a university or corporation, it's likely to be destroyed before the person can talk to a reasonable number of informed people.

If you stop shooting down all of the interesting alternative ideas, things would necessarily multiply realistic possibilities exponentially.

You were born in the 30s. Do you remember even during childhood a time when, let's say in the United States or at least the Western world, it was a more freer time, I guess? More freer period?

Oh yeah. Old people at the time were always talking about how awful things are getting, but just from the late 30s to the late 40s, I saw a horrible increase in authoritarianism.

1950 was when it really took off with full government support to cleanse the high schools and universities of descending thinking in physics, biology, politics.

Do you think there may be a natural factor that may have contributed to that, such as changes in solar activity or maybe even intergalactic changes that would contribute to this increase in evil over the last hundred years?

No, I think it's the accumulation of power in the ruling class. I think we can see all of the links like Hitler accumulated power from American, British, and French banking institutions,

and the defeat of Germany was really the universalization of the structure of evil he had constructed.

His intelligence apparatus was taken over by the CIA, so Hitler himself lost, but the project continued.

The same bankers that created Hitler collaborated with the CIA to continue the project. That's why there was such a burst of evil with the year that the CIA was born.

That was when Lamarckism was rooted out of all of the schools in the United States.

Do you see power as a concept, as something akin to glycolysis and intelligence as something akin to oxidative phosphorylation?

Power is a very effective but very brutal way to do things, but at the cost of basically completely destroying intelligence.

Yeah, energetically it's like cancer. It runs very fast, but very stupidly.

So it's basically in a very inhospitable environment. It's indispensable to survival, but that's about it. It doesn't really have any other evolutionary usage.

Have you seen the article about Klaus Schwab and starting with his being born in 1938 in Germany and having assimilated in his formative first seven years the ethos of Nazism?

All of his talking points are a continuation of Hitlerism.

Same way that Conrad Lorenz with his genetic determinism was amplified with the defeat of Germany rather than suppressed.

So all of the eugenics people came into a world that was designed around all of the principles of gene determinism or eugenics.

I was watching one of James Corbett's video and he said the World Economic Forum was kind of making a power move among the elite people, maybe to establish dominance, even more than the Bilderbergers and the trilateral commissions and the CFR type of people.

They're apparently extremely organized. Do you think there's any truth to that?

I think the World Economic Forum has taken over right along with the CIA and the top biggest banks.

The Gates Foundation is one of their tools, but I think the brain of the system is between the World Economic Forum and the CIA.

I just don't remember hearing about Klaus for the last, maybe I'm just totally ignorant, which is a real possibility, but I just don't remember hearing about him very much through all the so-called conspiracy channels.

No, he was very open for the last five or six years. He's been saying all of these horrible things. We need more genetically modified organisms to completely take over the food economy. Everything has to be made artificial.

And then where does Eric Schmidt sit in that? Is he just an idea person that the World Economic Forum has taken a hold of his specific thoughts?

Yeah, I think he's on the level of the Gates Foundation. He's a tool of the American digital community.

And then, we've said it multiple times, but this whole thing is so the elite will never be challenged again. They'll dog tag everyone and then their power will be set for, I'm sure they think, forever.

Is there anybody who is warning the elite, sorry to interrupt, that there must be other people that have made the parallel, if not with glycolytic cancer, at least to the fact that after power concentration passes a certain threshold, empires tend to collapse.

Empires must be aware of that, or at least historically they must have seen what's happening after you become really, really too powerful. There's no one left to fight. And that's what seems to trigger sometimes the collapse of the empires.

Is there anybody warning the empire, the current empire, saying, "Look, we do need a little bit of intelligence. We shouldn't be crushing every last living free spirit around the world because that will be the end of us as well"?

No, I don't think they see that.

It's funny Gates is saying we need to vaccinate 7 billion people, but is it there like 7.8 or 7.5 billion people?

He's not including himself in that number, that's why.

So, while we're on this topic, is there any more to say about what's happened in a month's fray, like the developments, all the secret contracts and the Operation Warp Speed being apparently largely a military operation? Is there anything else of note that we should touch on?

No.

The lawyers who are getting organized to sue governments and demand release of the information that they based their shutdown on, if the courts have any autonomous function, that's going to be continuing to get more interesting.

It's funny because you sent me that video that was, what's it called? Let me scroll up here. It's Crimes Against Humanity by Reiner Fulmich.

And that video, I mean, it wouldn't have a million views or something, but I put it in the Notion document that I was going to use to collect all the notes for this episode, and right now I'm staring at a dead video. It was taken off YouTube.

And so that's very encouraging, the censorship that we're now dealing with.

What specifically about that, you might have just addressed it, but what specifically about that, do you think there's some kind of inroad to change through the law system?

Yeah, it's a win in court. It's going to get some attention, like was it Minnesota where they got a court decision against the governor and had her policy annulled?

Michigan, Michigan. The governor was Michigan.

There's a funny meme going around. It's like the founding fathers of the constitution. And it says, "Just in case anybody," I'm going to screw this up, but it's like, "Just in case anybody needs to know all of this doesn't matter in case there's a virus."

So it's like all these constitutional rights just vanish instantaneously when the WHO declares a pandemic apparently. And so very, very interesting.

I wanted to raise a point about the vaccines and the military being involved. I don't know if you're aware, but there's a federal law which basically mandates that the National Health Service, which is actually technically part of the military, is always involved in any vaccine trial.

And sometimes their involvement is classified. Do you know anything about that, Ray?

Involved in every what?

In every vaccine trial.

Oh, that's true that they are a branch of the military establishment.

Their only difference is that they aren't a weapons user. They have to get someone from another branch of the government if they want to have weapons when they visit you.

Right. I mean, I was reading a few blogs and apparently a lot of this is classified, but the reason they're involved is, officially at least, that's the official reason, is that because of that vaccine injury program that the Health and Human Services runs, apparently that's also ...

So the military says, "Look, we need to be involved as well." And the National Health Service is apparently mostly involved with reviewing the claims and determining if there's any national security threat to any of that.

So that's the official reasoning. But there have been some declassified documents that suggest that the military is actually actively looking at every vaccine trial and trying to glean information if this could become another bioweapon.

So they're getting access to all the medical records, to everything that happens in that vaccine trial.

And sometimes, of course this is all in the area of speculation, even if a vaccine is known to be dangerous and ineffective, the military will push for it to be released because they will think it can become an effective weapon in the future if it's only slightly modified so they can turn it against a foreign country.

Yeah, they've been throughout history of the 20th century, they've been operating a biological weapons establishment, researching it, and it periodically becomes public.

I think the reason the news around 2015 started coming out of how sloppy they were, thousands of potentially dangerous leaks of engineered viruses that were designed to be specifically infective to humans,

and more toxic symptoms produced than the wild virus, this information, it had been leaking out slowly,

about five years ago they started letting out more publicity about how dangerous this program was and that led to the moratorium which led to Fauci taking some of the programs outside the country, to China for example.

There are germ warfare labs operated by the US in several countries of Europe and Africa as well as China, so they're outside the US jurisdiction.

But I think the fact that we got so many leaks appearing suddenly was specifically part of the program, the Rockefeller Foundation, Gates Foundation, and World Economic Forum were working on this planned creation of a panic,

and as part of getting the public to panic it's very effective to let information leak out that these super dangerous engineered viruses might have been leaking all along for several years.

So they were basically sending a message to China that they might actually be ready to return to biological warfare against China with one of these super dangerous viruses.

Why would China allow, yeah go ahead.

Well China already in the Korean War had experience with American attempts at biological warfare.

Wilfred Birchert was the journalist who was following that and interviewing the people in China and Korea who had experienced the drops of the various organisms.

And so I think it was sending a message to China to help to create the environment for declaring the pandemic.

They knew they were going to declare a pandemic years in advance and it helped to give it realism by having these press releases.

So why would China even agree to have a US led laboratory or even work in tandem with the US to create these viruses considering that some of them very likely may be turned against China, may be used in a future attack against China?

I think they were hoping that they would have more knowledge of what the threat was if they were actually participating in it.

Okay so it's a form of like voluntary economic espionage. China said keep your enemies closer right? Get the US on our territory to do that work and we can learn what they're doing and potentially be ready to protect ourselves and also maybe develop even something better.

Yeah but I doubt that they realized that these plans had been going on for years to create the pandemic or to declare the pandemic.

But they took all of the necessary precautions in case it was a dangerous germ warfare agent but then within just two or three months they were right in Wuhan, they were celebrating holidays in gigantic public assemblies.

There's a picture on the internet of hundreds and hundreds of people crammed into a giant swimming pool right at the peak of the pandemic fear in the United States. These people were a thousand or so together standing two or three feet apart.

So a couple of things. So do you think basically China first of all realized that this virus is not what of course the propaganda is trying to make it out to be and they basically now they're fully open. Is that why you think China reopened? They realized it's a false flag?

Yeah I think they realized the threat was gone about May and they reopened everything.

So how do you think the US public, a significant portion of the US public and I don't know a significant portion of Europe, Western world in general, how can they look at China being fully reopened and several other countries as well and still believe that we need to go into a lockdown and there's a surge here and all these masks and all these other measures are necessary considering the Chinese are having the times of their lives right now?

I think they're just so confident that they've done a thorough brainwashing job controlling the media now for 70 some years total control.

I haven't seen a single article in the popular press that said, "Hey look China is fully open. How come they're open and we're not?" This has never been brought up to my knowledge in any of the major newspapers in the United States or Western Europe.

Yeah they can get away with saying that everything coming out of China is fake because they're a communist country even though they're nominally communist. They're the world's biggest capitalist economy.

Right. Okay.

Speaking of the vaccine, did you see the news about every, what is it, three out of four phase three trial vaccines had a serious adverse event. In two of them people died and the third one was transverse myelitis which is the media's euphemism for polio.

So I thought like, "Oh how convenient." Maybe the reason they don't want to call it a polio is because then people will start asking the question of, "Was the polio epidemic in the 50s caused maybe by one of these engineered or vaccines gone rogue?"

Yeah and have you seen the figures showing that the very year the vaccine came out and the polio incidence of cases suddenly dropped off, the other things such as myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome,

other types of very similar paralytic diseases skyrocketed back up to the level that had been seen in polio epidemics.

So the same thing as with the flu. The flu cases have disappeared today but the COVID ones are spiking.

Yeah. One thing disappears when they rename it something else.

Wow. What do you think is causing the polio? Do you think it's a viral disease or do you think it's just a toxicity symptom in a severely hypodermic person?

Starting early in the 20th century, people were noticing that polio epidemics appeared first in history in the countries in which the medical profession decided to become up to date and do things that verbalists couldn't,

weren't allowed to do by injecting all of their drugs. The hypodermic needle had been invented just 10 or 20 years before the first polio epidemic and doctors started injecting all sorts of drugs and people started noticing that the paralytic polio cases,

practically all of them had previously been injected with something, if not a vaccine, other drugs.

And all through the early part of the 20th century, it was actively discussed that the fact showed that the arm or the leg which was paralyzed happened to be the arm or leg in which some injection had taken place.

Usually a vaccine but any injection tended to be associated with paralysis in that particular limb.

By 1950, that was being seriously investigated and in Africa, it is now pretty well recognized that the paralyzed limb is the one in which the child had the polio vaccine injection.

Have you seen the case studies on PubMed?

Animal experiments showed that injecting an irritant into the muscle sends signals to the brain indicating inflammation and damage and they could create a paralytic localization according to where they injected something.

So animal experiments confirmed the observations in humans.

Have you seen the published case studies on PubMed showing that compromised gut barrier can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome and many of these paralytic states that we've seen also with vaccines?

So basically what I'm getting at is that endotoxin overload can trigger temporarily such paralysis in limbs and sometimes even mimic the symptoms of stroke.

And if I'm not mistaken, for a long time, endotoxin, also known as lipopolysaccharide, was used as an adjuvant in the vaccines. Do you know if it's still used?

Only accidentally. It's in a lot of the vaccines silently. They don't list it as an ingredient naturally, but it's there because of the general contamination of the culture medium.

Do you think the aluminum that has replaced the lipopolysaccharide as an adjuvant, do you think it can trigger some of the same symptoms, the paralytic symptoms?

Yeah, it's very powerful. Some of the aluminum shows up in the brain. An English professor has done a lot of research on that and produced very consistent convincing results that the aluminum is reaching the brain and causing a variety of symptoms.

So basically don't get the vaccine, right? Because it's definitely going to have at least aluminum in it.

Yeah, and I think a lot of them do have the endotoxin.

Speaking of vaccines and the polarization in our society, maybe a good segue, the physiology of being offended. And as I was exploring that question, I think, Ray, you initially referenced it in one of your articles, the Paul Andrews paper, "Is serotonin an upper or downer?"

He says, "In summary, the melancholic brain appears to be reconfiguring to learn solutions to complex problems. The processes involved in this learning appear to be so energetically expensive that growth and reproduction are downregulated. We argue that the process involved in making these tradeoffs are coordinated by serotonin."

Vaccines, our conversations about Stalin, a lot of things that seriously rile people up. Is there a certain physiology with this intense anger of what is happening when somebody is violently reacting to an idea that they don't like?

It does activate, especially serotonin, probably histamine too. And that undoubtedly is increasing their intestinal permeability, vascular permeability all through the system.

I sort of hoped that some of my comments about Lysenko maybe were causing strokes of some of the fanatics.

You were hoping?

Is it because the culture gives so few resources to find meaning and so people integrate these ideas within themselves and then if they encounter something that doesn't fit, it causes some kind of intense physiological reaction?

Oh yeah. It's like slandering their mother. Same sort of reaction, blind fury.

You said it on one of our older podcasts, but if you don't feel good, you're aging or you're degenerating. I thought that was, even though that might be kind of obvious, but I thought that was important to emphasize. If you're not in the euphoric state, there's something wrong.

Yeah.

Have you seen the studies that are mostly done on animals that mitochondrial dysfunction, in other words, low metabolism, basically ensures that the animal will assume a subordinate status while at the same time becoming extremely aggressive to anything that it dislikes in its environment?

Basically, it's the symptom of low energy that maybe because the animal feels that any change, any novelty, it cannot really cope with, it cannot really incorporate into its worldview, and that's why it's becoming aggressive, but it comes down to essentially mitochondrial dysfunction.

And the typical authoritarian personality, subservient to power but vicious towards underlings.

Yeah. That's exactly what those studies found, that it was the most vicious animal. So, there was an alpha rat that they created artificially. That's the other thing.

Those studies were interesting because they showed that this whole thing about the alpha male is actually almost entirely artificial concept. It only occurs when you place animals in a situation where they have to fight for food for survival.

As long as you provide them with ample food, then the structure becomes much more egalitarian, even in species where they claim there's always an alpha person.

Yeah. Had we talked about James Prescott's old article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on pleasure and the origins of violence?

I haven't heard it, but maybe you've talked about it with Daniel.

Yeah, I'm familiar with it, Rick.

He looked at, I think it was 80-some anthropological studies. He was working in one of the NIH branches as a psychologist,

and he saw that it was an invariable pattern that an authoritarian culture in which males were very high in the hierarchy,

women and children were mistreated and low in the hierarchy, and there was always some kind of bodily mutilation.

It could be scarring or distortion of the ears or lips or circumcision, but these features, hierarchy, cruelty, and mutilation went with a warlike policy.

Long before Prescott published this article, which got him fired, an Oxford professor had looked at the earlier literature and came up with exactly the same conclusions,

but he said sexual repression was necessary to create culture. He said all of these things, the energetic society that created an empire by making war against weaker powers,

this required sexual repression, and so he had exactly the same conclusion, but he, being an English professor in Oxford,

concluded that that was the good stuff, empire and dominance and hierarchy.

Trevor Burrus: I think he advocated for Japanese-style bathrooms and kind of a more liberal view towards nakedness and things,

and I thought that was interesting. When that was distorted, like you just said, there were all sorts of weird things that would develop.

Richard D. Barker: Yeah. The guy that did the play at Harvard and got fired for it called anti-Semitic because he argued that circumcision was a power institution

to make sex unsatisfying for the men and to make them authoritarian personalities.

Trevor Burrus: And also to induce this feeling of subordination from a very early age, right?

Richard D. Barker: Yeah. You were subject to mutilation.

Trevor Burrus: Yeah. Some of your most precious organs, which I guess in an impressionable little child would be even more traumatic.

Richard D. Barker: Yeah.

Trevor Burrus: Do you think that the opposite could also be used to militarize the culture? In other words, the encouragement of extreme sexual promiscuity?

Richard D. Barker: Yeah. I think so. Wilhelm Reich made that argument that denaturing sex was behind the commercialization of sex.

Taking the love out of it made it mechanical and basically biologically unsatisfying.

Trevor Burrus: So it's akin to the mutilation of the circumcision, but mentally?

Richard D. Barker: Yeah.

Trevor Burrus: Okay. Do you see some of that in our culture these days? Because I certainly do.

Richard D. Barker: Yeah. The FDA burned all of Reich's books, including the Mass Psychology of Fascism, which he said was based on sexual control.

They were burned as medical devices.

Trevor Burrus: Ray, I did want to – it's kind of in the same vein, but to somebody, you said the use of non-communicative jargon can be an indication of a personality disorder.

I thought that I – one, I think I know who you're talking about, and then two, that is so common in the health world and the authoritarian world.

What is – is that a form of protection from the self or something?

Like what's –

Richard D. Barker: Yeah, they would be embarrassed to admit their total ignorance of a particular thing, and so they babble out some words that are completely idiotic, but they assume that no one is going to understand what stupid thing they just said because it was based on Latin words.

Trevor Burrus: Well, like the Dunning-Kruger effect, one, do you buy into that concept? And then there's certainly – if that's a valid concept, there's certainly some kind of physiology associated with it, correct?

Richard D. Barker: Yeah. Authoritarianism is why doctors don't have to think about what they're doing.

Trevor Burrus: And high serotonin being associated with that.

Richard D. Barker: Yeah, and the – they are – the real doctors who think about what they're doing are dropping out of the profession because they're – the extent to which it's being taken over by the powers wanting to make everything an algorithm.

So like Cuomo in New York wants to digitize medicine, do away with personal contact with your doctor.

Trevor Burrus: What – like even the sick, high serotonin person, when they do defect from kind of the status quo, what exactly is happening physiologically? Like is there some kind of break or – like you've called it something like the navigating, the orienting reflex or something.

Is that for a moment activated based on like discordant information or something? Like what do you think is happening there?

Richard D. Barker: Yeah, when the orienting reflex kicks in, you're redesigning your whole organism to some extent. And so it can be a turning point in your life.

Trevor Burrus: But that's – I'm hesitant to say it's random. Like what – how does – what initiates that, especially for a person that has so much to lose?

Richard D. Barker: I really don't know.

Trevor Burrus: Just some kind of life experience or a story that no longer makes any sense, right?

Richard D. Barker: Yeah, yeah.

I have a question. Do you know approximately when the replacement of incandescent light bulbs in hospitals happen? And what – do you think that that may have coincided a little bit with the increase of authoritarianism and psychopathy among the medical profession, just being exposed to blue lights like 24/7?

Richard D. Barker: People started talking about it already in the 50s. John Ott, you know, who created the Ott light, the full spectrum light, emphasized that all of the wavelengths falling not only on your skin but getting into your eye, that the full spectrum light can restore lots of degenerative problems.

Arthritis was his first experience with it. And all of that was going on already in the 1950s when fluorescent lights became popular.

Trevor Burrus: But that thought seems to have been long lost. I mean I haven't seen anything bringing up – well, actually there was an article about maybe three years ago that said fluorescent lights may give you a headache, but that's about it. I mean all of these ideas of them being much more dangerous seem to be forgotten.

Richard D. Barker: Yeah. Some of Ott's experiments showed that weak x-rays were being produced at the ends of the tubes and that that was part of the toxic effect.

The lead foil around the ends of the tubes he found made them less toxic.

I think also the plastic, which has become utterly pervasive in our lives, but especially in hospitals.

There was a study two years ago that showed that simply peeling off scotch tape produced by the company 3M, but they said it could be anyone, produced actually full blown x-rays.

And they were able to take a picture of the finger of one of the researchers against a photosensitive film by just peeling off scotch tape against that finger of the person.

And they opined that basically if you essentially create a sufficient charge in any plastic object and then create a discharge, then you can basically create x-rays on demand.

They're relatively weak, but still very dangerous.

And I keep thinking that when me and my wife were going to the hospital just to get examined for the baby with the ultrasound,

the x-ray technicians kept getting these static shocks off of the equipment all the time.

And at the time I didn't know that they were maybe potentially creating x-rays, but it seems to be a pretty common thing in the hospital.

Plastics are everywhere and static electricity gets discharged all the time.

So do you think that may play a role as well?

Oh, sure. People have devised various ways to stop that effect in plastic, but I don't know how well applied they are.

Do you think the plastic may also, I mean, so I guess the endocrine disrupting effect also plays a role in the pathologizing of the hospital environment?

Yeah, a lot of the plastics are still emitting toxic chemicals too.

Is there any type of safe plastic in your opinion, or are they all capable of essentially discharging estrogenic thyroid inhibiting substances?

I don't know anything toxic about the polyethylene type plastic.

Okay.

I wanted to get into the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but I don't know if we'll have enough time to do that subject justice.

So maybe we could talk about Mexican Coke.

Right there.

So Ray, since living here for, yeah, Georgie has one on hand.

Since living here, I've noticed that children and adults are frequently carrying the liter bottles of Coke all the time, you know?

And I think it tastes completely different, like the Mexican Coke versus anywhere else I've had it.

But I think, I wanted to talk about this because eight years ago, I think we were talking to somebody on a podcast, and they asked you, like, "Oh, what did you eat yesterday?"

And you're like, "Oh, a steak and some coffee and some milk and a Coke."

And to my 2012 or 2011 brain, that like exploded it because that was such a non-traditional item in a so-called health person's nutrition.

And so I don't know if talking about it would yield some other insights and might open up other people to why something like Mexican Coke would be useful in our current situation of kind of horrendous environment.

And so do you feel like defending Mexican Coke, or what is your thought on that?

Yeah, I think sucrose has great virtues therapeutically.

I've heard stories about fatally apparently injured animals and people who are in the hospital with hopeless symptoms being given a mouthful.

In the case of an animal in shock, they would pour a mouthful of honey in its mouth and hold its mouth shut, and in a few minutes, the animal would be up and not dying at all.

And that has happened to dogs and sheep and ducks and all sorts of animals as well as patients who were in the hospital in a hopeless condition.

Someone slipped on a jar of honey and gave them a tablespoon of it, and their symptoms disappeared.

And dozens and dozens of stories like that convince me that in an emergency of almost any sort, a good big dose of sucrose is very important.

But if you compare just coffee with added sucrose, I don't think you get quite the effects you do with Mexican Coke.

I think the coca leaf extractives are really biologically active, doing something very different from the caffeine content.

Yeah, you know I have an article here, it says Coke dropped cocaine from its recipe around 1900, but the secret formula is...

They extract the cocaine from the coca leaf but sell the remaining stuff to Coca-Cola.

So just to reiterate, the coca leaf extract has medicinal anti-inflammatory or anti-stress properties, and then you said you've seen a mineral analysis, and so there's some nutrition as well to the Coke?

Yeah, when they compared Pepsi to Coke, Pepsi was high in sodium, so that in Indochina it was recommended for babies with diarrhea as a sterile source of sodium and sugar.

But Coke didn't have nearly that much sodium, but it was very high in potassium, and the plant extractives are the only logical source for potassium.

And then the chemical for methyllimidazole, that's like brown, similar to the brown in coffee? Is there any harm to that substance?

Probably there's some harm in it, but it's offset by the other values.

Do you think there may be some psychoactive substances in coca leaf outside of the cocaine, because it's rarely only one alkaloid or whatever chemical is there that's just producing all of the effects?

They know there are several congeners of cocaine that are biologically active, but they just don't want to talk about it because they might be ordered to take those out too, and then no one would buy the product.

What do you think are the main dangers of cocaine? Is it similar to LSD, like in higher dosages become serotonergic?

Yeah, it is such a powerful stimulant. It can make things run at such a high intensity that it destroys the system.

But its main stimulant effect, do you think it's happening through the dopamine system or by stimulating metabolism?

It somewhat stimulates metabolism, but it activates the expenditure of energy so fast that's where you can get ahead of the metabolic support system and get sick from taking too much too often.

Is that why cocaine was used as a weight loss drug by housewives back in the early 1900s?

Probably. It does run the system at a high speed and it's likely to give you vitamin deficiencies and mineral deficiencies for that reason.

So similar to dinitrophenol basically?

Yeah.

Just because we'll probably get comments on it, fresh fruit juice or guava or orange or whatever would be preferable to coke.

What is your point of view of the puritanical nutritionism of some groups online, like these people that are so obsessed with nutrients. Obviously it's important, but with them not implementing things like carbon dioxide, they're not really getting the full picture. What do you think about that?

Yeah, the full picture is the whole thing. If you have all of the nutrients but an imbalance between fats and sugars for example, you're working on destroying your mitochondria.

And then the individual sleeping next to the router full of the polyunsaturated fats, they might be tempted to say like, "The Mexican coke is harmful," when in their specific situation it might be the most therapeutic thing they could immediately gravitate to.

Yeah. The fat people are quick to jump in and say, "Eat polyunsaturated fats and cut down your sugar intake," but that's the worst advice ever given.

It's causing chromosomal injury in millions of kids to have parents that have grown up on a high PUFA, anti-thyroid situation.

I have a question about Pepsi, because since you mentioned it, and it happens to be on the World Health Organization's list of approved oral rehydration therapies.

And I think that's why you mentioned that in babies in Asia it's approved, or in Africa it's approved as a treatment for diarrhea, because since they're losing a lot of electrolytes. Is that right?

Right.

Is there any benefit to Pepsi similar to the coca leaf, or is that unique to the coke product?

From the very low potassium content in the analysis I've seen, I would guess it doesn't really have a real significant amount of leaf extractives.

Okay. So basically it's just essentially sugar with water and caffeine.

Yeah. Sort of what it tastes like, too.

I think Mexican coke tastes like a fine wine. I think it tastes so good.

Anyways, Ray, I did want to ask you about this quote, and again, this was part of my intro to you.

You said a long time ago in 2011, "When people supplement thyroid and eat liver once or twice a week, their acne and dandruff and many other problems usually clear up very quickly."

I want to emphasize that just because of the simplicity of implementation.

I don't know if you want to talk about that at all, but I thought increasing the metabolic rate while improving the nutrition was kind of like an elegant approach to trying to solve maybe a complex health situation.

But doing both of those things, people seem to be resistant to either improving the nutrition or taking thyroid or thinking thyroid is very dangerous or not liking the taste of liver and trying to avoid it.

Yeah. You can make up for the absence of liver, but it takes a lot of attention to do it because it's such a rich source of many of the luxury nutrients.

Vitamin A is hard to get enough of in the active animal source of retinol.

They're pushing carotene, which is a powerfully anti-thyroid, anti-progesterone agent.

So if you try to meet your vitamin A requirements with carrot juice, for example, you're very likely to get all kinds of metabolic problems, including hormonal deficiencies.

And then last question for me.

And lung cancer, which they found out recently beta-carotene from carrot juice or from supplements seems to be drastically increasing the risk of lung cancer.

Yeah. Many, many other bad things too.

Last question for me, then I'll give it to Georgie, then I'll read the Super Chats and then let you go, Ray.

A few times you said that the Cynoplus tablet is two and a half grains, but I thought it was always three grains. Am I missing something?

It depends on what your definition of a grain is. The FDA decreed that a glandular thyroid has a certain composition, but they apparently haven't bothered measuring the differences.

Whether it's pork or beef and where the animal grew up affects very strongly the composition of the hormone value of the glandular thyroid.

So just by decree, again, about 50 years ago, they said that 100 micrograms of T4 is equivalent to 25 micrograms of T3.

And also by decree, they said that glandular thyroid usually has 3.1 parts of T4 when it's digested to each part of T3.

But all of those things are variable according to the particular mineral. So the most important thing to realize is that that ratio of 100 micrograms to 1 microgram of T4 to T3, to 25 micrograms of T3, that that ratio is imaginary.

An ideal male medical student maybe would get results like that, but in the average 35-year-old female, there's no such equivalence at all.

100 micrograms of T4 very often has antithyroid effects in a middle-aged female. And so T3 has much more value than four times the value of T4.

But like a third of a Cynoplus tablet, and I think that weighs out to like 53 milligrams, that would be, you're not objecting to calling that like a grain, right?

You're just saying it's very complex, the history of what a grain is and what a grain isn't.

Yeah.

Well, I thought a grain was just a measurement of weight. And then when the FDA got involved in defining how thyroid should look like, the natural desiccated thyroid, they try to kind of like force the various multitude of variations of natural thyroid into the definition of 65 milligrams.

Yeah, at the beginning of the 20th century, they were still using raw thyroid or cooked, but wet thyroid tissue.

And so they talked about the therapeutic dose as being one or two or three or four grains, the grain being a weight measure, 62 and a half, I think it is, milligrams.

And when the Armour Company and a couple of other smaller companies began dehydrating the product, taking out the 65 or 70% water meant that the deep padded plant was three or four times as effective as the wet plant, simply because of the absence of water.

And so they added lactose to make up for the water weight so that their product, doctors who were familiar with the wet plant prescription in terms of grains of wet, fresh plant,

they could go directly to a certain weight grain of the dehydrated product because the added lactose brought up the weight.

So the potency per weight was identical to the fresh plant.

But during its development, Armour was constantly mixing their different batches, recognizing that one particular batch of dehydrated, deep padded plant would have very different potencies.

So they would mix them until they could get a product that had the expected potency of fresh land on mice.

All of the batches were standardized for decades, testing them on mice.

So there was no rigid formula.

It was a matter of mixing until they got the right effect.

That all went away in the 90s when Armour went out of the thyroid business.

And the FDA took over by proclaiming the content.

And so people came to think that the glandular thyroid actually contained T4 and T3.

It doesn't contain those until it's broken down and digested.

Your digestive system is where the T3 and T4 are formed.

So it's misleading to describe the hormonal content at all of an untested glandular preparation.

So just talking about T3 and T4 in micrograms is a lot simpler than the erroneous measurement of grains.

Yeah.

And the CINOPLUS is very consistent in how many micrograms of each they put on each tablet.

Understood.

Georgie, do you have any last questions?

Then I'll read these super chats and then let Ray go.

Yeah, two questions.

One of them related to vaccines.

I keep getting emails maybe like once a week.

And they're usually from people that are unhappy about our stance on vaccines.

They keep saying, "Okay, we get the point.

Vaccines are dangerous.

They get all these things that can damage your health.

And they're likely not even effective because a well-functioning metabolism in a healthy cell should be capable of defending itself against the virus, infecting it and starting to replicate."

And then they say, "Well, what about really deadly viruses that basically are guaranteed to kill people unless these people get vaccinated?"

And they keep bringing up the rabies vaccine or the rabies virus.

What would you say to that, Ray?

Why does it seem that a rabies virus would kill anybody, including a healthy person with 100% lethality, unless they get vaccinated?

How do they know that?

I don't know.

I guess what they don't take into account is how many healthy people got bitten and infected with rabies virus but survived, right?

Yeah, but lots of people have been bitten by a rabid dog and weren't where they could get treatment or maybe took an herb and were fine.

I've known several people who were bitten by an officially tested rabid dog and took a cactus potion or some herb and didn't get rabies.

So, they were convinced that the herb was curative.

I think it was just their natural tendency not to contract rabies.

Is there any feature of viruses, or viri, or whatever the plural is, that would make them more or less lethal depending on which system they tend to attack?

I suppose there would be a difference between chickenpox and smallpox, the nature of the sore it produces.

And herpes, for example, they just have the type of cell they favor to live in or reproduce in.

Some people are innately immune to those even though they don't have antibodies against them. Their whole system just isn't compatible with the properties of the virus.

So, I guess all other things being equal, things like maybe if the herpes virus tends to attack the nervous system, there's more potential for a more serious outcome.

All other things being equal.

Yeah, but the better a person's health is, the less they notice having contracted herpes.

Okay. So, in your view, there's nothing really special about the rabies virus, which is just another fear-mongering that says, "Get yourself vaccinated right now."

Yeah, there haven't been any studies really that are relevant to human susceptibility.

And my second question is related to pregnenolone. There seems to be a lot of talk about that in terms of what's – many companies claim they have 99.9% pure pregnenolone,

but some people report that they get bad side effects of it, and the emails that I got from them seem to indicate that you don't think it's ever the actual pregnenolone that's causing this.

It's some kind of a contamination that's in the pregnenolone.

Do you have any specific things in mind in terms of contaminants that may cause such reactions, considering that the pregnenolone is at least – has been shown to be of such high purity?

Yeah, that one part per thousand or less, if it's something very active like an estrogenic fragment of a steroid, it takes only a few micrograms of an estrogenic substance to cause symptoms like sore breasts or uterine spasms or cramps.

I started having bad reactions to everything except the old Syntex product, the ones who were the first steroid producers,

and developed the very rigid German chemists in charge, made sure everything was done punctiliously, and other products that came on the market,

some of them even smelled different, but all of them had a very high chemical purity test, but I started having bad reactions, intestinal inflammation reactions to it, so I pretty much stopped using it about 20 years ago.

Do you think it's possible that even a pure pregnenolone, just by sitting in a bag, it may tend to disintegrate over time into some estrogenic substances?

Because there are studies showing that bacteria in air can actually metabolize pregnenolone into various estrogens. Yeast can do that too?

Very possible.

Okay. So what would be a good storage? Just put it in the freezer and keep it at as low temperature as possible?

Yeah. If you have it from a source and have tested it on oneself and friends, and can take a teaspoonful of it with no adverse effects at all for two or three days, then you're pretty sure it's the real stuff.

So maybe a good test for additional test for pregnenolone, in addition to the certificate of analysis, which only tests purity, heavy metals, and presence of bacteria, maybe also test for some of the well-known estrogenic metabolites?

I think so.

Okay. That's actually a good idea. I mean, there aren't that many, at least, that are known, so a lab should be able to test even if they're in microgram quantities.

Mm-hmm.

Okie doke.

I don't have anything else.

Let me just read these really quickly. Unfortunately, we won't be able to get to questions because Ray will be here all day, but Fab for 10 euros. Appreciate it, Fab. Thank you. Nick T for another 10 euros, I think. Thank you, Nick. Kathleen, 24.99. Thank you so much, Kathleen.

She says thank you. Machel for $50. Thank you so much, Machel. He says thank you for an inspiring discussion. Thank you, Machel. Linda Bell for $5. Harry Burgos for $25. Guys, thank you so much. I will forward these right to Ray. And I think that is it.

So, Ray, Georgie, thank you guys so much. Sincerely appreciate it. Ray, any parting words?

Nope.

And Georgie, any parting words?

Just stay safe and try to stay safe.

Yeah, I guess we'll catch up next month after the total insanity that awaits us on November 3rd, so that should be fun. Ray, stay safe. Everybody in the chat and watching this at a future date, stay safe. Thank you guys so much. We have an amazing audience.

Please subscribe on BitChute, Odyssey, which is library, or my Telegram because I just feel like our days on YouTube are probably numbered in some way, shape, or form, and so it's probably imperative that people follow us on other platforms.

And that is it. Thank you guys so much. Thank you, Ray. Thank you, Georgie. Have a great weekend, everybody. We'll talk to you guys soon. Bye, everybody.

Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope. It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.

Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?

I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished by the time we get there.

Victor Technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this year, may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

Piloting the space shuttle is very difficult, the difficult one would think. Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits. In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

To give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons infinite and obsolete.

Tonight, consistent with our obligations of the ADF Treaty, recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies, I'm taking an important first step.

Instant US retaliation. Nuclear war. Nuclear war.

What if free people...In Japan, where high technology is showcased, consumers stare and wonder at the latest fast-food

life overtaken by the computer age, the department store.

While the Seaboo store is proud of its technology, it is worried that customers will feel it has lost the human touch.

This guy, Tom, what's his last name? He's one that is considered to have invented the abiotic oil theory, at least for Western chemistry.

He's the one that invented the abiotic oil theory, at least for Western chemistry.

He's the one that invented the abiotic oil theory, at least for Western chemistry.

And the intrinsic heat of the giant planets, that is still being confirmed.

The giant gas planets are emitting heat in proportion to their mass.

And that's consistent with the whole planetary creation of everything that happens on the planet.

Not just driven by solar energy, but the internal chemistry of the planet.

So do you think in that case, things like peak oil are just another political psyop that's basically created to feed the narrative of climate change and the great reset and so on?

Yeah. The deep ocean vents that are emitting organisms basically.

A whole ecology up to worms.

In the super hot ocean water, the high pressure lets them tolerate the heat.

And the volcanic emissions into the ocean water are providing the life-supporting system.

I think that's a model of how life originated.

Hot rocks and gas interacting with water, producing very quick, highly developed ecologies.

And the whole story of gradual evolution, I think, is really just looking at how the phases of the Earth's development turn out rather than random gene accumulation.

So basically, if I can make a jump here, a thought jump, evolution is an energetically driven process.

It doesn't necessarily proceed in a straight line or even progress all the time.

It really depends on the energetic supplies of the environment.

Yeah. But the novel thing is to see it driven from the inside of the planet rather than just from the sun.

Okay. Do you think there were times during Earth's history when there were organisms or maybe even if you read mythology and believe the mythology,

there were human races or humanoid-like beings that were more advanced than us?

Do you think that makes sense based on…

Yeah. There have been fossil observations of what seemed to be petrified human-like things in rocks that was believed to be millions of years old.

And all of those extreme anomalies get people, include them in literature and such, but they don't make it into the science journals.

Are you familiar with the Hinduist mythology?

They have these periods of development in the universe and apparently right now we're living in the period that's like the least beneficial for organisms.

They call it Kali Yuga, under the goddess of the evil.

And their mythology says that in the past there were periods when the environment was much more…

I mean, they speak about gods, but really it's all allegory.

And in the past there were periods when the environment was much more conducive for civilization and consciousness.

And the human beings of these past eras were 10 feet tall, they were living 900 years,

which immediately led me to thinking of the Boskov skull and the stories of the Bible of Methuselah living 900 years and whatnot.

Do you think all of these things could be talking about the same phenomena, like civilizations being better in the past at some point?

Yeah, and even in the last 100 years or so, we see extreme differences in lifespans.

The official biology industry just says that it's all lies, but the churches have been keeping birth records on people for hundreds and hundreds of years.

And the records are there showing people, quite a few, well over 150 years old.

In terms of civilizational development, what do you think is a… I don't know if there's an optimal energy source, but…

Is there, or do you think there's an optimal energy source?

I mean, I would think you would be heavily against nuclear power, right?

Oh, sure. Volcanic power is the obvious thing.

Basically converting that to… like geothermal energy? Is that what you're…

Yeah. It's generously available and easy to get.

Life arising from the ocean, that was in the living state, St. Georgie, that was also his thesis,

that we couldn't leave the ocean until we figured out how to bring it with us, like the water in our bodies. Is that on the right track?

No, I don't think that's the membrane people are talking about.

They had to invent genes that could make a seal membrane that would let the cell hold water.

But primitive proteins spontaneously generated in a few minutes in the lab by Sidney Fox,

those proteins are water regulatory, create their own appearance of a membrane.

They have a very standard, regular size, and they can assimilate new proteins,

and when they do, they bud off just like a yeast, forming a little sphere that assimilates more protein

and grows up to the standard size at which point it buds.

So all of this is something that happens in a matter of hours in the experimental laboratory,

and the evolutionists are just trying to hang on to their picture of history and how a cell requires a membrane.

Okay, well, you mentioned how life can be the volcanoes and the creation of life in the water.

How does that translate to eventually forming us?

When a volcano happens to be near the edge of the ocean or just in a place that gets rained on,

then you get the same thing happening just with the drier surroundings.

But the proteins regulate the ocean to keep out excess water,

and they regulate the air environment to keep in the right amount of water.

It's hygrophilic enough that it's self-regulating for the water and mineral content.

So the ocean plays the role of the – what was that experiment that recently was done?

Somebody threw water on really hot rock and then amino acids started spontaneously emerging?

Yeah, that's Sidney Fox that created the spontaneous cell-like spheres.

Did you ever have any communication with him?

Nope.

So I have "The Biosphere" by Vladimir Vernadsky, a few quotes up, and he says,

"Creatures on Earth are the fruit of extended complex processes

and are an essential part of the harmonious cosmic mechanism."

When was he writing that? Was that in the 18 – how old was this?

1920s, '30s period, I think.

And then you have a quote about like an old interview where you say,

"Talking about purpose, you speak more like a religious person,

but this whole idea of energy being thrown into a system and complexifying,"

that's kind of what Vernadsky was talking about?

Mm-hmm. Things spontaneously organize and create higher and higher organized structures.

In terms of driving the course of evolution,

do you think it's the Earth's internal activity and energetic balance that's more –

that's a bigger factor, or solar activity and other planets, or is it all like together, the totality of it?

The present condition on Earth is being slightly modified and directed

by changes that interact between planets and the sun.

But the same basic tendency to basically create hotter, faster, bigger brains

that organize bigger, longer-lived organisms,

that's the general drift that Vernadsky talked about.

Are you familiar with the work of this young professor at MIT

who's basically verbatim said what you just did, and his theory now,

and he's presenting his own, is that basically life is simply an energy-dissipating mechanism,

and you can measure the complexity of life by measuring the intensity of the energy-dissipation process,

which is just another word for metabolism.

I think he's like 32 years old or something. Are you familiar with his work?

Yeah. And there's a Russian that – I think he died about 20 or 30 years ago –

that had carried on the idea to study the energy dissipation in an egg.

He described the process as an egg unscrambling itself by the intensity of the energy

that it produces.

So in other words, it's the energy dissipation that keeps the egg from randomizing itself,

and the same thing for all life.

It's a generator of higher and higher order.

So the egg is apparently mostly random stuff when you compare it to the organism that comes from it,

but it's the ability to produce energy with just enough of the residual information put into it

by the mother system that will shape how that energy develops.

But the whole process is really the ability to produce energy very fast,

starting with the egg and the early embryo, and that's modified by the conditions it runs into.

What was the name of the guy who challenged Hayflick, and he had the opposite idea of him?

He said that cells are immortal, and he did his experiments with chicken embryos.

Alexis Peral.

Peral, yeah.

Yeah. So do you think his – I mean, because if you read the official story,

they said, oh, he was a fraud, like he was basically a –

It always has to be a fraud.

Anything that is very clear and obvious, it had to be that these technicians over a period of 20 years

were all participating in a fraud to introduce new chickens.

So when do you think that drive started happening to prove that life on its own decays

and basically that's our destiny, there's nothing that can be done about it?

Because it seems like the early 20th century, people were –

most of the scientific consensus, which is a bad thing, but at the time it was –

everybody believed, based on the available evidence, that cells were immortal

unless harassed externally by a bad environment.

Mendel really started it as his attempt to disprove all of Charles Darwin's unorthodox Lamartism.

Mendel was going to prove that genes are immortal and that it's only the similar body that's mortal.

And that was taken up by August Weissman in the '90s.

He was the guy that amputated the tails of 1,200 mice and said their offspring still had tails,

so Lamart and Darwin were wrong.

And he advocated the wear and tear cause of aging because the genes are immortal

and they spin off the dregs that don't – he said they don't even have the genetic ability

to make any more – the process of differentiating, according to Weissman,

was a progressive loss of potential as it thins out the inheritance genes.

And so this somatic dregs is just constantly wearing out the way a machine wears out

because there's no mechanism for renewal.

And so that set the tone for the 1900 rediscovery of Mendel and the creation of the so-called

neo-Darwinian view in which Darwin is censored.

The genetics industry was committed to this idea of the mortal body being a machine,

and the mechanistic reductionist approach to biology is strongly based on those religious –

Mendel did it for religious glory and Weissman did it for who knows what.

So speaking of genes and evolution, I guess at this point it's probably clear that genes are not the drivers of evolution.

They're just simply the result of it, right?

So these attempts to drive evolution by the modern genetics establishment by messing with the genes,

they're not really affecting evolution at all.

If you want to affect evolution, you should be modifying – you should be modulating the energetic supply,

which is exactly what they're not doing. Am I reading this right?

Yes. Sidney Fox, in demonstrating that his artificial cells could not only assimilate nutrients

and increase their size and numbers, but he added the makings of nucleic acids,

just the free bases that our DNA synthase system turns into genes.

He fed these nucleic acid precursors to his protocells,

and they – with only the spontaneously formed proteins,

they polymerized the precursors into DNA-like substances.

In terms of – do you think there are missing pieces in the current theory of evolution?

You know, the one that's being taught in schools right now.

I mean, for example, they're saying that humans and chimpanzees are very close relatives,

and they descend from a common ancestor, but there's no archaeological evidence,

at least that's what they claim, that has ever been found of a common ancestor of these two species.

What do you make out of that?

All kinds of alternatives are possible.

For example, one that a vegan tribe decided to restrict their diet to leaves and an occasional bug,

and that caused them to expand their digestive system and get big bellies,

and to not be able to support such big brains, and they turned out looking like chimpanzees.

And if you look at the implications of what Sidney Fox did,

that amino acids spontaneously make proteins which spontaneously are able to make analogs of DNA,

then you've got the central dogma of the Watson-Crick approach to genetics.

They said that information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, never the other way.

But Sidney Fox showed that information is generated spontaneously in proteins,

and that they can then insert order in the precursors and actually make DNA from protein.

So it completely shows the experimental basis, energy basis, for reversing the Watson-Crick approach.

I posted a clip of us talking about evolution, and one of the comments was,

"How could what Ray was talking about be possible, because everybody knows we evolved under very harsh circumstances?"

And so in your point of view, is that possible, like we evolved during an ice age or some really unfavorable scenario?

Oh, I think the real evolution was happening in the tropics with good diet and happiness,

and that when people drifted off trying wheat-based industry and agriculture,

that some of them created the dairy industry and turned out to continue evolving.

Others didn't do so well and degenerated into war-loving tribes and countries.

But like a level deeper of that, like the achievement of the human organism that would have to have been maintained in an oxidized redox balance,

and that would be impossible under extremely harsh conditions. Is that right?

Yeah. Just the whole idea that the brain requires an abundance of energy flowing through the organism to develop,

and the whole fantasy that magic like cosmic rays, for example, breaking genes.

People have been looking at the effect of mutations on proteins now for a hundred years, and they've never created a better gene.

Yeah, speaking of which.

I have friends who work in genetics, and we've had these exact same arguments.

They said, "Look, our field has been trying for over a hundred years to create new species in the lab, and we've been unsuccessful."

And I said, "Well, what have you been doing?"

"Well, we've been blasting them with ionizing radiation. We've been exposing them to mutagens.

We've been stressing the cells in all kinds of different ways.

And yes, they do mutate, but they don't appear to be creating new types of organisms."

And those people are walking around free in society.

That's true. They're actually in a pretty high place, too. They're not peons either.

Yeah. You would think some kind of a growth mental defect was involved in such silly ideas.

So speaking of growth mental defect, do you think the redox balance and the way a well-differentiated organism depends on the intensity of the metabolism and the redox balance being heavily in favor of oxidation,

do you think the same thing happens at the mental level?

The ability to hold a diversity of ideas and to see each new piece of information as expanding your horizon rather than limiting it?

Would that also be kind of like the analogy of the well-differentiated mind, which requires an oxidative metabolism?

Yeah. And it also requires a surrounding world that responds in some sense, that gives it scope for development,

rather than the idea that competition between individuals drives improvement.

There's no more evidence for that than for X-rays causing evolution.

That's right. There was an article that came out maybe about five years ago, which said that—and of course it was immediately vilified, and it was in the Nature Journal.

It said that all the evidence that we have so far indicates that when organisms thrive, they regress.

And I thought, then how is it possible that this is the driving force of evolution, that we should be seeing more and more primitive life forms?

It would be evolution in reverse.

Yeah. That's really a sociopolitical argument, that for your own good, we're starving you.

Exactly. You should tighten up your belt because it's better for you, right? You've been losing weight.

Yeah.

Semi-related, but Ray, you had quoted David Bohm in one of your articles, and you said, "The being of matter is its meaning. The being of ourselves is meaning.

The being of society is meaning. The mechanistic view has created a rather crude and gross meaning, which has created a crude and gross and confused society."

So that ties into—

That's an example of something that is so true that it's very funny.

Do you think this whole idea that I think Western civilization is kind of driving towards in the last 100 years, that they've managed to convince people that simply being is not enough, and that basically people are now like restless.

They can't sit still and they can't enjoy themselves simply living their lives because they're constantly being told, "You just have to do something meaningful with your life."

Do you think there's a more nefarious purpose behind these political messages?

Especially when they're combined with the impossibility of doing something meaningful to yourself.

That creates a rather confused and almost suicidal human being, right? Because you're always failing.

Yeah. You must do this, but you're only permitted to do what we say is meaningful.

We talked about a quote from Maslow the last livestream, and he said something like, "The only happy people I know are the ones doing work that they feel is meaningful."

How many people can say that they do that?

Yeah. Occasionally a person gets in a position where it's possible, but usually the ones who do that quickly get fired.

But occasionally that can work within the system, but it's the great exception.

Are you familiar with those studies from the 1960s that showed that doing altruistic work for others activates the neocortex and actually makes it grow?

And doing stuff entirely for yourself only activates the lizard brain and actually shrinks the total brain volume?

I don't remember seeing those, but it sounds logical.

Okay. Do you think it's possible that somebody would have a meaningful life doing nothing except satisfying their own needs, often at the detriment of others?

No. That experiment you mentioned shows exactly that you need meaning to include everyone and ideally the whole ecosystem benefiting from your project.

So in order for meaningfulness to increase, other people need to be involved, so you should be investing in the environment instead of investing in yourself, as the current mantra goes.

Yeah.

So the elite are motivated by some type of self-loathing type of situation. They're not satisfied in any way, shape, or form.

Yeah. I think at an early stage in life, they swallowed and believed an image of themselves that someone told them what they were.

And they're stuck in that mistaken image of what any organism is. But all of our societies tend to do that, to tell little kids who they are and what they are and what the rules are.

And unless you see yourself as deeply involved in your project, that you're defining and discovering yourself in the process of what you're doing.

That's part of what altruism does to the brain, that your sense of self is based on this defining yourself constantly through experience and assimilating the viewpoints of others to expand your experience.

And then ideally working for the expansion of everyone's experience.

But if you're stuck on a model of what you are, you're this particular historical entity, usually with religious imagery.

This imposed idea of what you are is going to say that your destiny is to serve that image and look for power, for example, power and wealth,

so that that early implanted image of you survives and thrives, rather than constantly looking at the world as part of your own definition to complete understanding of yourself.

You have to keep going into the world.

Have you noticed that some of the most pathological people, some of the most evil ones, tend to come from either religions or social practices that seem to involve self-mutilation or mutilation of very young people?

Circumcision is probably the one that's the most commonly practiced.

Do you think that plays a role into traumatizing these young minds very early on and they basically grow up to hate the world and try to revenge, I guess, for the rest of their lives?

Yeah. I don't know if we talked about this before, but a guy at Oxford, J.D. Unwin, argued that civilization comes from repression and sexual unhappiness drives the high creative societies.

But what a creative society is, is one that makes war and conquers everyone around it.

And he looked at the records of advanced and simple civilizations and drew that generalization that repression and body negating processes lead to essentially the war-making high civilizations.

A guy working at the National Institutes of Mental Health in the 1960s published an article in the Journal of the Atomic Scientists on body pleasure.

And I forget the rest of the title, but looking at these same 80 or 81 or 2 very detailed records of societies at all levels and found that all kinds of body mutilation, circumcision, lip expanding,

earrings, tattoos, the whole range of body mutilation goes with hierarchy in the society.

Women and children are under control and inferior in status.

Enemies are basically to be killed or subordinated.

Basically the outlook of high civilizations even if they're just a very nasty tribe somewhere.

They didn't mutilate the children and didn't suppress women and repress sexuality.

These were peaceful with their neighbors.

So do you think in regards to pleasure and freedom and being able to participate in activities that sort of enhance your well-being,

do you think that may partially explain the fact that almost every culture around the world was found to dabble into either alcohol or psychedelics or other things, mind enhancing substances.

And those that most often did that seemed to achieve, at least in the past, pretty high levels of civilization?

Yeah, and they were not warlike. In Central America the drug using cultures were generally civilized by ordinary ideas of culture and civilization.

But they had highly developed arts and weren't interested in conquering people.

Yeah, and the medicine too. I think the Incas were able to perform brain surgeries like a thousand years before medicine even knew what scalpel was.

Yeah, the Northern Europeans were still very barbaric when the Incas and other Central and South American cultures, Abyssinia, cultures all around the world were highly civilized

when Northern Europeans were still slaughtering each other, very, very crude societies.

Speaking of early childhood traumatizing experiences, do you think the current environment of "encouraging women," they're really being forced for a variety of economic reasons

to sort of dump their children into these mass scale childcare facilities at the age of four to eight weeks and then go back to work,

do you think that has a similar effect of, not maybe the same as circumcision, but parental neglect? It's surely stressful for a baby, wouldn't it be?

Yeah, and that version of feminism was strongly promoted by the CIA through people like, what's her name?

Gloria Steinem.

Gloria Steinem, yeah. Turning women into aggressive, competitive competition for men.

There was that Jaffe-Berelson memo between Planned Parenthood and I think, or the people that wrote it, worked for the Rockefeller Foundation later,

where they were trying to get women into the workplace and they were saying like, restraining childcare and promoting different aspects of culture to do that.

So, yeah.

Did you have any more questions about cultural things, George?

Yeah, I just had one, but it just flew out of my mind, I guess I have to remember. Oh yes, the different versions of feminism.

I mean, I first 12 to, I guess, maybe almost 15 years of my life, because communism officially ended in Bulgaria in 1989,

but sort of like stumbled, continued to sort of partially survive until maybe three or four years later.

But the version of feminism promoted in socialist societies, at least part of the Soviet bloc, was very different than the feminism that I see being promoted here.

Is there a reason for that, do you think?

Because the way the socialism, at least the idea was that women are allowed to do what they want with their lives,

and the state is supposed to help them out, not force them into specific careers or sort of like force them to abandon their children.

I mean, to this day, if you go to like certain European countries, there are two to three years of paid maternity leave, and they get their full salary.

Yeah, the CIA's feminist program was exactly an anti-socialist feminism program,

because what you just described is absolutely destructive to the capitalist ethic.

So they basically said, oh, this is what the commies are doing, and if you're a good capitalist woman, you embrace our version of feminism and not what the Reds are trying to sell you on.

Right, right. Become an aggressive, money-seeking male equivalent.

Do you think that the term toxic masculinity also has its roots in the CIA-driven culture?

Yeah, machismo is one of these implanted ideas.

It defines you, what you can become and how you should behave early as a child.

Four or five years old, it's already embedded.

And that machismo implant is just one side of the CIA feminist implant.

Was there at any point in, I guess, the 20th century, did you notice the CIA or the powers that be kind of getting concerned that socialist ideas are spreading to America, especially like the socialist version of feminism?

Was there kind of like a counter movement here saying like, oh, don't listen to the propaganda, the Reds are trying to brainwash you?

Was there ever a concern that basically the Soviets may be winning the war of the minds?

Oh, yeah. That was the motive for the Congress for cultural freedom.

Very, very conscious of people like John Dewey was already working on it.

As far as anyone knows, free of the secret police, but definitely in harmony with them.

And these preexisting pro-capitalist ideas were scooped up by the CIA.

And when they saw the real danger of the ideal of ideology, of more or less libertarian approach to self-determining individualism in the socialist countries, the CIA created the Congress for cultural freedom,

which was to pick out things that could be promoted in all of the cultures as the ultimate product of free enterprise.

And they got philosophical and economic leaders in the various countries to organize this, take money from the CIA, which was diverting it from the Marshall Plan, vast amounts of money that were intended to restore Europe.

The CIA was using to indoctrinate, create exhibitions of art and concerts and journals, journals of science, technology, economics, politics, philosophy, everything subsidized by the CIA.

It was a huge, huge fountain of money going into particular CIA-approved ideology, all intended to counter the danger of those liberating aspects of the socialist idea.

Speaking of the powers that be manipulating society, I mean, I remember very vividly this.

I think you had the discussion with Danny about the origins of the HIV virus and how you got approached by a guy in Oregon back in, I think it was the '60s or the '70s, when he said he used to work at Fort Dedrick and said there was a virus that was created to target specific racial groups.

Well, do you think something like this may have happened or at least was designed initially to happen with the contraceptive pill?

Or do you think it was entirely done just for profits?

Because it cannot have evaded the attention of the powers that be that giving estrogen to women tends to masculinize them and really twist their behavior, like basically make them act not only like males but like really psychopathic males.

Yeah, the Nazis introduced estrogen for use in the slave camps, concentration camps, because it made them into authoritarian people who would follow orders and, if necessary, harm their fellow inmates.

Is there anything published on that or was it entirely just like an anecdote?

Barbara Seaman was the one that gathered up some of the information. I think her book has references to where she found it.

Okay. So do you think, because the initial contraceptives were pure estrogen and then they started adding these toxic synthetic progestins at some point, was this just to appease the Catholic Church because the Catholic Church was starting to wisen up on the idea that the estrogen pills were actually abortion pills, they're not contraceptives?

Yeah, it was the fact proven in the 1930s. My thesis advisor at the University of Oregon worked on the fact that estrogen at any level is creating abortions.

If it has been implanted for two weeks or a month or two months, the dose has to be bigger, but you get the same contraceptive effect.

But they all work after conception has happened, so at every level, estrogen since the 1930s has been known to be an abortion pill.

It was only in the early 1950s when they started thinking of a way to sell it as something other than an abortion pill, and they called it a contraceptive with absolutely no evidence.

But that was just a sales point to shut the Church up.

Ray, what do you think about all the toxic masculinity, the racism, and all the things that occupy the minds of a lot of Americans, that psychological operation and those topics ramping up after Occupy Wall Street?

Somebody was Google trending those terms and it was showing a steep incline right after around 2011. Maybe the Occupy Wall Street really scared the powers that be?

What term?

Like the topics that were allowed to talk about, the racism, the toxic masculinity, feminist intersectionality, all those types of things.

Yeah, the control of Occupy Wall Street. You know, the government allowed the industries to have snipers ready overlooking the demonstrations, ready to shoot the leaders if things go wrong.

If things got out of hand.

The government was completely sympathetic to treating it the way things happened in Ukraine.

There were snipers shooting people on both sides to rouse the crowds against the government.

And the point was to kill the leaders if the movement started being successful.

And so the surrounding apparatus, everything from assassination down has been put into action.

Have you noticed, I think what Danny was asking, have you noticed that throughout critical periods of history in the Western world, whenever the powers that be feel threatened by a specific movement,

they immediately start invoking these controlled opposition themes such as racism, feminism, not that they're not real topics,

but they immediately provoked or immediately invoked to sort of like shift attention away from the real problem, which is the existence of the haves and the have nots?

Yeah. Divide and conquer idea.

You have people putting their attention on things that they were mostly not issues in the socialist countries, but they made them issues specifically.

And the transgender thing that never would have taken off by itself, but it was promoted by government and industry as part of the distraction.

What was the distraction that was used around, let's say, when Kennedy was shot or MLK was shot?

What did they pull out of the sleeve back then?

A discussion of whether it was Russia or Cuba that was responsible.

Did it capture the public imagination or what did the public see right through it?

Oh, no. Total capture. At first, there were only three or four skeptics publishing and it took 20, 30, 40 years to develop a fairly sizable skeptical population.

Did nobody question the fact that the chairman of the Kennedy Commission, wasn't it one of the Dulles brothers?

Wasn't it what?

One of the Dulles brothers. Wasn't he the chairman of the Kennedy Commission?

Alan Dulles, yeah, the whole thing on its face. Anyone who was paying attention immediately knew it was a coup. But like MS Arnone had a little newsletter called Minority of One.

He immediately gave a detailed analysis of what would happen as a result of this coup.

Absolutely correct. And it was, I think, something like November 27th when he sent it out.

But people who, instead of reading that, maybe a thousand people read it, but everyone else was reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and TV

and hearing the discussion of how Oswald was a Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union and came back and visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico.

And they were, I think they call it sheep dipping. They were creating this legend around him so that when they needed someone to kill and put off the assassination on a victim,

he had this aura of Marxism around him. But he was actually just a normal Texas Marine right winger who worked for the CIA on the U-2 spy plane,

knew the codes needed to use radar to shoot it down, which the Soviets hadn't had.

So then they had him with that information defect to the Soviets. And then when he was in place and they wanted to block Eisenhower's attempt to establish detente with a summit meeting in May of 1960,

they flew the U-2 plane, Gary Powers flew it, over the appropriate rocket sites with the information Harvey Oswald had and got it shot down.

Or if that failed, it probably had a self-destruct bomb in it. Anyway, they arranged for it to fall and interrupt the detente Eisenhower had in mind as his legacy for ending the presidency.

And when his job in the U-2 business was finished, he came back and they continued the creation of this aura around him by having him join the Fair Play for Cuba committee,

get in the news by having a fight with the anti-Castro people, get on the radio, interviewed as a Marxist member of the Fair Play for Cuba committee, which he wasn't really,

and distribute leaflets in the street, pseudo-Marxist propaganda. But the address for getting in contact with him on this leaflet was the same address that the CIA and FBI used in New Orleans.

So they didn't do a very thorough job of cutting his connections with the CIA, which had eventually been brought out.

Are you familiar with the interviews of this lady called Kay Griggs? She describes all of these things that you just mentioned in great detail as well.

She was married to the chairman of NATO's Committee for International Policy. I don't know what exactly, but he was basically involved in multiple assassinations.

She talks about how that, what was that, the head of the United Nations that was killed in Africa? It was a Swedish guy?

Dag Hammarskog?

Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah, she has a number of different interviews, and she talks a lot about the – basically the entire army is just a muscle for the corporations and how everything is just a big economic game, and then basically the CIA, the FBI, all of these are just enforcement arms of the industry.

But anyways, long story short, so you said that most of the public happily gobbled up whatever false story was given about the Kennedy assassination, the MLK assassination.

So we should – I guess we're living in better times these days because it looks like at least half the nation is at least greatly suspicious, even if they don't know the whole truth.

Half of the nation does not believe the official story that is being fed to it by mainstream media at this point.

I think that's part of the reason that the Great Reset is going so fast now, using the pandemic virus as a way to take information control,

to turn the whole society into a robotized, smart, artificial intelligence-controlled system just because of the – well, the unrest that expressed itself in Trumpism.

Half of the population is very disgusted with the Clinton, Obama type of government wanting something radically different.

But they're afraid it could turn into something more constructive and more dangerous to them.

So basically now that there's a critical number of people who just mistrust anything that the official – that the powers that be are telling them, they're saying, "Oh, crap. We better hurry up because we don't have much time left."

Yeah, and they're hoping that being subservient enough to get vaccinated repeatedly and by the hundreds of millions that this is going to drive their control faster and faster.

What do you think they will do considering that the official – even the mainstream media says seven out of ten people are now saying they will not voluntarily get the vaccine even if they get paid to do it?

Do you think at that point they may start getting the military involved and saying, "You know what? It's not going to be a choice"?

Yeah, I just saw a video of a guy in a military uniform saying that with the emergency authorization of the FDA, that the military is getting organized to vaccinate 100% of the population within 24 hours simultaneous.

And that's vaccination of the whole population.

But how is that going to do it? The military is what, like five million people total? How are they going to vaccinate 300 million people?

Probably deputizing local police.

Okay.

These article titles are like they're from the Onion. "Vaccine safety to remain unclear until millions get their shots." And then this one, "Doctors say CDC should warn people the side effects from COVID vaccine shots won't be a walk in the park."

Do you think they're preparing people that there's going to be side effects and almost like incepting the idea into people's heads so they can't complain about it?

Well, the fact that they're starting with the minorities under the guise of fairness and equality, but they want the millions of minorities to be the ones to take the first testing risk.

Did you see, I mean, you probably haven't seen it because it's a tiny state. It's not a real state. I live in DC, Ray, and they recently passed a law under the cover of COVID-19 emergency.

Now they're allowing children as young as 11 to self-consent to vaccination behind their parents' backs.

And actually the law makes it gives full retractive immunity to doctors, school personnel, insurance companies, whatnot. And they actually require them to lie to their parents.

If the parents call and say, "Did my child get vaccinated?" They're legally allowed to say no.

So what is your plan if this gets to the point where now it's actually getting to the point, at least in DC, where these vaccinations will be mandatory? Would that be your, essentially, the point at which you say, "I'm going to leave"?

Yeah, and that's the point at which they'll seal the borders.

You have to present your certificate before they allow you to leave.

Well, speaking of the vaccine, there was a Forbes article and it was talking about how the vaccines were targeted for mild symptoms and not for the communicable nature of the virus.

And so nothing you don't know, these vaccine trials were set up to totally fail.

But I think the average American would think vaccination means freedom from disease. And so I think there is a bait and switch going on here.

Yeah, the irrationality is more than sufficient at every level you look at it. You don't have to figure much to discover the funniness of it when you see every bit of things that they're advocating is irrational.

If the mRNA protein that the vaccine contains codes for the spike protein of the virus, don't you think there's a significant risk that in susceptible people, which probably there are more than enough of those, this vaccine may actually lead to very serious side effects, potentially death.

And if they start mass vaccinations, we're going to start seeing that at a mass scale and the public will quickly get spooked.

Yeah, the spike protein causes inflammation by inactivating the enzyme that inactivates angiotensin.

So spike protein essentially turns on our inflammatory system, the angiotensin system, and the RNA allows our own cells to manufacture the spike protein.

So we are being prepared to manufacture the activator of our own inflammatory system, which is basically the only thing that causes people to die from COVID if they die from it.

And mostly, none of that diagnosis or determination of the cause of death, none of that has been done in a traditional scientific manner.

So if we don't do that, to the extent that the virus is harmful to weak people, then it's causing our body to produce the agent that kills people.

So we ignore the fact that we have reverse transcriptases that can turn RNA into DNA and integrate it into our genes so that we can pass on the ability to destroy our defenses against inflammation.

What do you think is the onset of action? I mean, what's the time period for onset of action of this potentially highly inflammatory response to the vaccine? Is it days? Is it weeks? Is it hours?

To do what?

I mean, once you get injected with this mRNA, how long before the proverbial bull crap hits the fan?

It depends on whether it's spreading by reverse transcriptase. It could happen within the first day or two. And some of the test victims have become very sick within just a day or two.

But there are so many counter defenses. The adrenal and other glands can increase to overcome those inflammatory effects.

But if your body then increases the production of the spike protein, you could get cycles of inflammation coming and being overcome and recurring indefinitely.

If you look at the officially published side effects of the vaccines, and not even saying that article that Danny mentioned, CDC said, oh, Moderna or Pfizer should be more forthcoming with people about the potential side effects of the vaccines.

And that article says, oh, the side effects of the vaccines are the same as COVID. So I'm thinking, wow, how convenient.

So now they're going to administer the vaccine to all of these elderly people, probably in Florida or God knows where, that are already compromised. They're going to start dying in droves.

And then we're going to get told that, oh, no, it's not the vaccine that killed them. They contracted COVID. So it doesn't hinder the vaccination campaign.

Yeah, that's a nice development. The flu vaccine is well established as a destructive influence on the immune system, increasing your likelihood to contract non-influenza respiratory viruses.

And so the industry just isn't looking at the outcome of a big population that follows a year or two or three years after a big influenza vaccinating campaign.

The immune system is damaged by every vaccination. And you have to look at the long range outcome from any vaccine. And that's going to be a lot worse with an RNA virus vaccine.

Is the mRNA aspect of this, is there some tech that they need for kind of the future, what they want to do, the surveillance type of thing? Do you see any connection between the two, Ray?

In vaccinating the whole population, they've got everyone located and subservient and they don't really need to do the injected chips and all of that stuff because just the process of rounding them up and vaccinating them once,

they're entered into the system.

But like, is there a reason this technology is being employed now or is it just totally, just a crazy experiment that's made even crazier by these being the first mRNA vaccines?

I think Klaus Schwartz made it very clear a few years ago with his book that this is a very convenient way to bring on very quickly the corporate system of control.

Finances, education, shopping, medicine, long range medicine through the computer.

He has explained that all of this is going to be the only way out for society if it doesn't quickly get everything under control, then there will be outbreaks of barbarism.

People in the chat, we've talked about this, but people in the chat are asking about how to protect yourself from this vaccine, but I'll interject that one, I think there's two shots of the coronavirus vaccine.

And then, correct me if I'm wrong, Ray, but the Rockefeller Foundation, they released some paper projected future scenario where they said the ideal situation was to get a vaccine every week.

And so it's not like protection from this one time vaccine that people are going to be forced to get.

At some point, people will have to take a stand because it's not going to end.

Yeah, the Chinese, when they identified the virus, found there were five versions of it already existing different places around the world, especially in the United, eastern United States.

And if there were five versions that early, we can probably figure there are now maybe 25 different andogenic versions, variations of the virus.

And next year, there might be 125 variations. And so naturally, a weekly vaccination would be an attempt to keep up with the mutation of the virus, but obviously insane.

I did read this little bit about Pfizer.

They say set up a secret of trials in Kano, the second largest city in Nigeria to test an experimental antibiotic Trovan, Trova, Flaxacin, and just how evil Pfizer is and they didn't let these people get the money for for killing these kids and asking them for DNA samples and the, and these are the companies that we're supposed to trust for this warps B vaccine.

Speaking of Pfizer, a former vice president at Pfizer, Michael Yadon, Y-E-A-D-O-N, has a half hour video that's very good, especially the last two minutes of it.

Just a very blunt description of how serious it is and how essential it is that, as he said, right thinking people stamp out this deadly hoax of a pandemic.

And speaking of protection from the vaccines, I've looked at some of the adjuvants and in previous vaccines, there isn't much information on the current ones, but they're all the adjuvants seem to act by activating the endotoxin receptor, TLR4.

And also this mRNA vaccine, it relies on the on the cells producing RNA for the spike protein and the tetracycline antibiotics are known to inhibit the synthesis of foreign RNA by the cell.

So, in other words, even though they're antibiotics, they seem to be able to inhibit the production of viral RNA by cells if the cells get infected.

So wouldn't something like a TLR4 blocker combined with a tetracycline antibiotic, some of which are also antagonists of that receptor themselves, wouldn't something like that be a decent protection against mRNA vaccines?

To some extent, yeah. Azithromycin has a kind of anti-inflammatory. I think that's the major benefit of erythro or azithromycin and the tetracyclines is they're very strong anti-inflammatory effects.

But what about the -- I've seen some articles saying that studies showing that the tetracycline antibiotics are capable of suppressing the production of foreign body RNA, especially from viruses, but they don't inhibit the normal cells production of its own RNA.

Do you think that may be used as a defensive mechanism against this vaccine?

Yep, that sounds reasonable.

Okay. So which one do you think is more dangerous, the adjuvant, which is triggering this inflammatory response, or the mRNA, which -- well, I guess the final response is the production of the protein.

The ingredients of the Pfizer vaccine suggest that it contains no adjuvant. It lists two lipids with a mysterious code number, and that's traditional that the FDA allows people to use a made-up name to identify something on the label so that you don't really know what it is.

But they list these two lipids in inert ingredients. The only active ingredient is the RNA.

But these two lipids, if you Google them, you don't find that particular code number, but what you find is companies selling lipids that can be used as a solvent in vaccines as simply a passive carrier that would let you list it as an inert ingredient.

But also the very same lipids are sold as adjuvants.

So just by a double naming identity, they claim that their vaccine has no adjuvant, but meanwhile, the similar lipids are being sold widely as vaccine adjuvants.

Is PUFU by itself an adjuvant? Doesn't PUFU injected directly into the bloodstream cause a similar response?

Yeah, that's the essence of the lipid adjuvant effect.

Okay. So do you think that's the -- because we don't know what those lipids are, do you think that may be the more dangerous part that they're not letting the public in on what may be -- it's not so much the mRNA protein, but it's one of those unknown things that are there?

Yeah. The great alternative in the vaccine industry to aluminum for several years now has been lipids.

And so they would have to identify the specific lipid and then show evidence that it's not a wide spectrum adjuvant before anyone should believe that.

Right. With our last conversation, you called Biden winning. Do we want to talk about this at all?

Like, what does this mean for the next 10 years that Biden, it seems like, will be in the White House?

And he's tweeting a lot and he's saying things like he promises things are going to get better.

What do you make of that?

Oh, it's almost all the same delusion that we've been suffering from for 50, 100 years, that things are always getting better as power becomes more centralized.

And he's promised and continues to choose the people for his cabinet.

He's promised that Wall Street will like his program and the people in charge of foreign policy and the Pentagon are the biggest warmongers in the country.

Do you think he'll be able to survive a four-year period? I mean, the guy looks like just he's about to fall apart.

Like he doesn't seem any healthier than Hillary Clinton. Remember when she collapsed several times during the primaries when she was arguing with Donald Trump?

Like after that, they literally dragged her out to her van and like her feet were dragging on the curb.

I mean, he seems he seems of about the same level of health as her.

Yeah, he does look very weak when he's talking.

I don't know if the video was doctored, but there's one circulating that shows him talking about the biblical Psalms, quoting from one of the Psalms, but he's calling them "Poms."

Well, people were reading the "Poms."

People were joking saying he's the first deep fake president because like his announcements seem like they're on a green screen or something. They look really fake.

There was a Zero Hedge article, Ray, and it said Joe Biden, the return of the CFR. And isn't the CFR intertwined closely with the CIA? So Biden will be doing their bidding very closely.

Oh, absolutely. He's never denied that. The people that were the warmongers from Obama's government went into business as, in effect, industry representatives.

But they simply gave industry people detailed instructions who to talk to and what to say to them instead of getting involved directly as a lobbyist.

They were doing illegal lobbying, but making it technically legal by putting it at arm's length.

And these people – I think it was the one chosen for Secretary of Defense who said that building bridges between Silicon Valley's defense industry and the Pentagon was a work of love.

That's what Eric Schmidt is doing, right?

Yeah, the whole system is ready to pop into action immediately in January, establishing the Great Reset.

I don't know what day the Davos meeting occurs where the meeting is called the Great Reset, but it will basically coincide with Biden starting to apply the Great Reset.

I wish I put it in my notes, but the World Economic Forum was talking – or they did some simulation of cyber polygon.

So they're cooking up all different types of things for the future apparently of cyber attacks and food shortages.

Is there anything you think is more likely to happen that you've read about, Ray?

They really need to control the food industry and medical industry.

Those are things that will make people do anything to get medical care and food.

Well, what do you mean in terms of controlling the medical industry?

They fully own it at this point.

Are you saying they're going to start mandating people to go to a doctor or…?

Yeah, just making it possible only for those who are totally subservient, vaccinated, and willing to accept the terms.

So only those people will be allowed to buy food, that kind of thing?

Yeah.

The people that haven't been destroyed by the lockdowns, do you think the cyber polygon or some cyber attack or resetting people to zero, do you think that's on the horizon?

Or do you think there's something else?

Because what about the people that can still maintain a living even if they didn't have their small businesses eviscerated by the lockdowns?

If you have land and some trees and animals, you're momentarily able to resist, but they'll just increase the taxes on your land and give it to a corporation when the time is right.

So I have a question. All this great reset and the new economic policy and whatnot, I mean money, at least in a normal world, derives its value from people and their interactions with each other.

If they're so consistently decimating the population all over the world, wouldn't that devalue, in a sense, the wealth that they have?

Or do you think they'll come up with some other way of continuously continue to get richer even if the population is declining?

When you have absolute control, then you can create only the wealth that you need and the useless eaters will get none of it.

And so it'll be a better organized kind of wealth.

But if it's funny money, so to speak, if it's not based on anything of value, how are they going to convince other competitors on the world stage, such as China or Russia or India, in other words, countries that can put up a fight?

How are they going to convince them that this money has value?

Because ultimately it comes down to using that money for resources or whatever it is that they want that these countries, that the other countries have.

China is going to say, I don't need your fake dollars or fake currency or Bitcoin, right?

And same with Russia.

Yeah, Libya was at the point of doing that, and that was quickly dispatched by killing Libya.

And they know that Russia getting together with China and the whole reorganization of the Middle East with their influence, that that is a deadly threat.

And so World War III is their solution.

There's no rational solution.

If enough other countries get involved, the Great Reset can be stopped.

For example, starting by occupying Taiwan or Formosa and taking it away from any relation with China, that would be a way of threatening and trying to get China under control.

By threatening to annihilate them with nuclear weapons.

But if China resists, then we have nuclear war, basically the end of life on the planet.

So the only real hope is that a lot of other countries start breaking free from the empire so that the Great Reset has to be rethought.

So even the Great Reset is really just a means to an end. The ultimate thing is, as long as countries like Russia and China exist and they're naturally now aligning the interests against the empire, that's a deadly threat to the empire, right?

Yeah. Eric Schmidt outlined it several years ago, saying that China is now on track to defeat the US economically.

And the only way we can keep our control is by shutting down everything, including Chinese industry, and replacing it with artificial intelligence under our control.

Because China was threatening to be the masters of the artificial intelligence industry.

But instead of destroying China's economy along with the world economy, the US economy was I think a 20% decline, 10 to 20% loss of productivity.

And China just went from very fast growth to moderate growth. So they didn't get set back by the pandemic. In fact, their position relative to the United States lurched ahead.

So that was a great mistake that will have important outcomes.

Right. But I'm saying is that let's say the Great Reset succeeds. Ultimately, that's not enough. All of this industry, including the AI, is very energy hungry.

It will still come down to somehow snatching those resources out of the hands of China and Russia, which can only happen by war.

Right.

Okay. So I guess what you are saying at some point is either the empire crumbling or engaging at the very least Russia and China into some kind of like either conventional or nuclear war over resources.

Yeah.

Something I didn't realize until a week ago was the technocratic slave grid made possible by collecting all this info is to develop the AI in an arms race with China.

Is that the way you see it, Ray?

Say that again?

Like the accumulation of data about the citizenry is to form an AI to compete with China. Is that right?

No. I think that's separate.

They just hope to pour money into selected industries to develop more powerful digital surveillance.

And in the background, doing all of the manipulation of the population, that's one thing, but concentrating on investment in the corporations like building bridges between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon, direct corporate government, essentially corporate military operation.

And that highly developed artificial intelligence then would be directed towards neutralizing China.

Getting ahead of them not just for profitable industrial purposes, but getting ahead for things like inactivating their defense against rockets and airplanes and submarines.

I was reading an article about a year ago saying that China's military program, of course, still highly classified, but they seem to be shifting a significant amount of resources towards developing electromagnetic pulse weapons.

In other words, they're saying that now that the world is so fully digitized, they're thinking that they can either defend themselves or at the very least inflict a pretty severe harm on other countries by plunging them into sort of like the Middle Ages by doing an electromagnetic weapon that will just disable the entire digital grid of a specific country.

So I guess they're expecting that AI that will get heavily involved in the future warfare and planning accordingly.

That was a problem already met about 50 or 60 years ago when they were starting to get computer controls in airplanes, military airplanes.

And they thought that they had the technique to energetically knock out the navigation system.

So they've been working, the US has been working to destroy defense systems for now several decades.

So do you think, I mean, how much value do you assign to that whole concept of AI?

We've discussed it in the past that without consciousness, there can be no true intelligence.

This is all manipulation of structured information that's without context.

It's next to useless.

So what could this AI do other than some very specific task, mostly revolving around computation?

But it's really, I mean, I've worked with AI for at least 15 years at this point.

I am in the IT field and that most of these things that we see on the news, they're just hype and many of them are lies.

Do you really see that much promise?

I mean, even from an economic point of view in this AI concept, because I personally am not sold on it.

No, not at all.

But it's a propaganda scheme for increasing the obedience of people.

If you say that the algorithm will educate you and diagnose you and treat you and do surgery controlled by computers,

that you don't need intelligence anymore for any of these traditional human activities.

And there will be no intelligence at all.

I'll be manipulated like making vaccines appear to be effective by changing the names of the disease.

You change the death records or paralysis records or whatever.

Just rename the particular disease and it has gone away.

And that is used to sell the effectiveness of vaccines.

And it's constantly being done.

Right now they're practicing diagnosis by an entirely intended new baseless set of definitions.

It has nothing to do with determining the cause of sickness or death.

And so the artificial intelligence will be validated in terms of simply changing the rules and the definitions.

So the students educated remotely according to the stereotyped classes that they're presented with,

they will be diagnosed as having outstanding outcomes of their training.

If you control the definition of the outcome, you can make anything look good.

What was that guy from the '60s? He was a civil rights guy.

From a civil rights moment he said the power to define terms is the ultimate power.

George Rubin, I think, or maybe?

Yeah.

Control of language is the ultimate power.

Okay. So in terms of--so here's the thing.

But all of this AI, it has to--again, I'm coming back to the value of money, right?

So I guess now they're going to start changing the definition of what economic growth is

because if this thing is mostly fake--I mean, it's not fake, but if AI is not nearly as great as they're trying to hype it up to be,

then economic growth will continue to lag, real economic growth.

So they have to come up with some other kind of a story as a cover.

Just redefine what growth is.

All of the official government numbers on the economy have been rigged now for about 20 years.

They used to publish the money supply in terms of bank accounts and dollars and investments.

About 20 years ago they stopped making public the actual extent of the money supply

so that they could pump fake money in to keep the stock market climbing.

And same with unemployment figures.

They have rigged it so that most of the working force can be unemployed, and it looks like it's only 4 or 5 percent unemployed

because if you haven't found a job within so many weeks, then you're no longer in the working force.

So you're not counted as unemployed even though technically you are?

Yeah, all of the numbers published by the government are now totally fake for the last 20 years.

Speaking of redefining diseases to explain one with another,

have you noticed, especially at this point in the official mainstream media,

they're saying that the flu season has mysteriously vanished in pretty much every country around the world.

Yeah, you can see that happening the first or second week of April of this year.

Suddenly there was no more influenza.

It fell off a cliff and surging instantaneously.

The same amount of hospitalization and death was taken over by COVID.

Looking at the curve, you can see it's just a change of name.

So the explanation, if you've seen the official articles, is like, well, of course flu is going to disappear

because everybody's been practicing social distancing.

My question then is, so why isn't COVID disappearing as well?

Have you ever seen anybody ask that question?

Which question?

Well, they're saying the flu is disappearing because everybody's been practicing social isolation,

and there's a lockdown, right?

But then why isn't also COVID-19 disappearing?

Aren't they viruses?

So if it works for one, it should work for the other.

Both should be disappearing.

What's happening with COVID-19?

How come it can resist the lockdown and the isolations?

People like Michael Yeadon make it very clear that people are just saying in the almost context-free way,

they're just saying what you should believe with no rationality or evidence to say why you should believe it.

When did the education in the U.S. start to become context-free and teaching and damaging people's minds

to really take everything on faith instead of asking questions?

Was that a gradual process or did it really all fell off a cliff after a certain amount of time?

I think it accelerated after about 1960.

In 1947, through government action, all Lamarckians were fired in high school and colleges.

All Lamarckian teachers disappeared.

And progressively since then, there has been a refinement of education, eliminating dissent in every field.

So basically, do you think there was also something that was driven by the CIA or was it like a more of a concerted government policy?

Nobody has interest in a thinking public?

Yeah, the CIA was there organizing it and orchestrating it, but it had defenders in every agency.

The Pentagon didn't want anyone questioning the harmful effects of radiation,

and so they fired biologists and physics professors who insisted on discussing the effects of biological damage by ionizing radiation.

Every field that impinged on one of the interests of the powers had to be removed from the schools.

I was going to ask, Ray, do you think Michael Yudon is trying to atone for his sins working for Pfizer?

I think he's probably just been in a position where he could perceive the evil that is growing everywhere in the system.

Speaking of, let me—I can read the donations here.

I'll read those real fast.

Fab for five pounds, thank you so much, Fab.

Kana for 1,220 yen, thank you so much, Kana.

Harry Burgos for $20.

Linda Bell for $5, thank you, Harry. Thank you, Linda.

Chris H. for $20, thank you, Chris.

Michelle for $50, thank you so much, Michelle.

Christina Tomaj for $19.99.

All long-term contributors of the show, sincerely appreciate it.

I will forward those directly to Ray.

And, Ray, we usually—I've almost kept you for two hours, you know, conscious of your time.

What are you working on right now?

A newsletter on temperature, the effects of body temperature on everything.

People, for a variety of reasons, have been getting everything wrong.

The rate of aging theory, for example, people were saying you should live slower and colder.

And it led to kind of a fetish of cryotherapy, chilling newborn babies' brains

and dropping the temperature during heart surgery or treating brain injury

and neglecting the harmful effects of lower body temperature,

such as increasing anaphylaxis and allergy and chronic degenerative symptoms.

I love that because I interface with the paleo community so often,

and that is something that has never worked into their ideas,

that the temperature and pulse rate are very important.

I recall from a previous conversation, you were saying the specific mitochondria

or the respiratory enzymes are sensitive to temperature,

but the whole thing just stops when the temperature declines of the cell, right?

Yeah, the redox balance shifts towards inflammation as soon as your oxidation energy slows down.

Did you know, I'm sure you've seen, but even the American Cancer Society

has a page of treating cancer with hyperthermic therapy?

Yeah, I knew someone that I quoted the Italian research on it,

much higher success with prolonged hyperthermia just sitting in a hot box

than all of the conventional treatments for those particular cancers.

So if you heard that the government had approved two or three centers in the U.S.

to test hyperthermic treatment of cancer,

but they had the requirement that they accompanied it by mild radiation treatment.

So she decided that to get the effective heat therapy,

she would give in and have their mild radiation treatment.

And after a couple sessions, she described that they had a heating pad on her abdomen,

and she asked how they knew that it was heating her body.

They said it was controlled by computers.

The computers knew.

And asked her how much radiation she was getting by the second session.

I think it was she had received 800 rads.

Wow.

And they were planning to double that, but she was getting nausea,

radiation poisoning symptoms to such an extent.

I don't think she wanted to continue, but it was a total fraud.

There was no attempt to have an internal thermometer to see if her body was really reaching a therapeutic temperature.

They just had this magic heating pad on her said to be controlled by magic computers.

Yeah, I saw some of the studies that were done in animals.

They achieved up to 60% full cure rate by raising the body temperature to about 40 degrees centigrade.

To 41.

To 41, yeah.

That even old people could tolerate sitting in a box slightly over 40 degrees Celsius for 8 to 10 hours at a time.

So do you think the fact that cancer patients often have bouts of fever,

that's the body's attempt to essentially raise the temperature and treat itself?

Yeah, I think that's what the various unorthodox treatments going back more than 100 years have done.

They activated the fever system to get your temperature up to at least 40 degrees C.

So metabolic encouplers such as dinitrophenol and aspirin,

maybe part of their anti-cancer effects is precisely this raising the body temperature?

Yeah, right.

Aspirin does tremendously increase our respiration rate and heat production,

but the medical world insists on classifying it as a fever breaker.

They won't acknowledge that increasing respiration and heat production will contribute to hypothermia,

but several experiments where they combined it with a smaller dose of caffeine or adrenaline promoting things,

the dose of aspirin tremendously increased the fever produced, the hyperthermia.

So it is a thermogenic substance despite its silly anti-fever reputation.

There was an article that came out maybe two months ago,

and it said that one of estrogen's primary metabolic purpose may very well be the opposition of progesterone's raising of the core body temperature.

So estrogen is a very potent temperature reductant.

Yeah.

Many years ago, a Russian experimenter knew that rabbit ears were very cool compared to the body.

They implanted bits of ovaries into the skin of the ear,

and the animals went into a constant estrus, a sign of continuing increased estrogen production.

So the cooling of the ovaries increases estrogen production.

And when you measure the temperature of the ovary compared to the surrounding tissues,

very weirdly it's about a degree or more cooler than the adrenaline tissues.

Does cortisol also lower core body temperature?

Yeah, except when it's breaking down your protein, severe toxic excess of cortisol will heat you up so much that it will raise your temperature.

But the tendency is to stop the respiratory energy production so it can lower your temperature chronically.

The hyperthermia, how are those people being exposed to the high temperature and it not causing a stress similar to like maybe a very hot shower or sitting in a very hot bath?

You have to keep drinking orange juice.

But are those people having the therapy, keeping their blood sugar up?

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

You tend to faint after an hour or so if you don't replenish your carbohydrate.

And then I think in your autism article you referenced hyperthermia for autism.

Is there some, when you heat up the body, what exactly is happening to presumably reduce serotonin and other mediators of stress?

It does reduce those estrogen related things, but the brain works better for every degree.

It increases up to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

And people have tested the mental performance, reasoning and memory, for example, giving various tests and putting a heating helmet on the effective way we're increasing IQ simply by raising the temperature of the brain.

I was reading articles on metal in blue also being an uncoupler in higher doses.

And I know that back in the day, I think both St. Georgie and Brotobarns and I think Celia noticed that cancer cells preferentially uptake metal in blue precisely because of their highly reductive metabolism.

And I thought that there's also this thing called a photodynamic therapy, which combines red light with metal in blue.

And if tumors preferentially take metal in blue, which is itself an uncoupler, wouldn't the same thing as heating the entire body can be done in a more targeted way by taking some metal in blue and then shining red light on that area of the body where the tumor is?

Yeah, if it's making the tumor blue, then that would absorb the red light.

Okay. I'm thinking as a way of like less, I guess, less risky instead of heating the whole body.

Well, I guess heating the entire body has other benefits, right?

If the brain operates better at high temperature, the brain itself, a better operating brain can control the tumor growth too, even if you're not directly targeting the tumor.

Yeah, as a chronic thing, I think the development of the tumor thrives on the inflammatory environment of a low brain temperature.

So all of these therapies that are promoted now online called cold thermogenesis is essentially asking for trouble?

Yeah.

So we had a few more donations. The Great Awakening for $10. Thank you for that.

David Hendricks for $20. Thank you so much, David. Thank you so much. Great Awakening.

A Jean, long time contributor, as many of these people are, for $20.

B Love for $149. Thank you so much, B Love.

Jackson for $5. Thank you so much, Jackson.

And I'll send those straight to Ray. And Ray, confirm you are receiving my PayPal forwards?

Yep, I think so.

Okay, good. With that, I mean, I could keep asking you questions. Georgie, you have any last burning questions for Ray?

Nope, I think we should allow the man to eat. He's been with us for two hours.

Again, sincerely appreciate you joining us, Ray. Thank you, Georgie. Ray, any parting words?

Nope.

Actually, can you let people know how to subscribe to your newsletter and purchase your books?

Raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. That's the address for both newsletter and books.

And then they can order back issues as well by emailing that address?

Yeah.

Awesome. Okay.

One last question from me. What's the status of the digitization project for your books?

Because you mentioned a couple of months ago, I think, that you're working on that.

Yeah, I don't know of any progress. It's partly intention, but it'll come along.

Will they be in a PDF format or just available to a library? What's the end goal here?

Getting it more accessible easily is the basic goal.

Okay. But what I'm saying is that would they be similar to the newsletter, be distributed in a file,

or would it be through a library where people will go and be able to browse and maybe buy or rent or whatnot?

I think getting it downloaded to the readers is probably the best.

Okay. Thank you.

Amazing. Thank you so much, Ray. Ray, stay on the line. Georgie, thank you so much.

Thank you, listeners. Thank you, everybody watching, liking.

This show will be on BitChute and every other place this show is available in a few hours,

so I'll do some work after this to make it available for those.

Thank you, everybody. We have an amazing listenership. Sincerely appreciate it.

Have a safe weekend. Take care, everyone. Talk to you guys soon. Okay. Bye, everyone.

Stay safe.

[Music]Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.

Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base

and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

What if free people could live secure in the knowledge

that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack,

that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?

I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished by the British.

Their technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this year,

may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

Space shuttle is very difficult to do, one would think.

Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

Thank you guys for joining us. Raymond Peat, Georgi Dinkov.

Ray, how are you? How are things in Eugene, Oregon?

Very good. The usual cold, wet and dark winter.

And Georgi, how are things in DC?

Dark, but for different reasons.

It's just the political climate is murkier than it was a week ago.

We had some snow yesterday, but it's all melted by now. It's just cold and windy, but dry.

I want to devolve into political things, but first I want to tackle Ray's newsletter.

Ray, maybe giving us an elevator pitch and going through and talking about your newsletter,

Body Temperature, Inflammation and Aging. I think that would be a great place to start.

Then we could swing into political things. Maybe give us your motivation for writing it.

I've just been watching for many years people, doctors, like a totally psychotic woman.

Her brother said, but isn't it significant that her eardrum temperature is only 96 degrees?

And the doctor said, oh, but that's normal for these people.

And about 40 years ago, a woman supposedly with dementia,

she couldn't find her way home if she was let out of the house by herself.

She mentioned that her temperature had been as low as 92 degrees.

And when she took a little progesterone and got her body warm,

she returned to graduate school and got straight A's for a master's degree.

So just warming up the brain five or six degrees, you can gain about 60 or 70 IQ points.

And when I was working on physiology of hamster aging,

I noticed that there were some changes that worked under the influence of either temperature or hormones.

And estrogen, which lowers your temperature, happened to cause microtubules to appear.

And progesterone, which actually raised the temperature, had the opposite effect on the microtubules.

And I started thinking about the effect of cold and hot water

when the microtubules are sensitive to the structural temperature of the water,

how much order there is in it. And there are lots of enzymes in our cells

that are structurally sensitive to the temperature of the environment, for example,

to the degree that as the temperature goes down,

some enzymes are suddenly totally inactivated while others are activated.

And so it isn't just a chemical reaction, but it's a shift in the structure

according to the temperature of the water.

And so there's something about mammals and birds that they function very well

if they live at or above 37 degrees Celsius, about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Birds very often like a much, much higher temperature.

But every organism has a specific range where its enzymes work,

and the transition can be very sudden.

And there's a system that has just been more recently discovered

called the heat shock proteins.

And it happens that estrogen receptors are closely tied into the heat shock proteins.

And so what these proteins and estrogen are doing is trying to save the terribly stressed organism

that doesn't have the heat to keep working.

It does something to lock the structure up and protect it structurally.

And you can see that in the appearance and disappearance of microtubules

and the activity of various enzymes.

And anyway, that has been in the background of watching people when they take thyroid

or need thyroid or warm up their brains by taking progesterone

or eating more sugar and protein and so on.

And so the fact that the national temperature, especially in the last 50 years,

has dropped about a degree Fahrenheit for men and somewhat less for young women,

but for postmenopausal women their temperature has fallen about as much as men.

And so the fact that women, young women, have a higher body temperature than the average man

is an indicator of progesterone ruling their physiology enough to keep them working

and avoiding some of the aging diseases that men get as long as they steal or are cycling

and making progesterone.

And so in this newsletter I just go through all of the things that have been known

relating to inflammation, aging, degeneration, and disease

as it relates to failing to keep your temperature up where it should be.

Silly question, but the microtubules, is that the same thing as the cytoskeleton of the cell?

It's a big part of it.

It's the big hollow ones that are involved in cell division

and part of the system of movement.

But there are several types of smaller intermediate and smaller filaments.

Wasn't there a recent study showing that pregnenolone is one of the most effective stabilizers

of the structure of the microtubules and cholesterol as well?

Cholesterol, pregnenolone, and progesterone.

And we talked about it a while ago, Ray, the hardening and the suppleness of tissue or a cell

and that being a big part about aging and energy.

And unfortunately this was, I think it was an interview that never actually aired.

But it was really interesting talking about energy having a softening effect

and then the deprivation of energy having this hardening effect.

And that's of course associated with fibrosis and calcification, correct?

And cancer.

There are several articles that are very interesting.

For example, once you know that a tumor hardens, these people will say that, for example,

for telling whether breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes,

all you have to do is feel for the lymph nodes and see if they're abnormally hardened.

If they're not hardened, they're not cancerous.

And you see estrogen as one of the primary hardening aspects of aging and things like that.

That's driving the hardening.

- Anything that knocks the energy down.

- And it's kind of odd, like the carbon dioxide and the generation of heat have totally been sidelined

as the effects of proper mitochondrial respiration.

But people in the health world are so obsessed with mitochondria,

but those two things are rarely ever talked about.

Is that a little strange?

- Very strange.

That's part of what organizes my thinking, looking at the reason and the nature of the myths

that people have created to support their way of life and their belief system.

And mostly the giant corporations that run science and publication.

The ignoring temperature in my newsletter, I talk about the basis that goes back to the idea

that Raymond Pearl, a professor at Johns Hopkins, promoted that if you live fast and warm,

you'll use up all your heartbeats and burn all your permitted calories and have to die young.

And so he advocated being very lazy and staying cool to live a long time.

- Was he just stupid or was he supported by industry?

Like is there a specific outcome for the rate of living theory?

- He was immersed in the matrix of industry, so that was all part of it.

But I think he had to be really pretty stupid.

You put up a picture of a hummingbird right below his picture,

and you can see the difference in vitality and mentality between the two organisms.

- His experiment was on seeds or something?

It sounds, I mean, to me, a layman, it sounds really stupid.

It just sounds really ridiculous of what his experiment was.

- Once you get used to it, that's not at all unusual.

For example, someone was just asking me about the telomere theory of aging

and the idea that we have an inborn number of cell divisions,

which really derives straight from Pearl's idea that we have only so many heartbeats

or so many calories that we can produce in a lifespan.

For Hayflick, it was so many cell divisions that were allotted.

And the first group of his papers that I read was in 1970.

And I had to show them around to my friends

because I couldn't believe that anyone could really say such stupid things.

And his whole career, if you see it in terms of, for example,

one paper, he kept one group of cells frozen in liquid nitrogen,

very cold for a year or two, and another he kept in the lab in the usual dish.

And his conclusion was that being frozen at minus 70 degrees Celsius or whatever it was,

cells don't age.

- Well, sure.

- Your orientation was shaped before this by Albert St. Georgi.

So you were kind of reading the good stuff,

and that's why these ideas seem so ridiculous to you when you were confronted with them?

- Oh, yeah.

But I had started reading the encyclopedias,

which even the little Funk and Wagnalls had very good objective articles in it.

And then we got the 1950 Britannica, and some of its articles are still the best on the subject available.

The newer 1960s editions have gone somewhat stupid compared to the classics.

From 1900 to the 1950s, the Britannica was a great source of orientation in science and culture.

- Yes, Albert, I'm sorry, Albert St. Georgi was much later.

Was there a counter, was Lamarck like the counter to this kind of rate of living theory,

or you're talking about the Britannica?

Was there an idea that was suppressed in favor of the rate of living theory?

- Yeah, it grew most directly out of August Weissman's wear and tear theory.

The rate of living is just another version of Weissman's wear and tear.

And the free radicals, Denham-Harman's theory of free radical aging, damage to the mitochondria,

that's just more wear and tear theory.

And part of the essence of Weissman's ideology was to destroy Lamarck and actual Darwinism

to support the essentially idealistic, anti-evolutionary position of the, what's the first geneticist?

The monk Mendel, Gregor Mendel.

His position was simply derived from Catholic doctrine, that nothing essential changes.

Genes are immortal, and so the apparent changes that you see that are mistaken for evolution

are just mixing immortal genes.

For Weissman, the germline is immortal, and the body, the soma, is mortal.

So Weissman was just rephrasing the Christian doctrine of Mendel.

And so those were getting built into the authoritarian side of the medical and biological cultures.

Meanwhile, there was the actual science going along at ground level with people like Jacques Loeb

and Alexis Carroll, Otto Warburg and St. Georgi and so on.

Okay, so Otto Warburg, they would have been like the pro, they would have been the vitalists

or the animists compared to the 1928 Raymond Pearl types.

I'm trying to say, who were the pro-metabolic people in the '30s?

Well, Warburg, obviously, and Frederick Koch.

Frederick Koch inspired at least St. Georgi, and I don't think Warburg ever said anything about Koch,

but his ideas were really kind of vitalistic or holistic, because he said the whole organism

is the immune system, that the vitality of the whole thing isn't separable.

And that's what the mainline embryologists were seeing, that you can take part of an early embryo

and isolate it, and it will produce a whole organism.

So it's not an assemblage of parts.

The ovum has an intention, and if you cut the dividing parts of the ovum into several pieces,

each one can still fulfill its intention of becoming a whole organism.

And that idea continued into field theories of all sorts in the '20s and '30s,

and people recognizing Warburg's work, for example, saw that if you look at an area that's developing a cancer,

you can find at the center a perfect malignant bunch of cells, but surrounding that,

the next adrening ring of cells will be pre-malignant, very degenerated, but not decisively cancerous,

and revertible if you change their embryological position or their place in the organism.

And surrounding that is less and less inflamed cells.

So in the '30s, there was lots of evidence showing that cancer is a field process

under some degree of control of the surrounding organism.

And in psychology, Gestalt psychology was extending that whole thing,

thinking of the brain as similar to the organism, working in terms of holes,

not wires and digital computable units, but as holes and images.

That whole thing, the Second World War distracted from it,

but there was a very deliberate killing off of it with several, both government and industry,

trends to sell the idea that we are mechanisms,

and to totally knock out of science history all of this holistic embryological field understanding of nature and the organism.

Have you had any discussion with people in regards to the telomere theory,

proponents of the theory, and have you asked their opinion on how is it that if the rate of living is so important,

if telomere length is so important, how come every attempt to inhibit telomerase seems to lead to cancer?

There have been at least five or six companies.

The enzyme telomerase, every time a company tries to come up with a drug to inhibit that enzyme

to preserve the length on telomeres, that seems to invariably cause cancer in pretty much every animal model that they've tried.

I think it's just one of the organizing things that has to be whole to get a whole functioning organism.

You can produce cancer in about a million different ways. I think that's just one of them.

Right. What I'm trying to get at is that it seems that trying to manipulate the telomere length,

or at least artificially keep it long, which is kind of like the corollary of that rate of living or the long telomere thing,

every time they come up with a drug that tries to keep the telomeres artificially long,

they seem to be endangering some kind of a cancerous process.

Or at least all of the drugs that they've developed so far, that seems to be the end result so far.

They've been cancerous in the animal models that they've tried.

I went through the arguments. It's been about 15 or 20 years, I think.

But at that time, there was accumulating very clear evidence that some very old 90- or 100-year-old individuals had long telomeres,

and some young people in their 20s and 30s had extremely short, worn-out-looking telomeres.

I think the correlation of it strictly with aging has been a biased sampling to fit the ideology.

How do you think Richard Dawkins' ideas of the selfish gene grow out of Weissman's?

Was he part of that group? I mean, he's not that old, but he seems to be sort of like the protege of Weissman,

just living in modern times. He seems to be spitting out the same kind of nonsense.

I think it's some kind of growing-up family personality development that happens.

Do you think maternal stress or having some sort of rough childhood leads people to develop such a twisted view of nature?

He seems to be coming from a fairly well-off family, or at least a non-poor one.

Oh, yeah. They identify with the interests of the royalty and ruling classes.

The ideology is classical, ancient doctrine that the divine right of kings is something built into the universe.

For example, meritocracy derives from the idea of an unchanging, un-evolving social order.

Naturally, you can't have monkeys turning into people.

If you're going to have divine kings, everything arranged in a heavenly order,

a great chain of being from angels to kings, all the way down to ordinary people and monkeys near the bottom.

It's so deeply into our culture. Most professors don't want to acknowledge that that's where our history has come from.

Bertrand Russell seems to have some of those views of doctrines, but I felt like by reading his works that he eventually realized that the ruling class is just trying to enslave everybody.

And while he still wrote and did work in service of them, I think every once in a while he spoke the truth.

Do you have a similar impression of him?

Oh, absolutely. He was as high in the ruling class as you can be in England without being royal.

And so he grew up with that perfect, concrete view of logic and mentality.

He wanted to show that our divine mentality and clear logic is identical with mathematics.

And then in middle age, he actually started thinking about it and said, well, we really don't know whether Leibniz might have been right,

that everything is defined partly by where it is and what it's with.

And if everything is part of one's being is where one is, then everything is constantly changing its essence.

And so how can you have language and a perfect mathematical language if reality is actually context sensitive?

If it makes a difference to the Earth, that the moon and the sun and Saturn and Mars are moving around in space,

could it affect the essence of the Earth that other things are related to it in space and time?

And Russell just had that simple insight.

How can you define things in isolation? Where do we have the evidence that there are timeless entities, which atoms are believed to be?

And at first he was calling the units of his thinking logical atoms.

But as he thought more about the Leibnizian possibilities of metaphysics and ontology,

he realized that there is no evidence basis for having these abstract atomic views of logic.

So simply his ability being very intelligent, he was able to learn and actually think his way out of it.

It sounds like maybe he was a radical empiricist later in life.

Yeah, pretty much. He didn't talk about it because there was no place to talk effectively.

I think the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein also had a big impression on him because he was one of his students.

And Wittgenstein then asked Bertrand Russell to write the foreword to his magnum opus,

Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, as it was called.

And Bertrand Russell wrote it and Wittgenstein absolutely hated it and said, "You think like a computer.

This is not what this book is all about." And he had a falling out.

And I think that's one of the things that Russell was devastated because he thought Wittgenstein was brilliant.

And if this brilliant mind thinks that I'm dumb as a bag of rocks and I just don't get what logic and philosophy and life are all about,

that I must change my…

He said that that was the event that made him turn to politics and social moral philosophy.

He realized he wasn't smart enough, but he actually was intelligent enough to change his mind.

I wanted to ask a question about carbon dioxide and temperature.

I saw several studies performed in the '70s that were done in the United States,

and they were giving people either vitamin B1 or acetylzolamide or the two together and also warming people up.

And they were able to permanently cure severe psychiatric diseases that are nowadays still considered incurable.

How is it possible that human trials like this could occur in the '70s and this knowledge is out there, widely available,

and these things cannot seem to be possible to happen now? You just cannot get funding.

If you try to convince a funding body to give you money for vitamin B1 or acetylzolamide,

I'm pretty sure they will laugh you out of the room.

What was different back then? I mean, it was still a fairly authoritarian time, wasn't it?

Yeah, and before that, some psychiatrists put some patients in the house with continuously elevated carbon dioxide,

and all of their psychopathic conditions improved.

And what that elevated CO2 does is to increase your metabolic rate and body temperature.

So there have been lots of workable therapies, but no one sells those things.

You can't make a trillion dollars selling thiamine or carbon dioxide.

But they were still done in the '70s, right? And it was fairly large in terms of how many people were involved.

Those things seem to have completely died out and disappeared.

So is this basically due to the fact that the pharma industry really took full control of academia over the last two, three decades?

Oh, yeah. It's a continuing process. They're trying to finish it off now.

They're trying to even get the nuisance students and professors out of the universities and turn it over to a few, one or two corporations who will prepare the courses and sell the licenses to the students.

Doesn't this new model also completely, well, not completely, but move us further away from experimentation towards abstract thinking?

I mean, how would experiments be performed if all the universities are closed?

Well, experiments have mostly been a nuisance to the business of science.

You know, the journals just won't publish things that are anomalous seeming observations.

You know the fate of Halton Arp and his pictures of galaxies.

They wouldn't let him use their telescope anymore because he saw things he shouldn't have.

I have a few friends that have chemical degrees, graduate degrees in chemistry, and little by little chemistry seems to move entirely towards the so-called in silico modeling.

Basically, they're just using computer models to design new molecules and predict the effects of those molecules in organisms.

So I'm guessing that has some sort of a validity, but it seems that chemistry is moving towards trying to replace almost entirely the process of experimentation with modeling in a computer.

Yeah, it will rarely cause embarrassment for anyone.

The computers aren't going to invent anything shockingly unexpected, but experiments actually are constantly doing that.

Right, just for posterity, can we talk about the living fast, dying when, and the temperature in ROS and aging in general?

This is something I'll be perusing Twitter and I'll still see people talking about increasing the metabolism increases the reactive oxygen species, and so maybe just unpacking that a little bit.

The ability to detoxify the free radicals increases when your metabolic rate is higher.

Slowing your metabolic rate, you shift towards the reductive, anti-oxidative state, and you grossly slow down your ability to inactivate the free radicals that are produced.

And then, just a slightly related topic, but calorie, reducing calorie, calorie deficit models, am I saying that right?

You pointed out in your Gender of Energy book that that could be from a multitude of different things, from PUFA restriction to heavy metal restriction.

People online commonly talk about longevity and aging like they're the same thing, but they're not really the same, right?

No, you can avoid the main things that kill old people and you can extend lifespan up to 90 or 100 or so, and that's what the genetic determinists emphasize.

They say that the process is essentially mechanical and it's all foreordained whether by some Hayflick principle or the necessary accumulation of free radical damage.

But the experiments that show that the more saturated fat animals live at a higher temperature without damage and live much longer than animals of a similar weight with highly unsaturated membranes.

So the hotter you are, the more you revise your fats away from unsaturation.

If you just grow soybeans, for example, in a hot, humid climate or in a northern climate where they usually grow them, they'll have more saturated fats when they grow in the more humid and warm climate.

And if you have a pig in the north eating the usual corn and beans diet, it's going to have very unsaturated fat in the layer under it, close to its skin, because the skin is constantly living at a lower temperature.

But if you put a sweater on the pig so its skin doesn't get so chilled on the same diet, its subcutaneous fat will be much more saturated.

So we adjust to keep the hot tissues from getting over-unsaturated and the breakdown largely in the mitochondria of polyunsaturated fats turns down the oxidation energy production

and lets only the random kind of oxidative damage occur.

Aren't the polyunsaturated fats, in contrast to the saturated ones, aren't the PUFAs also deactivating the uncoupling enzymes, the ones that raise temperature?

Yeah, in general, the life-extending things do increase the uncoupling activity.

I've also seen several studies showing that lower temperature increases the activity of the enzyme aromatase. Have you seen anything in regards to that effect?

Yeah, a Russian experimenter noticed that the temperature connection of both testicles and ovaries live considerably cooler than the core temperature of the body.

And that's surprising in the case of ovaries because they're in the core of the body, but they have some kind of a cooling system that keeps their temperature lower.

And so he chopped up bits of ovaries and implanted them under the ear skin of rabbits.

Their long ears in a cool climate are several degrees cooler than the rest of the body.

And he found that they went into constant estrus and they had the ovaries living at that very low temperature.

So they were overproducing estrogen, basically?

Yeah.

What do you think is the adaptive function of the chronic inflammation that seems to be happening under constant exposure to low temperature?

Is it like a desperate attempt to raise temperature because the inflammation usually triggers some kind of a fever?

I don't think I understand why it happens.

The proper response to injury doesn't involve inflammation, and so I think those are being used in a way that they weren't intended by the organism to be used.

I think they function in a healthy environment, in a complete well-nourished environment with the right oxygen tension and so on.

I think they function as regulators and don't really turn on that anti-biological kind of inflammation.

So if a person's or if an organism's stores of fat were, let's say, 100% saturated, when they're exposed to cold, there wouldn't necessarily be an inflammatory response.

That fat will flood the bloodstream, but if saturated fats have an uncoupling effect, then basically that would serve the purpose of raising temperature, but in a positive manner,

versus the PUFAs, when they flood the bloodstream when it's cold due to increased lipolysis, they will simply serve as a precursor to the inflammatory mediator.

So it will still raise temperature, but in a very pathological and disadaptive way.

Yeah, I think that's part of why injured fetuses inside the womb don't heal by forming a scar.

They heal perfectly, just like a fragment of an embryo can complete itself.

A damaged part of a fetus can regenerate itself without forming a scar.

I think that's because of the high temperature, steady temperature, and carbon dioxide and glucose meeting the needs, so that those very same peptides and such that cause inflammation in the worst situation are constructive, reparative, rather than causing the damage of inflammation.

In terms of reactive oxygen species, do they have any positive function?

I was under the impression that some of them participate in the oxidative destruction of things like serotonin.

So it's good to have at least some level of those, right?

Some level of which?

Of reactive oxygen species.

Oh, locally produced, yeah. The amino oxidase, I think that's the enzyme in the lungs and a few other places that destroys serotonin.

Right. So, but I guess the medical industry, when they say reactive oxygen species, from what I understand is they tend to accumulate or form when there's actually a blockage of metabolism.

There was a recent study which showed that administering chemicals that block any of the electron transport chain complexes drastically increased the production of reactive oxygen species.

So it's low metabolism that causes ROS, not high.

Right. You mentioned Broda Barnes in your newsletter, and I feel like I send people quotes from Hypothyroidism, the unsuspecting illness, like multiple times per day.

When did you learn about him? And then was that the reason, was he kind of the inspiration for the first time you yourself took thyroid?

His books came out, I think, early 1970s.

And I didn't connect him specifically. I had been thinking about it for years, but since I had a much above normal metabolic rate, I had to learn other things before I was willing to experiment with thyroid.

Because I was, for example, on a BMR machine where you breathe oxygen while lying at rest. The machine is set up so that you're supposed to, in the couple of minutes during the test, you're expected to breathe somewhere between a third and two-thirds of the can that contains the oxygen that you're measuring.

And during the time of the test, before the test was over, I had used up the oxygen.

So it was looked from the slope of the line like it was about three times the normal rate.

And I was aware of that for just about nine or ten years before I finally convinced myself to try taking thyroid.

And when I did, within a few days, my rate of metabolism had come down to approximately normal.

You've mentioned this a few times. It's always been slightly confusing to me.

Do you think your high natural, high rate of metabolism was from stress and taking the thyroid lowered it?

Since then, I've known a few men in their 20s to early 40s with a similar thing. They would weigh maybe 140 pounds and be 5'8" or 10" or so.

And no matter how much they ate, they couldn't gain any weight.

And from my own experience, I suggested they try thyroid, and every one of them immediately started building muscle and growing.

My interpretation was, after I read Jerry Ikawa's book on magnesium, he had some information in it about the mechanism by which the body retains magnesium.

And it's held inside the cells largely as a complex with ATP. Magnesium ATP is in effect a compound.

And when you have more ADP, the de-energized form, that associates with calcium.

And so as your energy level goes down, your cells pick up calcium and lose magnesium.

And if you lose magnesium, you get cramping and inability to relax fully.

And so the cell sits there spending energy just making ATP so that it can hang on to magnesium, which tends to get lost.

And supplementing magnesium to a hypothyroid person will typically relieve their symptoms for a very short time, maybe just a few hours.

And if you measure it, the amount you put in and the amount that comes out in your urine a few hours later, they've lost all of the magnesium you put in them.

If you give them quick acting T3 and magnesium and then check their urine at the same time later, they haven't lost their magnesium.

It's just like a switch letting your cells retain the magnesium.

Just for my own interest, when you first took thyroid, you said it lowered your basal metabolic rate.

But did that also accompanied by a resolution of maybe some type of symptoms that you noticed as well or no?

Oh, yeah. When I lectured someone, I asked why I wasn't fidgeting the way I always did before.

And I slept much more easily without being wakened by any little environmental noise.

I was going into a deeper sleep. So those were very sudden changes that went with the metabolic rate.

So in terms of the measure of the metabolic rate, that machine measures the metabolic rate, but it doesn't measure your rate of carbon dioxide production.

So in order to find out if your basal metabolic rate is high and also in a good way, you also have to measure how much carbon dioxide you expire, right?

That's what matters, the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of oxygen consumed.

It should be very close to the same.

Right. And if somebody has a very high rate of oxygen consumption but low rate of carbon dioxide production, that means they're running on the stress metabolism.

They're getting ransomed quickly.

Okay. So that's basically adrenaline and cortisol driving their metabolic rate.

Maybe we could touch on PUFA and hibernation. Ray, are you familiar with Chris Knob? He seems to have read your articles.

He's talking about cardiolipin and cytochrome C oxidase.

So I don't know if you've communicated with him at all, but he seems to be saying a lot of the things you've been saying for a very long time.

What's the last name?

Knob, K-N-O-B-B-E. He has a video on YouTube called the PUFA Apocalypse, I think.

Nope, I haven't heard of him.

I think he's familiar with your work.

But anyways, just the general, you know, your biological view of PUFA and hibernation.

And you had quoted articles in your newest newsletter, but also the ones that I had read a few of them by Geiser, first name F.

And again, I'm always astounded when I read these articles and they just perfectly align with what you're talking about.

Yeah, they've known that for a long time, that animals eat unsaturated fats in the fall when the nuts are ready.

And their bodies become much more polyunsaturated and then they go to sleep or don't really go to sleep.

They go into a torpor.

And the typical hibernator who gets very torpid and cold, they usually have to wake up two or three times from the torpor to go to sleep.

Because they actually need real sleep for brain maintenance and repair.

And when we go into hibernation, we just get a cold brain and get sick when we go into our pseudo hibernation phase.

Yeah, the deep sleep needs a good warm temperature, right up 98 plus something to sleep into the deep sleep.

That's all I had about the news.

Georgie, any other questions before we go into conspiracy stuff?

I think there were a few studies recently done that show that hibernating animals refuse to eat nuts and the seeds if they're given during the hot months in the spring and the summer.

So this whole premise that, "Oh, look at all these animals that are thriving on nuts and seeds that are filled with PUFA."

No, they actually seem to be eating them at very specific times of year.

They refuse to eat them when they're actually fully active and running around and mating.

They only eat them when they're about to go into torpor.

They're very sensible.

Okay. I shouldn't even call it conspiracy. It's just the news because it's so in your face with what's going on.

Ray, are you surprised at the lack of coordination between the messaging behind the vaccine?

It seems so incoherent that I know people that, again, aren't into these alternative theories or trying to figure out what's going on, that they're confused by what's happening.

Like, you still need to wear a mask if you get a vaccine.

It doesn't protect you from the virus, they say.

It doesn't seem like they're coordinated with what they're talking about.

Yeah. This is someone who's assuming that there is something sensible going on.

Yeah. Yes.

If you pay close attention to the experts, especially the government-connected experts, I haven't seen anyone who is either both informed and honest.

A lot of them, I think, are both ignorant and not caring about the honesty of it.

Did you see the...

Everything they talk about, like describing COVID as a new, uniquely bad disease, I've heard probably 15 or 20 people who are supposedly experts say that they named the various features.

But everything they say is unique about it was an outstanding feature of influenza, and supposedly they're respiratory experts.

So how can they say that because something has exactly the same side effects that influenza had, that it's some uniquely new and bad condition?

Everything you look at, they wouldn't be embarrassing themselves if they had the sense.

Because this is so sloppy, is there any way to entertain the idea that, again, people are seeing people having allergies and all these bad reactions to the vaccine?

Do you think it's being rushed so quickly that it's possible that it scares an even larger portion of the people that, even if that did happen, it'd just be a little bump in the road and they're still going to push forward with their agenda no matter what?

We should hope that it's going to scare a lot of people.

Did you read the Pfizer publication that came out, I think, Monday?

Maybe.

New England Journal of Medicine, the chief editor, who is not a virologist, wrote an editorial to go with Pfizer's statement.

And he not only wrote the editorial saying what a triumph this information is, but he was on the FDA committee that voted for it.

And his magazine gets huge amounts of advertising from Pfizer.

So it's all an inside deal.

And if you go through what Pfizer actually said, they didn't say a peep about the nature of the population and who was excluded from the tests.

But when two English nurses on the first day developed anaphylaxis, after that happened, someone asked them, ask Pfizer, and they said, well, allergy was one of the groups that was excluded from testing.

So now they tell us.

And they also excluded old people, apparently.

But the first people who are going to get the actual vaccine are said to be the people in long-term care homes, the frail and old,

exactly the people that vaccines usually don't work very well with, but who might be most susceptible to dying very soon from getting any inflammation that it produces.

And the editor in chief, Eric Rubin, who said it was a triumph on a radio interview, he said he was glad that his young, healthy patients weren't in line to receive the virus now,

the vaccine now for a few months, so that they would be able to see what its effects are on frail old people.

Laughing because it's crazy.

It's hard to imagine anyone who could say that, but I think you can find it on the Internet.

The guy who was praising it, saying that better for his healthy people not to risk it.

Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, says don't be surprised when older people are dying within a day or two of their vaccination,

who are residents in long-term care facilities.

And this Reddit commenter was saying they've been saying for months that if you go outside without a mask, you're the devil, but they're going to be killing people in old folks' homes.

And that's just part of the vaccination.

It doesn't make any sense.

When it came out that they had excluded allergic people from the test for their safety, an official at the FDA said there are 1.6 million allergic people in the United States who might suffer anaphylaxis from a vaccination.

1.6 million is a lot of people. We can't afford not to vaccinate that large number of people.

So naturally, they will be required to risk anaphylaxis.

So, I mean, there was also the issue of like the trial design.

They use the PCR test to assign, to basically determine that the trial participants have not had COVID in the past.

But if you look at the PCR test, it has a notoriously high false negative rate, at best 20%, and sometimes as bad as 100%.

So there is no guarantee that these people that were already in the, you know, that they were admitted to the trial, that they weren't already having like, that they didn't already have the COVID and had antibodies and natural immunity.

So Pfizer could have easily designed the group, the one that looked better to be the ones that already had it, right?

The ones that already have an immunity.

And also, I think they didn't control for any prior vaccinations.

And I think you mentioned in several interviews that having the influenza vaccine increased your chance of getting COVID.

So that wasn't controlled for either.

So it was a very poorly designed trial to start with.

So I'm surprised they're able to draw any statistically significant conclusions whatsoever.

Yeah, I think it was someone at Pfizer that said that, well, the experimental period goes on for two years.

So we won't know how safe it is for until the end of the two years.

But they also, I think the actual trial stopped following people up after the second month, right?

Or something like that.

And they declared it safe if nothing happened within the first two months of receiving the last dose.

Yeah, but even ordinary traditional vaccines, supposedly they had to be followed up for up to two years.

And now with this nucleic acid content of the vaccine, logically you would think maybe they should follow them up for two or three generations.

Doesn't the emergency use authorization basically say that all the FDA is saying is not that this is safe, not that this is effective,

but it leaves it as a decision between a doctor and a patient, and FDA saying this basically passes just some very basic criteria of what a drug should be.

But the ultimate result is not a recommendation.

It's leaving it to the patient and the doctor to decide.

But that's not what we're hearing on TV.

Yeah, the insiders somewhat sensibly to each other about actual dangers,

but the very same person talking on television tells a totally different story.

So clearly they're crooks and careless about the public health.

Are there any publications demonstrating incorporation of mRNA material into our DNA after, let's say, injecting it?

It doesn't have to be a vaccine, but any sort of trial that injected foreign RNA and found it incorporated into the DNA of the organism?

Yeah, for years there's been a lab in Germany, Walter Dorfler,

who has been demonstrating the incorporation of foreign DNA just from regular exposures.

But now we have the intramuscular injection, which is a much easier way to get it in.

It's expecting the cells to take it up.

And once it's in the cell, we have the reverse transcriptase enzymes.

I just saw a recent publication validating the fact that we do have the reverse transcriptase enzymes that can turn viral RNA into DNA,

which can then be integrated into our genome.

I was going to ask you about fertility and syn... how do you say it, George? Syn...

Syncytin.

Syncytin.

But that just reminded me of something you had said previously, that we're being prepared to activate our renin-aldosterone, angiotensin-aldosterone system,

and that's the opposite of progesterone.

So just on that fact alone, this would be an anti-fertility vaccine.

Does that make sense?

There's one personality of, I think it's the spike protein and the syncytial protein or enzyme that forms the placenta.

They're structurally very similar.

And until that's disposed of, I don't know why anyone shouldn't just stop until they do some actual experiments and see whether it's so or not.

But yeah, and I don't want you to speculate or anything, but that could be the reason this vaccine, this could be on purpose.

That's a possibility, right?

Oh, yeah. When you see the horrible things they do openly and have their face on the camera saying it, then if they can do such horrible things as that,

then I don't know why you should suppose they wouldn't do the ordinary conspiratorial kind of anti-human activities.

You said several times that when we're exposed to chronic stress, then all of this retroviral material that's in our genome starts to shed into the bloodstream.

And this seems to be driven by inflammation as well.

And since this vaccine has this highly pro-inflammatory protein, do you think there's a risk of us causing something similar, sort of like an AIDS-type syndrome appearing?

Yeah, just from dumping lots of new, unfamiliar stuff.

The more of it that comes out at once, the more confusion it can cause in your metabolism and immune reactions.

Outside of the COVID-19 vaccine, are there any other mRNA vaccines you're aware of that are in widespread use?

That are what?

That are in widespread use, aside from this one?

No, the only nucleic acid intentionally included was this one.

But things like the Simian virus 40 tumor producer, they knew it was there when all of the world-famous vaccine people were talking.

And one of them said, "Oh, well, good. The Russians are using it now. Maybe it'll get rid of some Russians."

Wow. So if the SV40 is producing, the vaccines containing SV40 are tumorigenic, why wouldn't this be as well?

That other one was fairly quickly tested in animals and shown to be.

No one is testing this stuff in that way.

It would take a little bit of honest curiosity before they would bother testing it.

But there seems to be a similar potential, right?

So we talked about it last week, but there's an emergency authorization act for first-line workers and things like that, and older people.

But when do you think the, what did you say, proverbial crap hits the fans, Georgie, last time?

That's going to happen in April when they do this mass vaccination campaign.

It seems, again, so sloppy right now. But when do you think, again, I don't speculate if you don't want to, but what do you think?

They'll tighten things up and just normal people will start getting this vaccine.

What do you think is going to happen then, Ray?

I'm hoping that there will be a big reaction against it.

We were talking yesterday that putting the nurses and doctors in the front line, even ahead of the long-term care patients as expendables,

remembering what Eric Schmidt and Klaus Schwab have been predicting, we aren't going to need doctors or teachers anymore.

So they're good experimental material for a first run of the virus, because we're going to have digital medicine along with digital education.

So it really doesn't matter to them if they lose lots of doctors.

And especially it's going to save money for the insurance companies if they lose about half of the old people in the retirement homes.

It should really start waves of thinking and reaction and criticism going through the general population.

Do you think Schmidt and Klaus have an army of doctor robots and teacher robots ready to take over?

I mean, Schmidt's attempts to apply AI to the medical field and IBM's most notably failed miserably.

So their diagnostic AI system, I think it was Watson they called it, right?

They applied it to medicine. It flopped.

I mean, even the mainstream press was grilled pretty hard and said that AI is nowhere near what we've been told it is.

So I can't even begin to imagine how much more difficult the teaching process would be to emulate in a machine.

So they're saying doctors and teachers are expendable, but do they even have anything right now ready to replace them?

Or is this just like projections and conjectures?

I think they are hoping to have continuing crisis.

And if there's a die off of doctors and nurses, that's in itself a self-supporting crisis.

You hardly need a pandemic if you have lots of doctors becoming rheumatic, autoimmune diseases, disabled in various ways.

That becomes another major crisis for them to work on over the next couple of years.

So if you cause a shortage in these professions, then people will be willing to accept any alternative and Schmidt will conveniently say,

"Oh, here is this doctor robot which you can try in the meantime until we replenish the ranks."

In a crisis, they will approve any kind of remote control surgery machine or remote control computer doctoring machine.

And of course receive full immunity, right? Just as Pfizer did for the vaccine in the UK. Full immunity no matter what happens.

That's so twisted, especially since these people, most of them will be advocating for their own death.

So it's only from the mind of an oligarch, I guess. Yeah, that's insane.

Okay, anything else? I feel like there's a historical episode because this stuff is all happening.

Ray, can you even think about in your history on this planet of anything as crazy as this happening? Does this top the list?

Yeah, I think it does.

So even World War II and the propaganda associated with it doesn't cut it, doesn't take first place compared to that?

No, the Korean War was really a highlight of how they could be committing genocide, destroying more of a single country than they've ever destroyed before.

Practicing germ biological warfare and using the bomb dropping.

They bombed every city until there was nothing and even Douglas MacArthur vomited when he saw what they had done to the country.

Americans at home didn't know anything was going on.

When do you think the powers that be realized that crisis serves them very well and they started actively, purposefully working and probably even setting up teams that come up with future crisis?

Was that around the Korean War or the Vietnam War?

I think they were just going back 10 years. The Rockefeller Foundation had people working on it, but I imagine organized efforts were in the various foundations long before that.

Do you know anything about the Phoenix program in Vietnam? The author Douglas Valentine makes the case that a lot of what happened after 9/11 was directly from what the CIA learned during the Phoenix program of documenting all the people they had killed and tortured and things.

The Indonesia episode, American social science, people like the Obamas were helping it along doing social research to help to form lists of the million people they needed to exterminate and dump into the rivers.

That sort of thing has been both academic and governmental in a very organized form using anthropologists and sociologists and various kinds of cultural researchers to help to organize assassination campaigns on an industrial scale.

Most Americans would have never guessed that it was going to be eventually turned on them though like we're experiencing now.

Oh no, oh no.

Okay, unless, George, you have other questions. I have like a list of questions I've been wanting to ask you for multiple streams, but George, if you have some, go for it.

Are you familiar with the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski?

Yeah, yeah.

Have you read his Unabomber manifesto or at least the ideas there?

I kind of liked it. Nice environmental sentiment.

Right. He seemed to be pretty worried and condemned technocracy, at least from what I understand from it. Do you think he got that sort of ideas while he was tortured at Harvard under the MKUltra experiment or do you think he had more inside knowledge?

No, I don't know anything on the inside of that.

Okay. But it seems that for a person who was, you know, all it took for him to be, I guess, subjected to these psychological torture experiments and he developed a very strong hatred for the technocratic process.

And that's, you know, he wrote that Unabomber manifesto. And, you know, if you read it, it's basically, it's an indictment of the system that is currently controlling us.

And I'm surprised he hasn't seen more publicity. I remember when I first came to the United States in '97, a few major newspapers published it and he was universally condemned by everybody.

Despite some people trying to say, look, this guy has some good ideas. We're not headed in a good direction. But it was only a few voices in general. It was universally condemned.

Yeah, it was too bad he had the publicity that he did because anyone looking at the inside of things should come up with conclusions like that, that technology is a dead end as it's going.

Norbert Wiener was warning of that in the early '50s. And so he refused grants related to mass murder. And so he was ridiculed at MIT for not accepting the war culture.

But his human use of human beings was a very interesting book. And he saw it as deep as the divide between digital control and analog control.

You're much less likely to go off into insane futures if you are thinking in terms of analogs and making everything immediately apparent to how you regulate it and what it's going to do, where the whole process becomes invisible when it's digital.

Right. So basically the analog computation is a physical process. It's analogous to the human brain, while digital is arbitrary and it's just somebody's crazy definition.

Yeah, you can't possibly have any moral judgments in the digital world. And that was Norbert Wiener's whole thing that people might consider acting like human beings.

Do you think there's an optimal level of technological development that helps civilization beyond which it starts to become detrimental? If yes, is there a way to gauge it/measure it? Or does it always change and it needs to be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis?

Somewhere very close to the middle of the 20th century, we had everything a person could conceivably need and we could have gone on researching and developing things safely from that point.

It was the computer world and the CIA getting together around 1940s and 50s that put it on the death path.

So it's not a coincidence that they say the world peaked in the mid-20th century?

Yeah, there was still the field approach to looking at organisms. And Norbert Wiener and a couple of others in the government still, who had the analog view, the real world view of how we should understand things.

But they were just deliberately covered up, quieted.

Are you guys still there?

Yeah, you there? I was going to ask you, speaking of digital, what is your take on Bitcoin? People ask me that fairly often.

I don't really know what it is. People have often offered to give me some, but I wouldn't know what to do with it.

It's what the Federal Reserve will turn our regular money into in the near future.

Yeah, I know something bad like that will happen, but I don't care to understand it.

And then we talked about it maybe a little bit last time, but Klaus Schwab saying there's going to be a giant cyber attack and then it will bring down power and internet and things like that.

That seems like a pretty convenient way to immediately censor everyone.

Like instead of censoring people on Twitter or Facebook individually, if they really need to do something big, that seems like sending everybody back to the Stone Age would really fit the bill.

And obviously I believe Klaus, he apparently knows that there's going to be a big cyber attack coming up.

Yeah, that's pretty much on schedule, I think.

But if the power is off, how are they going to brainwash the populace, right? They still need to be able to broadcast their poison.

Oh yeah, I think they'll just wipe out the things that they don't want and bring it back up purified.

So do you think, George, you and I were talking about this before we went live, but they're rolling out the vaccine stuff now.

And so it would be maybe, I'm not a crazy, insane oligarch, but it would be maybe weird to shut everything down in the middle of that.

So maybe that's a year away or two years away or three years away, maybe in the next 10 years or so.

Oh, no. Anytime things need to be shaken up, I think they have a repertoire of tricks they can pull out in an opportune way.

So in terms of money, if all fiat currency, actually fiat or not, if all currency derives its value from the people,

and if the elite is basically waging wars against humanity and trying to kill as many people as they want, basically,

isn't that undermining their own wealth in a certain way?

I mean, the wealth starts to become an arbitrary definition, just like a computer program.

They get to assign it whatever wealth number they want, but that doesn't mean it's going to have any value, right?

I mean, China can tomorrow say, "We don't want your US dollars because they have no real value.

You've been telling us they have so much value, but they don't."

It's whatever we decide the US dollar has value, and we don't care about your definition.

Doesn't that whole process of waging war against humanity undermine even the interests of the elite in a sense?

I think they figure that they're going to integrate China, and everyone get them just as thoroughly controlled as the American population.

And the behavior, once it's under control, then they can figure out how to make it do exactly what they want over the long run.

So in a strange way, China is like an obstacle in their course, and we should be grateful that it's still there?

I think so. It's really probably the main obstacle to everything being finished off in just a matter of months.

China has the vitality of lots and lots of intelligent, well-educated people developing economic power.

So I don't think it's going to be very easy to eliminate them from their program.

Do you think Russia has already been subjugated, or they're still trying to put up a fight?

As long as Putin is in, I think they have such a literate population that that will give them momentum for a couple generations.

Just people who read, who really think about politics rather than just consuming it.

So you're saying it's not necessarily natural resources, it's how awake or at least how willing to perceive the population of a country.

That's really the main obstacle to the empire?

I think so. They can end up poisoning masses, but short of that, the consciousness of the population is going to endlessly resourcefulness.

I think we'll keep coming out in places they don't want to. Like Iran is getting out fronted the worst of the sanctions.

So now they're giving the US ultimatums. They have to restore the nuclear agreement within 60 days.

So basically you're saying that there are several countries getting back on their feet and saying, "We're not done yet."

Once a country gets it into their mind that they want to be outside of the empire, I think it's going to be very hard to keep going ahead with the Great Reset.

So the more countries break out of the empire to establish world control.

Several years ago, somebody asked you if you had to leave the United States, what country would you go to?

I think you said something along the lines of the western parts of Latin America are the places where civilization has its best chance to escape or to survive.

But you never mentioned countries like Russia or Iran or even other countries.

Is there a reason why you think western parts of Latin America somehow have more chance of preserving freedom and civilization?

In Russia, it's the weather and the scenery.

You don't like them?

Yeah, flat land and long winters.

And along the western edge of the country, you have the clean air coming off the Pacific combined with sunny days and high altitude.

You have a very ideal region.

So the Andes Mountains basically, countries that span the Andes.

Okay, Ray, I'm just going to run through some things.

So feel free to talk as long or as little about any of this.

Copper is very... people are talking about copper a lot these days.

And I know that you've done a lot of work on that subject in your "Gener of Energy" book.

You said, "I think chronic loss of copper accounts for the obvious features of aging..."

And I know you've said in your articles, probably on interviews as well, that thyroid was needed to absorb copper.

And then apparently, and correct me if I'm wrong, DHEA has a relationship with copper.

And obviously thyroid.

Is there any way to weave a narrative through any of that?

No, not right now anyway.

There's a book by, I think, A.E. Needham, not the famous Joseph Needham, but a very good book on the nature of the materials involved in organisms.

Basically, it's sort of a portrait of all of the biological elements in particular.

And I think it's good to read a book like that that gives you a personal feeling about copper.

Encyclopedia Britannica, I've noticed that each of several of my volumes spanning about 50 years,

each one has a very unique, very important article that the other issues don't have.

And if you look at each of the biological substances, sulfur, for example, zinc, each element,

I think you should try to get a personal feeling about what its properties are and its potentials.

Is there an internal metabolite that copper associates with similar to how magnesium associates with ATP?

Nothing occurs to me.

It's in competition with iron and molybdenum and in several ways cooperates closely with zinc.

And it's kind of a polar pair with selenium, a reductant and a powerful oxidant.

So from what I understand, copper is retained in proportion to the protein seruloplasmin.

Are there any things that, do you know of things that increase the production of that protein?

Oh, stress and estrogen increase it.

So you don't want too much of it.

And any heavy metal in excess will cause you to overproduce metallothionine,

which will fairly indiscriminately deplete your tissues of heavy metals.

So that's one of the things that heavy metal poisoning does is to sort of clean out other heavy metals along with it.

And then last question on this, but is copper absorbed in relation to the activity of cytochrome C oxidase?

Therefore, if a person's low thyroid, they're not going to need to retain much copper?

I think that's true.

The same way thyroid pulls magnesium into cells by creating its mate,

I think the modifying the cell structure is what pulls and retains copper in.

How would one gauge their copper needs?

Is there any sort of sign/symptom that can be used to ascertain whether somebody needs to eat extra liver

or they have plenty of copper, they don't need to eat liver, etc.?

A good oxidative function and definite evidence that something's going wrong with your copper

is if you're losing pigment in hair or skin or any tissue that should be pigmented.

Great stuff, and we can put a bow on this, but your copper requirement increases during infection.

Do you think that's true, Ray?

I think so.

The body wants to get rid of iron or hide it, and iron is like the evil cousin of copper.

Copper comes in therapeutically.

Thanks for that, Ray. I appreciate it.

Moving on, lidocaine.

I think you were talking to Emma, and maybe you said...

Ray, I think we've talked about this a while ago, but it was just a conversation on the phone.

I think it's interesting that you mentioned it prevents mast cell degranulation.

It's nerve-protective, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-arrhythmia,

memory-improving, anti-cancer.

Then you put it in the classification of pregnenolone, aspirin, sugar, DHEA, progesterone, thyroid hormone.

Anything that you say is very safe is very interesting to me.

Well, one, have any of your thoughts changed about lidocaine?

Maybe, and I'm conscious of time, but maybe an elevator pitch of just what is so useful about lidocaine.

Oh, it has analgesic effects.

It can be used systemically as anesthetic or analgesic, and it has anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects.

Basically, anything which is anti-inflammatory should be checked out in more detail.

It turns out that it is safe in those amounts.

You don't want to use the anesthetic high concentration of 2% or something.

That will kill everything it touches.

But like a periodic systemic dose of 50 or 100 milligrams is probably therapeutic for cancer and arthritis

and a lot of the degenerative things.

And just general anti-aging or anti-stress, you think it's valuable as well?

Oh, it isn't something I would use for those purposes because carbon dioxide has such a perfect spectrum all the way up to analgesia.

In Eugene, do you use carbon dioxide, like just writing or anything?

Do you use tanks or anything like that?

Yeah, I have a tank sitting right beside me.

I've always wanted to ask you that. I don't know why.

Georgie, did you have a question?

Speaking of lidocaine, in doctors and dentist offices, if somebody cannot be treated with lidocaine,

they use a substitute called eugenol.

And it seems to have many of the same effects.

Yeah, eugenol is very pleasant smelling and you can make fillings out of it too.

Mix it with zinc oxide and make some non-toxic filling that if it's properly done, it can last for a year or two.

Have you seen some of the studies with eugenol?

It's also analgesic, it's got anti-tumor effects, it's anti-estrogenic apparently, things like that.

And it seems to overlap some of its effects with lidocaine.

Yeah, and you get it in clove candy and pumpkin pie and lots of places.

It's a familiar chemical to our bodies.

Do you think a similar dosage range, like 50 to 100 milligrams, would be systemically,

somebody who wants to take it internally?

It would be safe to experiment with.

I don't know what uses it might turn out to have.

Can you try it yourself?

Lots of different ways of practicing making fillings out of it and using it for anesthetic and preservative.

You don't want everything to smell like cloves, but it's a good preservative for drying fruit, for example.

Would it be a good thing to try to at least stop the progression of cavities?

It seems to have a powerful antiseptic effect, too.

Yeah, that's why I think the filling material is nice.

Okay, thank you.

Just three more questions, Ray. Thank you so much. Appreciate your time.

Getting rid of citric acid in canned fruits.

You know how dire the fruit situation is.

If people have access to longans or lychees or whatever,

is there a way to mitigate the harm of the citric acid in those canned fruits?

I don't think so.

Citric acid is made in the citric acid cycle, and so people think of it as harmless,

but everything should be in the right place.

Coming in from outside the cell through the cytoplasm to get to the mitochondrion isn't really a safe thing.

There are suspicions that it might be carcinogenic to constantly consume a large amount of it.

So it wouldn't be worth it, the potential risk from citric acid?

Well, just keeping the intake low, using that fruit only as needed.

Good stuff. I'm sure you've probably gone over this question 100,000 times,

but what function is starch having in the low thyroid person?

It's very common to hear, "Oh, I can never, ever give up starch. It has such an essential function."

"Quenching my appetite and living without it seems impossible."

I know I used to feel that way, but I don't feel that way anymore.

Is it a possible low thyroid, under-functioning liver, and maybe the use of starch with fat is slowing down the--?

Yeah, just probably as a guilt-free way of eating sugar.

Sugar or starch can make you feel really good because it lowers stress and keeps you going.

But you have to not forget to take all your nutrients with it.

But I guess what I'm saying is, for a hypothyroid person, starch would be having some--

like the gravitating towards starch, might that be alleviated by supplementing thyroid, do you think?

Oh, immediately, yeah.

I was a huge candy consumer, and a couple of days after I took thyroid, same with coffee,

I didn't have any craving for sugar or starchy foods or even coffee for a spring in the morning.

The thyroid regulates your blood sugar,

so you're more likely to think of ham and eggs or something rather than potatoes and toast.

And then, last question for me, what are the giant doses of vitamin K doing that the lower doses wouldn't do?

I know there was-- I didn't put it in front of me, but there was an article talking about PUFA interfering with vitamin K-dependent processes,

or processes, however you say it.

Is that what the giant 40, 50 milligram doses are doing?

Are they opposing the PUFA that's in the tissues, and that's why they're useful?

I think it's working as an extension of or amplifier of coenzyme Q10.

It associates with that and helps feed energy into the mitochondria.

And you've mentioned for, I think, cancer and also hypertension,

would you assume that larger doses, if a person could afford it because it's such an expensive vitamin,

would that just be useful for any degenerative health problem, do you think?

The Russians tested it on both cancer and brain problems,

and in the '50s, I think, published positive articles on it, but there hasn't been much done.

And I've known people-- the first one was a guy who had pressure of 240 over 70,

a tremendous gap between diastolic and systolic,

and he took one or two droppers full, probably more than 50 drops per day,

and in just a few days, his pressure was down to 140 over 70 and stayed there now for years.

That was my last question. Ray, what are you working on right now?

I just started today thinking that I will pull out some more ideas from the temperature thing.

The idea of the connection between heat shock proteins, estrogen receptor,

and the process of disorder and reestablishing order,

and where heat shock and estrogen work in that system.

And can you let everybody know how to obtain your newsletter?

raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And then the same thing for your books, which they are now available digitally, correct?

Yeah. Awesome. Georgie, did you have something to say?

I think I just wanted to mention that I think vitamin K,

other possible effects that may be causing this--

possible mechanism may be causing this perceived benefit is

it tends to be strongly anti-estrogenic in higher doses,

and also I think it--what was it?

It's converts--it increases the conversion of cholesterol into all of the downstream steroids.

There are several studies showing that very old rats,

when you give them the equivalent of about the human dose of about 100 milligrams,

they immediately get the testosterone of younger rats, the equivalent of 20-year-old rats.

So for an aging male, I think that may also be one of the reasons why they're feeling perked up

and feeling good on vitamin K.

And another recent study found that vitamin K is also an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase type B.

So they compared it to the anti-aging drug Selagiline, I think is the one Ray mentioned a few times.

So that may also be another way that vitamin K is producing these benefits.

Very interesting.

I was going to let you go, but let me read these donations first.

Bob for five pounds, thank you so much, Bob.

Marcello for $50, thank you so much, Marcello.

Michelle for another $50, thank you so much, Michelle.

David for $20.

Marlon for $50.

Holy smokes, wow, guys.

Carlos for $49.99.

Wow.

And that was it.

So I will forward those to Ray.

Ray, thank you so much.

You know, it's always special having you on the show, especially in these insane, weird times.

Georgie, thank you for being with us.

Any parting words I'm going to ask you anyways, Ray?

Nothing.

Okay, thank you again.

Georgie, any parting words?

As usual, stay sane.

I appreciate it.

Thank you, everybody, for watching the show.

We have an amazing audience.

Feel very fortunate to be able to do this and bring it all together.

And a special thanks to Ray for taking the time to do this.

So sincerely appreciate it.

Have a safe weekend, everybody.

We'll talk to you guys soon.

Take care.

Goodbye.

Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures

that are defensive.

Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and

that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest

upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack?

That we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our

own soil or that of our allies?

That formidable technical tench won the accomplished by the British.

Computer technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this

year, may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

The space shuttle is very difficult to do, one would think.

Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and

poured beer.

The designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

Siamese nuclear weapons, Soviet system with our own station with our own taking an important

instant U.S. retaliation.

Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov, how are you guys? Ray, how are you?

First of all.

And Georgie Dinkov?

Not bad, you know, surrounded by more National Guards than I've ever seen in my life, but things are still, I guess, under control.

No civil war yet.

Yeah, what are there, 25,000 troops in DC right now? Is that, it's more than that, right?

That's just the National Guard. There's like, I mean, the place is teeming with like, I would say civilian and undercover cops or like all kinds of, you know, state police.

I don't even know what agency they belong to, but it's pretty obvious there's some kind of a law enforcement because they have guns and, you know, the first sign of commotion because the protests are continuing even after Biden got installed.

But you can see these people are police because they have guns and, you know, as soon as something happens, they pull out their badges.

So there's more, there's more law enforcement on the street than there's people at this point.

I'm sure we'll get into that more, but Ray, you know, we haven't chatted in about a month or so.

Where is the most important place to start, do you think? What's the most critical information to chat about?

That nothing new has indicated that there's a pandemic or epidemic at all.

I was going to say, have you seen the news of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? How many people started suddenly dying in Norway and in Israel?

And basically the effectiveness that they claim is there now, apparently it's not. Twelve thousand people in Israel immediately got infected after getting vaccinated.

And in one county of New York, which had been free of the so-called virus for a whole month, I think it was on the 22nd of December, vaccination started in one nursing home.

They vaccinated 198 old people and in, I think it was only about two weeks, 23 or 24 of those had died.

That is a huge statistical indication that the nursing home people said, well, they had a local epidemic of the virus that happened to kill only the vaccinated people.

Do you think they're dying from the lipid adjuvant or they're dying from the actual mRNA operating system?

I think it's the adjuvant and no one is talking about that. I think they falsely labeled it as a carrier for the RNA when those same things have been sold for years as adjuvants.

So the RNA aspect of the vaccine is less dangerous than the polyethylene glycol lipid adjuvant?

I would guess so.

That's pretty wild.

But for a long range possibility of having the RNA for making the spike protein, which creates inflammation, if we become permanent factories for inflammation proteins, that isn't a good thing.

Did you see the news about the Australian vaccine? I mean, it's already been terminated, but it contains a portion of the HIV virus.

And as soon as they started giving it to people, people started testing HIV positive.

So they freaked out. They shut down the vaccine. They said, don't worry, it's not causing HIV infection.

But I thought maybe they're concerned that, okay, so you have only two choices. Either the vaccine causes HIV infection or the tests that are detecting HIV positive people are useless.

Because what about all these other people that were detected HIV positive that didn't get the vaccine? So which one should we pick?

Yeah, it's nice that there are frauds being put to the test.

And now Lynn Wood, this lawyer here in the United States is saying that apparently some of his friends that got vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, which shouldn't contain any HIV particles, are also testing HIV positive.

Do you think that maybe because of the mRNA somehow activating our internal retroviral, and that's what's causing the positive tests?

And remember, what's his name, the French Nobel Prize winner?

Paul Montagnier.

Yeah. He claimed that he identified some HIV in the stretch of RNA that's used.

So basically, any mRNA vaccine that includes mRNA from the coronavirus, at least this one, it has a chance of triggering an HIV positive test or even worse, basically a chronic HIV infection.

Yeah. I agree with Peter Duisburg, though, that there has never been any evidence that such a virus causes the AIDS condition.

Right. But in any case, it's probably not a positive sign that the retroviral is activated by this vaccine.

Yeah. What will activate a positive test might only take a stretch of two or three nucleotides to be indicating a similarity to the HIV virus.

For the PCR test, if its sensitivity is cranked up all the way to the max, I think right now they're using 40 cycles or something like that for the coronavirus.

If you crank it up even more, can you come up with basically positive tests for pretty much any virus?

Because they're so similar. I mean, there's probably an overlap of at least 10% across all viruses, isn't there?

Yeah. I think they ordered people to test all across the country using that many turns of the cycle because they knew it would create supposed evidence of a big epidemic.

But I'm sure that if they can get a large number of people vaccinated, then they're going to change the instruction, go back to actually measuring something rather than producing false positives for it.

And then use that to claim that the virus eliminated the epidemic.

Probably one of the darkest things I've read, I don't know if we've talked about it on the show before, but the idea that if you deny a vaccine, you don't want to be a guinea pig for an eight-month experimental new technology vaccine, you'll be labeled as a public health threat or a domestic terrorist.

You're a contagion. And there's news trickling out. I'm sure you saw it, Ray. There's some paper in New York about being held against your will in a COVID camp.

So pretty depressing, but you think that will be part of this whole thing is taking people and gathering them together that refuse to get vaccinated?

They're already doing something like that, having the communication websites censor, prevent those people from posting.

Oh, people in the camps can't post?

No, I mean, the general public is being designated effectively a domestic terrorist if they want to post dissenting information. And that was one of Biden's proposals to have a new category of domestic terrorism.

So the government could enforce all of the internet to identify these domestic terrorists and keep them from posting anywhere.

We don't have to dwell on it too much, but what is your rundown of the Trump situation of Biden? I'm sure you're aware of QAnon and them being some kind of, I don't know, people suspect it was a psychological operation, possibly from Israel or something.

But what is your, do you think at this point, the Capitol stuff, was Trump in on it? Was he not who he said he was? Or was he just opposing a power elite that was in complete control?

Yeah, he had the good points, but sometimes he got carried away. And I think QAnon might need a psychological operation himself.

When you first got whiff of that, did you smell fraud?

Yeah, or lack of a sense of reality, basic cultism and lack of critical thinking.

There's some guy named Ward, I forget his name, people are swallowing the strange things that he says. Two or three days later, they haven't happened. And he comes up with a new explanation.

And they keep swallowing it time after time as if their memory lasts only two days.

On YouTube, I followed several channels that really detailed Zionist activities and they were being obliterated off YouTube. And those QAnon channels were getting hundreds of thousands of views and they weren't being censored at all.

And so of course now that has changed a little bit, but it definitely seemed like they wanted people to get into that.

So some people were speculating, was that whole ruse to fulfill the prophecy of white, nationalist, Christian, domestic terrorists now?

Because there's Whitney Webb and other people have been getting sound clips, I forgot the woman's name, but basically saying that this whole phase of whatever is happening right now is going to be turned on domestic terrorists, similar to what we did to Al-Qaeda or whatever.

Yeah, and promoting the crazies on the other side is going to give more backing to the dissenters.

The crazy supporters of authoritarianism are being supported by the official government side, where the dissenters are the ones who will be susceptible to incarceration for their belief.

Yeah, and Whitney also pointed out that they're trying to group Jeffrey Epstein, people that are interested in that with QAnon and Sandy Hook and 9/11.

So they're trying to group all these things together. And so to an average person, they hear any of these words and they immediately dismiss it because they've had such a bad taste in their mouth from the constant press of QAnon, which has been so popularized over the mainstream news channels.

George, do you have any questions? I was going to try to go as back as far as possible, and we can talk about this and everything else, and then we can get into user questions, right?

But my main question was, does this go back to the 200 years ago Battle of Waterloo and how the Rothschilds formed their fortune and then the industrialists, the Rockefellers, and things like that? Is that an effective way of understanding how we arrived here?

I think so. One strand of culture is coming out in insane ways. In the last several years of getting emails on the internet, I've had only maybe half a dozen really insane-sounding people.

But just in the last week, I've had more letters like that than all 20 years that I've used the internet.

I've had people saying that numerology, blaming numerology on the Jesuits, even though it originated in the Old Testament with "In the beginning there was the Word, and the Word was with God."

But the Jewish Kabbalah in particular promoted and amplified this essentialist idea that God spoke Hebrew,

and that every letter and word of Hebrew is a coded message from God.

People like Noam Chomsky studied the Kabbalah as a kid, and that says that you can assert anything that numerology confirms, and you don't need any real-world evidence,

because at least the Hebrew word is with God and defines reality.

Chomsky used it to bypass the people who wanted to explain language as a matter of the brain dealing with the world.

He said, "No, you don't need any evidence at all."

The way you get that scientific view of language is to treat the person and the brain as an absolute black box.

Don't try to look for any information coming from the people who use language and experience it constantly,

because the only thing that counts is this word-derived reality.

So if you don't have words, you can't think. For example, he was saying that his dogs, and I think he called them canines,

don't understand what I'm saying because they have no words. They can't understand anything.

But then he explained that he used the word canine because if he spoke the word dog,

they would make the wrong conclusion that one wanted to do something with them.

So he demonstrated that they are thinking and would draw a mistaken conclusion if he suddenly started using the word dog.

But then he denied that thought is possible without words and that since thought defines mental being,

basically humans are the only ones that count because if they work at it, they can identify the numbers that define the essences of reality.

So there is a deep scientific heresy cutting out empiricism.

This is the greatest danger happening now. Everyone is being discouraged from looking for evidence.

That forces you to rely on the experts and whoever is running the cult of the time.

Wasn't there a campaign of mass sterilizations in the US for people who were deaf and couldn't speak?

So the assumption was that these people were mentally retarded and that's why they sterilized them so they couldn't reproduce?

Yes. I had a professor who said you don't have to worry about anesthesia when you're operating on an animal that's screaming.

It isn't words. It can't say stop cutting and murdering me. So nothing is happening.

So maybe they should try plugging that professor's mouth and operate on him and if he can't say stop, then he's not feeling pain either.

I was a psychology major for a year.

One of my professors, a young and progressive one, said that babies' brains aren't mature until they're about a year and a half old.

So they can't speak or feel pain, therefore you don't need anesthesia if you circumcise them.

Far beyond that, circumcision has been practiced without anesthetic.

Were you saying that the Rothschilds were motivated by the Kabbalah? I'm kind of an intro to all of this stuff.

So the Talmud and the Kabbalah, those are two different books and they're both intertwined with their mindset?

Yeah.

But the Kabbalah is more of an esoteric type of thing or no?

It has penetrated far beyond the extreme rabbinic tradition.

I think the Talmud actually contains these stories that indicate that the extremely religious Orthodox Jews are actually polytheistic.

If you're a known Jewish person, you're not supposed to know about this and if you ask, they're allowed to lie.

At least that's what I've heard.

I've read some commentary on the Talmud and it seems to indicate that it's a description of a polytheistic religion, which of course Zionist people don't want to talk about because officially at least, Judaism is a monotheistic religion, worshipping Yahweh.

Something I didn't realize is that Rothschild wealth is like two centuries older than the Rockefellers. So in that case, were the Rockefellers more of agents of the Rothschilds or did they work together and they wanted to do something similar of taking over the world?

I don't know how much of a mental overlap there was at the time that they got in cahoots,

but I think the Jewish influence tends to permeate other organizations.

Yeah, I think basically they're accurate representations of intentions.

This is on Wikipedia so it doesn't really mean anything, but Ford seemed to be not into the Rothschild thing.

So these 1900s industrialists, like robber barons, was there some distaste for the Zionist approach or no?

Yeah, I think essentialism is what they all develop in context and then reinforce each other's tendency in that direction.

And what is essentialism?

It's the idea that you don't need empirical evidence to develop true knowledge of the world, exactly what Chomsky did with the brain, treating it as a black box.

They, for example, treat the history of an atom as not existing.

This essence of what an atom is applies for all time, everywhere in the universe.

So you don't want to look for the effect of time on individual atoms.

And so they reject that in favor of the knowledge already existing in these ancient books?

Yeah, and the reductionism is generally making that claim that we already know what chemical reactions are and what atoms are.

And so if the organism is nothing but atoms, and atoms aren't to be investigated temporarily, then we have essential knowledge of what an atom is and what chemical reactions are.

And so ultimately, if we reduce the organism to atoms and reactions, we already know everything we need to know about the organism.

It's all there if you practice reductionism.

In a little bit of a change of subject, Bill Gates talked about wanting to put vaccines in foods, putting vaccines in mosquitoes, blocking out the sun, etc.

Since he's trying to toxify the planet in every way imaginable, it got me thinking, do the elites even live here?

I mean, this is actual conspiracy, but do they have something like underground or something? It's wild to think that he's, again, doing all these things and that he's...

Like, couldn't he be bit by one of his vaccine mosquitoes at some point and be killed?

No, I think he's just a true believer in complete essentialism that he doesn't see the meaning for himself.

And then who do you think... and he's obviously kind of in... or a true believer and he's very rich, but is he an errand boy in some way of working for somebody bigger?

Yeah. Whoever has more money...

Maybe Jacob Rothschild?

Yeah, in effect, the way it works is that money rules, and so who has the most money is the one you should look to.

But the money... like, the elites, they don't really care about money. It's just paying people to do evil stuff to fulfill their vision.

Yeah, except I think it's the humanistic, rationalistic, proper way to make a good world.

The multiplication of human beings could fairly quickly kill the earth, but they don't take the rational approach,

which is that as soon as a population is secure in their livelihood, the population of that area stops increasing and begins decreasing.

So all they have to do to control population growth is to enrich the poorest areas first.

Wasn't that Julian Simon's argument?

Yeah, the first person. When was he making the argument?

Maybe the 70s, at the same time Paul Ehrlich was?

Yeah, the one that demonstrated statistically that raising the standard of living would reduce the population was the physiologist in Denver.

He did some of the first free radical studies on cells. I can't think of his name right now.

He was a Renaissance man, though. Many different disciplines.

Yeah, and intelligent in all of them. He just made it absolutely clear that every time it has happened that the population has risen above the starvation level,

where increased children would increase their likelihood of surviving in old age, as soon as you don't need big family, they stop producing them.

Unless Georgi has another question, move on.

I have a question on economics a little bit, and I know we're going to catch a lot of hate.

It's related to Marx and his theory of why capitalism seems to, or at least not capitalist, but like this, the modern state that we've been enjoying over the last 200 years,

why it seems to ultimately always lead to wars and destruction. He calls it the tendency of the profit rate to decline.

Are you familiar with that idea, Ray?

No.

Basically, Marx says that over time in a capitalist production mode society, the means of production of wealth becomes more and more capital intensive.

It tends to decrease the ratio of labor that goes as an input to producing the wealth.

If you're decreasing the rate of labor as part of the production process, ultimately the profit rate will decline because according to Marxist theory, value is only produced by labor, by intelligent labor.

Ultimately, as the capitalists are chasing more and more profit and making the modes of production more and more capital intensive and shunning labor out, the profit rate for these capitalists, for the bourgeois, starts to decline.

Basically, ultimately that leads to conflict between them at the state level and ultimately between states at the world level.

According to Marx, it's just the way the state is structured to produce wealth in a capitalist society ultimately is bound to lead to some sort of a violent conflict because all this money that's in circulation usually has to be paid back with interest.

If the profit rate starts to drop below that interest, eventually you'll get into a situation that cannot be sustained and it leads to war.

Are you familiar with his thought on that?

Not in detail, but he thought that process would lead automatically to socialism.

Lenin's insight was that as long as you can keep developing colonies, including the whole world in the process, every time capitalism is failing, you have to open up new populations.

New colonies, new markets.

Lenin thought that imperialism was periodically, every time capitalism would have died, they expand and organize new markets.

Anti-imperialism becomes an essential opposition to capitalism.

If there are no more colonies, because we live in a fairly developed world already, then ultimately that would have to lead to a conflict because if capitalism fails in some country, there are no more colonies to exploit.

Then the only option that Marx said is to start the destruction of the wealth that was already produced inside of that country and of course guess whose wealth they're going to destroy.

Not the wealth of the rich, but whatever wealth remains in the middle and lower classes so that they can usurp it at pennies on the dollar and basically generate yet another year of profit through desperate means.

I think Stalin's innovation was to try to placate the outside world by declaring socialism against world revolution, socialism in one country.

The problem was that the idea of world revolution was supported by the big imperialists of the US, Germany, and Japan.

All were secretly supporting Trotsky, and so the idea of world revolution is where the extreme anti-Stalin falsifications had to begin.

Okay.

I have questions about World War I and World War II, but I think I'll save them maybe for next time.

Ray, surviving the Great Reset, I think the cards are stacked against everybody, but we're talking about how grim things are and things like that.

Is there anything you can think of?

You've mentioned having a chicken or having a goat or having a cow and being able to produce your own food and that being the wealth currency of the future.

Is there anything else maybe you're doing to protect yourself or that you would recommend to other people to maybe get through the next few years because things are rapidly changing?

Yeah. In the short term, having storable food is logical, but because electricity is essential for ordinary living,

they realize that you can't store perishable food in the freezer because they just have to turn off the electricity for a week at a time and everything is spoiled.

I have a list here. Maybe you could add to it. UHT milk, honey, white sugar, canned oysters, canning salt, frozen meat, not frozen liver, Mexican Coke, coffee, powdered gelatin, powdered milk, applesauce with no additives, canned fruit without citric acid, baking soda.

Is there anything else you can think of that would be good to obtain at the grocery store and stock up?

Ordinary granulated white sugar and ghee and coconut oil are intense calorie sources that are good for medium term shutdown.

And that UHT milk, it says on the, at least the one I have, it says about six months. Can you go even longer on that or does it?

Oh yeah, that's just basically so they can keep selling powdered milk.

So it doesn't expire?

The taste gradually deteriorates if it's exposed to oxygen, but if it's well sealed, I've had some five year old powdered milk.

Is that the same thing as like UHT in that Tetra Pak type of milk? Am I confusing the two?

I don't know what is in it.

Is it like powdered milk, the actual powder versus the type of milk that's in the cardboard, but it's next to the soy milk, like in the grocery store shelves?

Yeah, I've never looked at that in detail. The ultra pasteurized milk, I've eaten it far beyond the expiration date and didn't notice that taste was any worse than when it's freshly made.

Did you see the recent changes by the FDA in the food safety regulations?

They explained that they had to do it because of the pandemic, but now they're allowing vendors that are selling any kind of prepackaged food to basically replace most of the ingredients as the vendor sees fit without changing the label.

In other words, some of the examples are you can be looking at mayonnaise made with coconut oil, and those are pretty rare, but I'm just giving it as an example.

It says the ingredients are eggs, coconut oil, vinegar, etc.

Apparently, the vendors are now allowed to replace the coconut oil with any other oil, which of course means they're going to put either cottonseed or canola oil, whatever's cheapest, and the eggs can be replaced with something of the same color as long as it basically meets the definition of having a consistency of an egg.

How can we even trust the labels at this point in the store as far as the pandemic is concerned?

I'm sure that there are other issues with the labels, but right now it seems that pretty much anything goes when you're going to buy these things in the store.

I've already noticed a few products deteriorate drastically in quality.

Even five years ago, the Department of Agriculture was allowing horrible things to get bypassed labeling requirements as processing agents, for example.

I actually got some of the organic milk brands in Whole Foods that were giving me digestive issues, and I sent some samples to a lab that we work with, and they came back saying that these milks contained silica and gums, even though neither one of these was listed on the label.

Have you written anything about that?

I haven't written anything about that, but I called the vendor, and two of them refused to answer my question.

They didn't pick up the phone, and the third vendor said, "Whatever ingredient is in there, as long as it's under a limit for each one of these ingredients," he said that they're not required to report it on the label.

Basically, if it's less than one gram per serving, I think is what he said.

I think it's important to get that information out.

Okay, understood.

I'll see how I can do it without getting sued.

I'll just say that it's the three or four major brands that are sold at the local Whole Foods, and there are only five or six, so that should be enough for people.

Okay, let's take our first question. Let me minimize the browser here.

Okay, this one's from Anon about vaccines.

Hey, Danny, Georgie, and Dr. Peat. I love the show. I've been listening to it for about two weeks.

Are you guys getting it all choppy and stuff?

Yes.

You can't hear that, right?

I couldn't understand a word of it.

Okay, either could I. I wonder if it's just that question. Let's try another one.

Hey, Danny. Hey, Ray. Hey, Georgie. I have a question about the aging process.

I want to know what would it take to stop aging and reverse the aging process and keep people in a perpetually youthful state?

Like, what kind of therapies or medicine or technologies do we need to be able to achieve something like that? Thank you.

I think the basic process is epigenetic, and it involves small adaptations constantly to an improper environment for our type of organism.

If we can cause all of our adaptations to be directed by our central intention, what we feel ourselves to be and the need,

aging could basically be stopped. Every little adjustment to stress leaves an epigenetic residue in the tissues,

slowing metabolism, leaving the production of energy by oxygen consumption lower while increasing glycolytic energy production.

The consequences of that are to gradually increase flowing proteins like heat shock protein, collagen content of the connective tissues,

and progressive lowering of the mitochondrial processes of each cell. The organism gets drier and drier,

but the individual cells inside this dehydrating framework, the individual cells become more and more inflamed.

I think of running downhill as an extreme example of adjusting in the wrong direction.

If you stretch a muscle under tension, that leaves damage behind and very quickly lowers the oxidative ability of the cell.

Some Canadian exercise physiologists have old people do exclusively concentric exercise in which you don't have any adjustment to the forced extension of muscles.

Our culture is forcing our organism to go ways that it really doesn't want to go.

That's like when you run downhill, the muscle under the force of gravity is being forced to shift to protect against that tearing effect on the muscle.

The muscle enlarges under those conditions, but it's more or less permanently changed.

According to those two exercise physiologists, that can be reversed by a special kind of contraction.

What we need is a general culture that emphasizes what's best for each person.

Your word is surviving in this current situation, it's pretty much impossible to thrive, right?

Yeah, no effort is being made to make things better for everyone.

If an organism is depleted of PUFA, wouldn't the maladaptive process be much slower in terms of intensity?

Yeah, all kinds of experiments have demonstrated that PUFA's accelerate all of the bad processes.

A study just came out today, or at least I saw it today on my newsfeed, and they found out that simply blocking the prostaglandin E2 receptor basically fully reverses any signs of brain aging or any kind of neurodegenerative disease.

I thought, "Oh wow, what a nice and politically convenient way to not implicate PUFA.

Not only does it block the receptor of the prostaglandin, but immediately to the people knowledgeable of the situation, it means that without PUFA there can be no brain aging.

Does that apply to every tissue and organ?

Yeah. The prostaglandin system is sort of the final amplifier of the stress-intensifying, amplifying function.

In terms of controlling the stress reaction, it starts at the hypothalamus, right?

The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that releases things like CRH, the corticotropin hormone, and the TRH, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone?

Yeah. The organism does its best to preserve itself in these bad circumstances.

Several studies have shown that these peptides that the hypothalamus releases, like CRH and TRH, are highly inflammatory.

Now several companies are trying to come up with drugs to block either the release of them or block their receptors at the pituitary level or other tissues.

Do you think there's any benefit in suppressing the reaction of the hypothalamus to stress, external stress?

Good conditions will do it.

Thyroid supplements are one of the important things for keeping down the stress produced by TSH.

There's now a gradually increasing awareness that TSH is what causes the circulatory damage of hypothyroidism.

As the TSH goes up, the deterioration, atherosclerosis, everything contributing to hypertension is created by the TSH itself.

What about something like shining red light on the thyroid or the skull?

I think the whole body exposure to all of the good light is much better than just on the thyroid.

I'm asking just because a lot of people are under lockdown right now and if they can't afford to go outside, would this be like a closed substitute until they're free to go outside?

I doubt that it really helps very much. Getting a thyroid supplement is the surest to work.

Great stuff. Okay, let's take... Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Ray.

Say again?

Oh, I was just going to go to another question.

Oh, okay.

Okay, let me hide this. Let's try that one that skipped a little bit to see if it was... Oh, no. Okay, it's still bad. Okay, sorry, Anon. I'll do your question next time.

That last question was from Abraham. Thank you very much, Abraham. This one's from Oren.

Hello, Ray, Danny, Georgie. I was wondering if you could speak on your views of the history of philosophy.

As a jumping off point, I think that the Hegelian idea that there's progress in history, that history always moves forward, and the post-Enlightenment rationalist project really lead us to where we are now with our current situation with technology and our current conception of man

and how that all ties in with the neo-Darwinist views on the human. I was wondering if you could speak about this as well as how to correctly conceptualize the human organism, as I think that's vital for the health of any age.

I think the idea of intentionality is what governs the organism. In philosophy, there is this big jump in which Edmund Pusherl and Mainong, I forget his first name,

were proposing that you should concentrate on the intentional processes in the brain, but around the same time, the idea of intention as the formative principle of the organism.

If you look at early 20th century embryology, for example, by splitting an early embryo into two or more parts, you would get two or more complete organisms,

showing that it's not just a mechanical process, but there's an intention to become a certain sort of thing. Even considerably changing the conditions of development, those fractions still contain the intention to become something.

Every undesirable experience that the developing organism has is going to divert from its best intentions. That whole process dates from about the beginning of the 20th century.

Mainong and Pusherl were strong influences on Bertrand Russell, who gradually worked it out and moved towards a more empirical understanding.

He brought back a lot of the rationalist and hidden essentialism. His idea of logical atoms sort of semi-consciously incorporated the ideas of strict reductionist Darwinism,

and the implications of racism and imperialism. But Bertrand Russell at least was able to conceptualize that that was an impossible system.

At that point he gave up philosophy and decided he wasn't up to the job because it always leads to the dead end of this anti-empiricism.

When I was reading about the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, Immanuel Kant came up a few times. Is that one of the undesirable philosophies for running the show?

Yes. About 40 or 50 years ago, I wrote a little article that I haven't been able to find on the impact of Kantianism or neo-Kantianism on our culture.

It started in about 1900 and was one of the most evil but widespread influences. I told several people when I was in graduate school about my experience of criticizing neo-Kantianism and

tending to get a B or C on the paper. But every time I found something good in neo-Kantianism, I always got an A on the paper. A couple of people tried that.

A couple of people who had been going along supporting neo-Kantianism got such reactions when they found something wrong with it that they were really annoyed with me.

I'm not an expert on it, but isn't it the idea of collectivism over the individual? So that's kind of like an exact example of what the philosophy states? Like you're getting rejected because you're being kind of an individual?

I don't think so.

What is Kantianism?

Sort of the ultimate denial of empiricism.

Didn't even Kant, toward the end of his life, say that pure rational, idealistic knowledge is impossible? We can never develop it and it always has to be modified?

Yeah, but in practice, we always find a way to remain essentialist and rationalist.

I have a question about potential and intentionality. Would you say that the physiological, the physical basis of intentionality in the human organism is a potential difference between the organism and the environment? So basically the environment always kind of draws us forward because of across that gradient?

Yeah. I think the degree of success that the organism finds in keeping its basic purpose despite the slight deviations, that's what leads to delayed aging, among other things.

So the system that basically prevents the intentional, intelligent action from humans by enslaving them in all these possible ways, that's one of the worst things you can do for the health of the organism or for its future because you block the realization of its potential?

Yeah, leading to depression and cancer and heart disease.

Okay, we'll take another question. Let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Austin.

Hello, Danny and Ray. Thank you for doing this podcast. I always learn a lot. I have a question about the biological processes surrounding vellus hairs turning to terminal hairs. If you look at a baby, like a newborn, you can notice that they basically look like old men where they have very thin, fine hairs on top of their head.

And then at some point, something kicks in, some process happens, and all of those hairs turn to very thick terminal hairs. So my question is, is it possible to do the same thing for people that are undergoing the reverse process of terminal hairs turning to vellus hairs, namely androgenic alopecia or so-called androgenic alopecia?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and obviously I'd love to apply anything you have to offer because I'm dealing with alopecia, as you can see. But I notice I still do have lots of hair. It's just very small and thin, and so if there's some way I could turn those to terminal, that would be awesome. So I'd love to hear what you have to say. Thanks.

I've experimented several times with using DHEA in oil on the sides of my eyebrows that have gradually gone through aging and disappearance.

It took about six months to create new, dark, normal hairs. We were changing the color of topical copper solution.

The very next day, I could see the colored hair beginning at the base. In the case of lost hairs, it was a very slow process.

Speaking of the neonate, what exactly is going on in the hair growth process? People have pointed out that the neonate has the normal horseshoe shape of baldness. What is your take on that?

I don't know. I've never thought about that particular developmental process. I think the androgenic steroids such as DHEA are involved in sickening maturation of the normal hair.

I think there's a difference between the hair type that the baby has and a balding person has. The baby has very low levels of androgens and very high levels of pregnenolone, at least based on the studies that I've seen, while the balding people tend to have high levels of estrogen and prolactin in the scalp.

Both of these hormones, prolactin and estrogen, are known to thin and destroy the follicle and thin the hair. They can actually make a very thick head of hair turn into a very thin mop of hair like that of a very old person.

Just because they look similar, the hormonal underpinnings of both types of hair are very different. At least that's what I've seen in the studies. I think the reason the babies don't have all that thick black hair is, relatively speaking, the low levels of the androgens.

But the thinning of the hair in balding adults, from what I've seen, is mostly driven by prolactin and estrogen and cortisol.

There have been some interesting studies on dogs. Certain dogs became completely bald when their owners started supplementing estrogen on their skin.

Some, in which it happened spontaneously, without an estrogenized owner, the dog was found to have extremely high estrogen levels, which would involve high prolactin too.

Isn't a good indication that estrogen and prolactin are involved in hair loss the fact that most menopausal women start having serious problems with hair falling out, thinning, and in general weakness of the scalp and the follicles?

Yes. The whole menopause supposed estrogen failure is a total fraud created by the industry to sell a product for which it didn't work.

First, they prescribed it to prevent miscarriage, even after it had been demonstrated for several years to predictably cause miscarriage.

Doctors at Harvard promoted the idea for the estrogen companies that supplementing estrogen would prevent premature delivery or miscarriage.

What they were doing was increasing the risk of miscarriage and profoundly damaging the mother and baby.

The first missed period involved the failure to form a corpus luteum, and estrogen stays at the same level.

So at the transition, you're experiencing a sharp drop, almost absolute disappearance of progesterone and the maintenance of estrogen.

In rat studies, they actually bothered to measure what happens to the blood estrogen level when the ovaries are removed.

The few people who bothered testing it found that within a week, the body, which is normal recovery from surgery period, found that the rats were right back to their normal estrogen level but without progesterone.

My dissertation was basically based on the fact that sterility in the middle of the lifespan is caused by an unopposed estrogen.

But the sales system of the drug companies has kept this misguide that there's a lack of estrogen at the menopause.

My recent newsletter, I think it was, temperature falls when progesterone isn't being produced adequately.

All of the symptoms of menopause can be produced by too much estrogen or too little progesterone.

Do you think there's a reason why all the studies with animals, and especially with humans, they always focus on this one type of estrogen, estradiol, as if it's the only type of estrogen that the body produces?

I mean, there are other types, especially things like estrone and its sulfated form.

There have been several studies lately which have called for endocrinology to evaluate its position on menopause because those studies said, "Look, you guys only keep measuring estradiol, and we know it's going to be low because when the ovaries fail, most of the estradiol in the blood comes from the ovaries."

But have you bothered measuring estrone sulfate, which can be easily converted into all of the other estrogens as needed?

If you measure it in menopausal women, it is very, very high.

But the big failure, that's part of it, of failing to recognize that stress, lack of progesterone, shifts the enzyme in the direction that every cell becomes able to convert by reduction.

So, we have to convert estriol or estrone into the 10 times more active estradiol.

The most important measurement that any of the estrogen researchers have made was that they were measuring the estrogen output of the ovary,

and they wanted to control measuring the amount that appeared coming out of the ovary.

They wanted to see how that compared with the circulating serum.

So, they took the vein coming out of the artery and compared the estrogen content to the vein coming out of one arm and found that the arm was producing just as much estrogen as the ovary.

The reason that removing the ovary from rats within a week, the estrogen was back to normal,

the reason is that the whole body is always producing estrogen, and it's the whole body's stress-induced estrogen that has to be controlled for better health.

Last question, then we can move on.

I saw maybe a back and forth with you and somebody about frontal fibrosing alopecia, and that's more common after menopause.

Is that like maybe 50 or 70 years ago, a man would gradually bald over a long period of time?

Is the frontal fibrosing alopecia like an extreme inflammatory type of baldness, like very quickly, like after menopause, and that's what's happening in the scalp there?

Yeah, and one of the things I included in my dissertation was the effect on the whole body collagen system, that estrogen is a major factor in shifting the balance of collagen production.

And you specifically identified PTH in calcium and vitamin D as factors to protect against that, and of course, obviously, keeping the estrogen low.

Yeah, keeping the energy production up, parathyroid hormone, albastrone, lead very strongly both to energy failure and to increased fibrosis of all the tissues.

Awesome. Okay, let me hide this browser real fast. Thank you so much, Ray. Sincerely appreciate it. Guys, give this episode a like, subscribe on BitChute, subscribe on Telegram, and I'll upload this episode immediately after we're done.

I'll do the timestamps and everything. Sincere appreciation to Ray and Georgie for joining me tonight.

These episodes are always really special, and Ray, just an extreme amount of appreciation for you taking the time out of your day to join us.

So let me go ahead and hide this, and this one's from Daniel.

Hey Danny, hey Ray, thanks for having me on today. I just had a question about flare up for Crohn's disease. Do you have any other recommendations besides glycine and collagen? Thanks so much for your time, I look forward to your answer.

You catch that, Ray?

What was the question?

It was about Crohn's disease.

Flare up of Crohn's disease.

Flare up of Crohn's, yeah.

Say it again.

Like a flare up of Crohn's disease?

Oh, undoubtedly estrogen is going to be involved. I've for about 45 years been recommending both thyroid and progesterone, and everyone that has tried it, as far as I recall, has improved their blood sugar.

Improved their symptoms.

What's happening there, is the estrogen like shifting the redox balance of the sensitive intestine and that's causing inflammation?

Yeah. Increased reduction is the same as failed oxidation.

I've seen a few other studies demonstrating that since estrogen is known to compromise the gut barrier, it allows bacteria to start invading the wall of the colon and the small intestine.

Older studies demonstrated that you can actually put inflammatory bowel disease in remission by gonadectomizing the animals, and they thought this was because the androgens or the progesterone was removed depending on whether the animal was male or female.

But subsequently they administered androgens to the gonadectomized males or progesterone to the gonadectomized females, and they discovered that they stay in remission, which I think proves irrefutably that estrogen is the direct cause.

One thing I wanted to mention also about vitamin D, apparently there were studies in the '80s, not many, that treated Crohn's disease with a synthetic form of vitamin D, which was used only because it was profitable, but it still had the same effects as the regular vitamin D3 that we know about.

They were able to put Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in remission by administering 100,000 units weekly.

I've had a few people comment saying that they tried putting 50,000 units weekly in their navel if it was dissolved in oil, and apparently it helped resolve a lot of their symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.

Do you think vitamin D is also involved, Ray?

Yes, I think it is for sure effective taken orally.

The things that reduce inflammation, cure all sorts of chronic diseases, and the symptoms of the pandemic, so-called virus,

are quickly reduced or eliminated with all of these anti-inflammatory substances, which could be a dose of 50,000 or 100,000 orally of vitamin D.

Just a single dose to get started is good. And progesterone and aspirin, everything that is a safe anti-inflammatory agent has been used against all of these diseases.

Ray, didn't you know vitamin D was toxic?

Yeah, I've heard that a thousand times.

Have you seen any direct evidence of vitamin D's anti-estrogenic effects?

I mean, there are some studies that talk about receptors, but I know you're not a fan of just the receptor effect, it's the whole cell that needs to be taken into account.

Do you know of any studies that compare it?

The receptor is a good sign of deficiency of vitamin D. As you become deficient in the 25-hydroxycholecylciferol,

you begin to produce both the receptor and the so-called active vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecylciferol.

Part of the toxicity, people get very confused and fail to work out the ramifications of the so-called active vitamin D and receptor

as being associated with a lot of toxic harmful effects that are reduced by adequate calcium and the not active form of vitamin D.

It's actually active, but it isn't what they call active.

I was reading a few days ago about calcitriol or 1,25-dihydroxy being associated with prolactin and growth hormone, so it certainly seems like the people advocating for that approach aren't considering these other things that you have plugged into your whole beautiful picture of physiology.

Okay, so let me hide this one. We were just talking about digestion, so let me play this one from Will.

One other question. What about the interaction of vitamin D3, cholecylciferol, with estrogen? They seem to oppose each other. Have you seen any studies or any experiments done that demonstrate this more directly?

Yeah, I can't think of the references right now, but I've seen good evidence of opposition of good vitamin D and calcium to the effects of estrogen.

Does intracellular calcium turn on aromatase?

Yeah, excitation of the cell generally turns it on stress, tendency to be on the test pathway.

That is part of the aging process, and it gradually increases the amount of estrogen coming out of your arms and legs and fat and other parts.

But a deficiency of dietary calcium also increases aromatase because it increases PTH, right?

Right. Like a deficiency of good vitamin D, calcium deficiency increases stress and activates the whole system, and endotoxin, aldosterone, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen.

Great stuff. Thank you, Georgie. Thank you, Ray. Okay, let me hide this. And this one is from Will.

Hi, Ray. Hi, Danny. I was wondering, for someone who has utilized the carrot salad, white button mushrooms, antibiotics, and other strategies, yet still has chronic endotoxin symptoms and low total cholesterol, what would be some good strategies to both lower those endotoxin symptoms as well as increase the total cholesterol?

Great care with what you eat is part of it. Anything that irritates your bowel is a risk.

Finding the diet balance, sometimes you have to be fairly extreme to start improving the whole situation.

Sometimes going to a strange, different form of fiber in your diet can help. Each one might not be right for a certain person, but usually by trying out different ones, you can find a dietary fiber that reduces inflammation.

What about a bacteriophage, erythromycin, penicillin, or tetracycline?

All of those sometimes help.

I have a question. I know you've spoken favorably of charcoal, but you've also cautioned against many products that are on the market because you think they may absorb into the bloodstream and cause an allergic reaction. Wouldn't combining the charcoal with the carrot salad reduce those risks while still allowing the charcoal to do its magic in the gut?

It does seem logical, but it's something I would prefer to leave to rat experiments because of the fact that any kind of unmetabolizable particle, if it gets preserved, basically kills off part of your whole system.

Have you used charcoal yourself in the past, or have you found any brand that used to work in the past, even if not now?

I think I tried it once, but after thinking more about it and about presorption, I decided it was something I didn't want to keep trying on myself.

Wouldn't overcooked mushrooms, if they're overgrilled, contain a bit of charcoal?

Probably a small amount.

Great. Do you still have confidence in fluorescents or the bacteriophage?

I've used it several times, and some of the products I saw slight improvement, but nothing spectacular. So I haven't kept trying it.

And where would you place that against something like Biosporin?

Biosporin can be very powerful because it's producing a broad spectrum antibiotic. The bacteria in it are producers of antibiotics.

And then there's an over-the-counter product called Megasporbiotic. It's kind of expensive, but it does contain the B. subtilis and the B. licheniformis that Biosporin has. Do you have any confidence in that?

I tried it once, and it didn't seem to work the same as Biosporin for me.

The only bad part about Biosporin is it's very difficult to obtain, especially right now.

Yeah, and I think it contains a preservative from the smell of it.

When I used it, I would let it sit in a glass of milk at room temperature, wait until there was a delicate coagulation of the whole glass, and then I would put that in the refrigerator and use only a spoonful of it per day.

So the extreme dilution of the preservative wouldn't be a factor. That was how I always used it.

How long does it take for a colon or for a gut that has been sterilized by any means to get recolonized by bacteria?

It sometimes happens in a week, but sometimes people don't manage to get it.

I'm asking because I've had a few people email me asking about replacing antibiotics with things like coconut oil.

I know you've said it can be irritating to the GI tract, which they seem to confirm, but those people reported that after eating a few tablespoons daily, they got loose stools, but after that they felt blissfully for more than a week.

Do you think that's due to the antibiotic effect of coconut oil?

Yeah, it's effective against both fungus and bacteria, but you have to make sure that you are allergic to it.

Hey Ray, I don't know if there's anything you can do about it, but your volume goes from real low to really high, so I don't know if it's just the phone placement.

Anyways, let's skip on here. Let me hide this and we'll go to another question.

Thank you so much, Ray. Thank you, Georgie, for making this possible. Sincerely appreciate it.

Instead of waiting until the end of the show, Ray, why don't you let everybody know how they can subscribe to your newsletter?

The site for ordering it is raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com

And that's $28 for 12 issues over 2 years?

Right.

And then they can order your books by contacting that same email, correct?

At the same address, yeah.

Awesome. And what are you working on right now?

Aging of the cell. Following up things that were left out of last month on the effect of temperature.

I concentrated on cold the last time, and this one's going to concentrate on the energy deficit effect,

which can be produced by heat stress or reductive stress or any kind of stress that goes with energy deprivation.

I was listening to your last interview with Patrick Timpone and you were saying the likely cause of many deaths is just the temperature getting too low. Is that right?

Yeah.

And it's totally not scientific to label a cause of death as COVID-19.

Yeah, and a lot of people don't bother checking the temperature of your mouth, eardrum, and extremities.

Old people in particular, their brain might be at a good temperature, oral 98.6, eardrum 99.5, for example,

but they're producing less energy and that shows up as an extreme gradient from the extremities to the brain area.

Keeping that in mind, paying attention to the outside temperature, that can have a profound effect.

The indoor temperature might be 70 degrees and seem perfectly safe, but even through ordinary insulated walls,

the outside temperature can profoundly drain your body's energy-producing ability and create that gradient effect.

That means that your system is experiencing stress everywhere, even though the brain is maintaining its own temperature.

It's also perceiving that the bulk of your body is being de-energized.

That's because such a large percentage of our biological energy goes out as radiation.

Something like three-quarters of the energy we produce goes out as microwaves and infrared.

If it isn't reciprocated by returning radiation from something approaching body temperature,

having an outside temperature of 45 degrees, for example, your body is draining vastly more energy than it would be in the summer with 80-degree weather.

That's why aspirin and a snack before bed and maybe progesterone and thyroid are so important right before you go to sleep.

Yeah.

I have a question about the cell aging.

What do you think, Ray, is the main factor responsible for the hardening of that liquid crystal, which is what the cell is?

Is it mostly lipophosphine or are there other factors involved as well?

Yeah, everything you can think of is involved.

Parathyroid hormone, for example, is very powerful along with aldosterone, for example, and nitric oxide, collagen, everything is shifting in a harmful way.

So it's an accumulation of some pathological proteins too, right?

It's not just the fats in the iron, but the proteins and collagen and things like that.

Intercellularly, you have things like the heat shock protein or the stress chaperone proteins.

Those are protective in some situations and become part of the epigenetic damaging influence as they accumulate in the stressed cell itself.

Would, in general, reductive stress, even in a younger cell, also lead to a hardening in an electronic fashion just because there are excessive electrons that are not there?

Yeah, but also by activating other changes such as the heat shock protein.

Great stuff. Okay, just a few more questions, Ray, and we'll let you go. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Sincerely appreciate it.

Let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Brandon.

Hey Danny, hey everyone. So I have a question for Ray regarding koshodama or sacred sound mantra practices and how this top-down approach modulates stress hormones by toning the vagus nerve.

And how adopting practices like this are a really good complement to all the biological understandings that I think Ray and all you guys bring forward.

And just curious if he has a perspective on that and/or really any of you guys and what other potential top-down approach might be suggested like that, like meditation, breath work, mantra practices, things of these nature.

I don't know why I look over here all the time. It's the damn things over here.

Yeah, sleep deprived. Anyway, love you guys' work and just want you all to know all this free content you give makes a huge impact.

My health is way better. My client's health is way better all because of this amazing content that you guys continue to produce.

So I am greatly appreciative of everything. So I wish you all a groovy one and I'll tune in for more shows as always.

What do you think, Ray?

Shock is the extreme degree of most of these things we've been talking about.

Estrogen, Hans-Jelly was the first one to propose the idea that estrogen imitates a shock reaction.

And I think that applies to many of the stimulating techniques of the vagus nerve. You have to be very watchful for estrogenic influences when you specifically stimulate the vagus.

Okay, we'll jump to another one. Thank you, Brandon. Thank you, Ray. Let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Jake.

Hey, I had a quick question for Ray. So Ray, I know you had mentioned on a previous podcast that there's a possibility in the future of the earth releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide,

which could lead to a planetary-wide shift in consciousness or thinking for the population.

And I'm wondering, I have two questions. So the first question is, with this kind of a sudden increase in carbon dioxide, do you think that there's a possibility that there's an intelligence of the earth that could sense kind of a crisis situation on the planet and initiate this rise in carbon dioxide globally?

And my second question is, as a follow-up, what kind of indications, either biological or cultural indications, would suggest that this kind of event of increase in carbon dioxide is likely to happen at a certain point? Thanks. Bye.

I didn't catch the last part of it, but the first part, I think the earth is basically doing the best things it can.

Melting tundra ice is releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. And if the earth is expanding, as some of the measurements over the last half century have suggested,

an expanding earth would be diluting the atmosphere, resembling high altitude even at lower altitudes.

So an expanding earth could improve our atmosphere as well as releasing more actual CO2 into the air. But what was the last part of the question?

I think it was something about carbon dioxide and what would that do culturally? Like a higher amount of... I might be misremembering.

Would it lead to a higher consciousness?

Yeah. That happens at high altitude when you see both acceleration and reduction of the stress hormones.

When T3 increases, cortisol doesn't increase at high altitude. And the brain metabolism, oxidative metabolism, increases with higher CO2.

And that greater consumption of electrons, I think, is tending to keep the brain in a positive, productive, more conscious condition.

I have a kind of a goofy question, but it's been a long-standing interest of mine. Ray, we seem to have been inundated with recent UFO news and disclosure and "no longer in the shadows, Pentagon's UFO unit will make some findings public."

Without me coloring the issue at all, what is your take on the general UFO agenda?

I think it's a risk. I think there is a risk in a time of crisis.

And a lot of us will be declared domestic terrorists for doubting Fauci. It will be a welcome distraction. Get people's minds off the critics.

You mentioned David Sheehan a few times. Wasn't he kind of a UFO guy? What is your take? Clearly, the news loves talking about UFOs, but they don't want to talk about 9/11 or bankers or other CIA or other actual problems.

Is it purely an agenda for control? Like, there was that CIA project, Project Blue Beam, I think in the 90s. Is it some kind of tool in the oligarch toolbox of control?

It functions that way, but it's hard to tell whether it's just the silliness of the broadcasters and newspapers who know what they shouldn't write about. It's on the safe list, at least.

Could any of these events or crafts be really from extraterrestrial beings?

It's a possibility, but I would give priority to all kinds of government fraud over actual evidence of aliens.

The fact that it's being released specifically now makes it that much more suspect.

At times, it was clear that they were doing something that they created a very silly excuse for why people were seeing certain things, such as experimental luminous releases in the stratosphere.

They had to disguise it as saying it was slump gas or some natural phenomenon to avoid having to explain that it was some very interesting,

but secret military process.

Great stuff. Okay, thanks for that, Ray. It's a burning question of mine since I was a young lad. Okay, let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Nick.

Hey guys, big fan of the show. My question for Ray is if the mechanism of MDMA is a big release of serotonin, flooding the brain with serotonin, and serotonin is a stress chemical, then why do people feel so happy and loving when they're on MDMA?

I've read about it online and it sounds like there's a little bit of dopamine and norepinephrine release, which maybe that would be what accounts for that, but it seems like, at least according to the mainstream view...

Sorry, go ahead, Ray.

What kind of DNA?

He's talking about MDMA, the drug, like the party drug that...

Ecstasy.

Ecstasy, yeah.

Obviously, it's releasing a lot of processes in the brain and the fact that it damages the brain. I think the damage comes from the excess serotonin, but I would guess that the things that go along, in general, over-excitation of the brain, I think that's...

Where the good feeling comes in.

Is this kind of like a cultural cliché to say that, "Oh, this drug makes me happy, therefore it's increasing my serotonin"?

Yeah, it is strictly a cliché.

I think it's a dose-dependent effect. Currently, MDMA is in clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers and they found out that, really, at very low doses, where you almost don't even get the psychotropic effect, it has a powerful antidepressant and antitrauma effect.

The animal studies that were accompanying the human ones showed that this is tied to a large release of dopamine and a drop of cortisol.

So, my opinion is that MDMA is serotonergic, just like LSD, only if you abuse it in very high doses.

Ray, was this question difficult for you to hear on the phone? There's another part of it, but I can summarize it for you if you couldn't hear it.

No, I couldn't hear it exactly.

Actually, I don't know if I can summarize it. Maybe George can listen to it and summarize it for you. Let me fast forward.

Like hostile and things like that, why does MDMA seem to have the opposite effect?

My second question, if you're willing to do two, is has Ray ever looked into Chinese medicine very much? The philosophy seems really similar.

Okay, I'll just stop right there. But it was about Chinese medicine being very similar to the Otto Warburg, Albrecht St. George, your idea of energy and structure.

Yeah, I was very impressed by Joseph Needham's books on Chinese science and technology. He was such a good biochemist in England.

He did a very objective survey and summary of Chinese philosophy and other sources.

I found it very interesting how acupuncture can work. I don't agree with any of the Western theories of what acupuncture is doing.

I think the Korean theory activates the movement of exosomes to restore tissues is so far the best theory.

Okay, we'll do one more and then we'll call it a day. Again, Ray, thank you so much for taking two hours out of your day to chat with us.

Sincerely appreciate it. Okay, let me hide this browser. And this one's from Tim.

Hey, Daniel Ray, the bit that you just realized this is probably really hard to understand, but you'll just go through it.

The little part where you were talking about physiology and you talked about if you're not in the euphoric state, then there's something wrong with you. I'd love to know more about that. That's fascinating.

Did you catch that, Ray?

Not at all.

He's actually referencing one of our older podcasts where you said if you're not in the euphoric state, that means you're degenerating. Tim was asking if you could expand on that.

Oh, yeah. Things like carbon dioxide, adequate oxidation of glucose, these things should give you a 24-hour-a-day euphoria.

And anything that interferes with this highly efficient energy production is amplifying damage, leading to permanent damage from inflammation.

So, you aren't metabolizing, right?

And just to define euphoria for everyone?

That life feels good.

And maybe with... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

Feeling your breathing, feeling your heartbeat, and feeling the blood circulate through your tissues, all of that is background. All of it feels good. And so it gives a general tone to everything you're thinking and doing. It makes them feel good, too.

I identify with that. There are times I'm excited to get to work and answer an email and things. Is it possible to maintain that feeling in the current situation? You've been aware of things and how they've been progressing for much longer than I have.

But how do you maintain frame and euphoria when you know that, especially this last year and this year, are going pretty miserably?

Yeah. And the common condition... You know, doctors have been thinking of euphoria as something dangerous.

If thyroid leads to euphoria, they'll tell you to stop taking it.

Because they think of those good feelings as not quite compatible with life.

And the whole business of living is this background of feeling your blood circulate and energy being produced.

If you ask a person to pay attention to their heart beating, they often get nervous.

And the first reaction when a person takes an exactly right dose of thyroid, one typical response was, "Thyroid is love."

A feeling that radiates out of the chest, all of the good feeling nuclei throughout the body, all of these are intensified by thyroid.

Your heart is one of the major emotion sensors.

If you're low in thyroid, then those same areas of your body that should be sensing the pleasure of living are reporting anxiety.

People feel anxiety around their heart and chest, but the right response to it, getting the right dose, the experience of love, is probably the best description to what the euphoria of metabolism is doing.

That's awesome. I'll let you go.

I have a question about carbon dioxide and euphoria.

Since carbon dioxide improves metabolism and really leads to higher states of consciousness, shouldn't carbon dioxide produce similar effects to the psychedelic drugs like LSD or ayahuasca or whatever the shamanic people are using if inhaled in higher amounts?

Are you aware of any studies that compare them in that way?

No.

Just to follow up, one last question. You mentioned you had a tank of carbon dioxide next to you last time we talked, and I got a dozen emails about how specifically you were using it. Do you want to share that info?

When the weather is so cold, I sometimes sit at the computer with my legs in a big plastic bag plumped up with carbon dioxide. It helps to increase warmness.

I need to try that. Thank you for that, Ray. Parting words, Georgi Dinkov.

As you should, stay safe and stay healthy, I guess, because if things are getting more authoritarian, I think it will be harder for people to spend enough time watching their health, but it becomes that much more important.

And Ray, one more time, let everybody know how they can subscribe to your newsletter and obtain your books.

(bright music)Hey everyone, we just got wrapped up with our last live stream, number 51 with Ray Peat, and we had tons of issues with bandwidth and the sound is kind of popping every so often.

And so it's extremely imperfect, and so it's not up to the quality of the other streams, unfortunately. I don't even know what happened. I'm still going to try to figure it out.

But I still obviously wanted to release the episode. I've stitched together some of the long silences, unfortunately, that happened during the show.

And at about 1 hour and 22 minutes and also an hour and 34 minutes, I had to stitch those together because there were long periods of silence.

So here it is. It's again, the quality is not amazing. And again, it's like popping throughout the whole episode, but I thought it was really excellent otherwise.

And I thought we covered a lot of new ground. So I hope you guys like it. And yeah, we'll try to do better next time.

Okay. Talk to you guys soon. And here's the episode.

Okay. Georgie has a small window here. So guys, we're having a little bit of bandwidth problems, but we do have Mr. Raymond Peat, Mr. Georgie Dinkov. Ray, how are you?

Very good.

Georgie, how are you in your small, low bandwidth box?

Still hanging in there, like surrounded by the National Guard.

Okay. So we have something to anchor this show in. And so Ray just wrote a fantastic newsletter, riffing on ideas that I hear few people talking about.

So Ray, your newest newsletter just came out a few days ago, if I'm not wrong, but it's cumulative damage, degeneration and aging possibilities of reversal.

And it had a lot to do with the heat shock protein. So that was the part I was vaguely familiar with. But maybe, I don't know, do you want to talk about just giving your motivation for writing it?

Oh, it's part of the general picture, how to understand biology usefully. And the reductionist, breaking it up into parts, you can have an infinite amount of that kind of knowledge and never be able to do anything with it.

But if you are actually under the principle of how the organism works, bacteria don't have any of our ordinary analytic abilities,

but they have the intelligence and computational ability that lets them redesign themselves radically to meet a challenging environment.

And Barbara McClintock showed that that same sort of redesigning your genome happens in plants. And it should be obvious that if bacteria and plants can radically pick themselves up and change themselves to do better in the world,

there's no reason why people should feel that they're weighted down by the horrible ballast of genes inherited from reptiles or whatever.

And the factors of this simplifying picture are the physics of phase change, essentially what Gilbert Ling was talking about,

but what was a major movement early in the 20th century for understanding the origin of life and what life is in its basis.

And that view that life is a substance rather than an accumulation of 20,000 independent pieces of DNA, that idea of life as a substance,

it can change the phase in one direction of losing energy or it can, with good luck, come back to a high energy state because all of the parts are subordinate to the flow of energy managed by the whole organism itself.

And you talked about, I'm going to butcher his name, La Chatelier's principle. And so the first, I don't know if this is related, I think it's related to Barbara McClintock, but a long time ago, maybe you had said that you read a paper or there was a situation where a cave of fish,

fresh river fish were diverted into a cave and then over a period of time, they lost their eyes, became clear, and they basically adapted very quickly to their environment. But that's along the lines of Barbara McClintock's research, right?

Like inborn capacity to change given a new novel or even an inhospitable environment.

- [DH] Oh yeah, the encyclopedias that I read as a kid reported those experiments. The regular mainline encyclopedias included the Lamarckist experiments.

And when I was in graduate school, there were still people doing experiments of that sort. Previously, they had done them with various sea organisms and plants, hybridizing plants by grafting branches to them, causing a change in the whole organism.

These experiments with fruit flies, since fruit flies were the main organism, the genetics dogma based itself on bacteria, single-celled organisms, and then finally fruit flies.

Two different kinds of experiments. One fed fruit flies a very high salt diet, and they adaptively changed their cuticle so that it wasn't irritated by the flow of salt in and out.

Their anal scales were toughened up, and putting others under a very hot artificial light caused the wing structure to thicken up and get thick veins.

So these were strictly first-generation adaptation to a stressful environment. Then they turned off the light and gave them a normal salt diet and cross-bred them.

From then on, they could have a Mendelian-like inheritance of these traits that they had never seen before in fruit flies.

They sorted out generation after generation with the thickened scales and the thickened veins in their wings. I asked several of my professors about that, and the standard action was those were hidden genes.

They were there all along, and once they expressed them, then they were able to continue expressing them.

But that is the scientific method genetics is based on. If it happens, then it must have already been there in these immortal genes because nothing new happens.

So it's better than a deus ex machina. It's saying that, "Well, we knew that already. You didn't do anything except we hadn't previously expressed that gene, but it's immortal and it's always been there."

So to get into the bulk of your newsletter about the heat shock proteins, you start off by talking about Gilbert Ling. I flipped through his book again, and he's talking about ATP, what did he call it? The par excellence or the queen of cardinal adsorbents.

So that's something that's helping or critical for the electron flow or pulling electrons through the cell and doting to oxygen. ATP has to be, what's the right phrasing? Lost in the cell for this phase transition to happen?

Yeah. I mentioned that it functions as a protein solvent, and so if you lower your energy and don't have the ATP binding it and keeping the cell together, some proteins come out of solution and go into a different phase.

So these become stress-induced organelles, but they always depend on the situation, the type of stress.

So the way the protein comes out of solution when the cell is de-energized is shaped by the other factors acting on the organism.

The practical use of that idea is something that has been noticed ever since experiments by St. Georgie that ATP has a softening, relaxing effect on isolated protein material from cells.

Exactly the idea of keeping everything together and in solution in the cytoplasm or the coacervate or the whole protoplasm.

In a fatigued muscle, for example, the muscle gets harder and harder and when it's fully energized, the cytoplasm is flexible and soft but can in a moment contract and do a maximum of work.

Like a fatigued heart gets harder and harder, but on stimulation it's already tight and hardened and so it can't do much more to become tighter.

So the ATP functionally represents the flow of energy, carbon dioxide produced from oxidizing glucose, for example.

The energized well-nourished cell is in a relaxed state and that has to do with insomnia, muscle cramps, all the biological functions all the way down to cancer, for example.

Cancers can be adequately diagnosed just by their hardness. Doctors have noticed that if a lymph node is hard to the touch, it's going to look cancerous on the inside if they cut it open.

But the hardness involves first the inability to relax and then the stabilization of a fibrous form of actin, one of the mobility producing proteins of any sort of cell.

And then the depleted energy turns on collagen synthesis and the actin, which is hardening the cell from the inside, attaches to this growing collagen produced surround and you get a system that is harder and harder the more energy depleted it is.

Was St. George the person who did the experiments with injecting ATP into dead animals and he showed that it reverses the rigor mortis?

Yeah, rigor mortis is the phase change and when you get smaller degrees of that phase change, then you get chronic things like intracellular bodies that produce anything from arthritis like inflammation to dementia, formation of prions.

Proteins that are no longer soluble becoming the mad cow or Alzheimer's agent.

So this is happening, this precedes cellular division, correct? Like when a cell is extremely stressed out?

Oh, yeah, promoting cell division is one of the alternatives and you want to lose the complex energy consuming cell functions, thought and organization and secretion, all of the fancy specialized things cost energy.

And to escape from whatever is causing the stress and the damage, turning off the differentiated functions and resorting to simple cell division, making new cells hoping that they will survive and overcome the environment.

So the hardening process is broken free of by activating the de-differentiating cancer producing property.

Are you familiar with some studies published I think in the 80s showing that niacinamide is actually also a great substance for increasing solubility of pretty much anything it gets called dissolved with?

I saw some studies showing that if you mix niacinamide and let's say something very lipophilic like progesterone, it increases its solubility in water by a few thousand percent.

And then they tried a few different substances and niacinamide increased the solubility of many different proteins that weren't very soluble in water.

So I'm wondering if considering the similarity or the importance of niacinamide as an NAD precursor and the relationship with ATP, whether niacinamide can fill in for some of those roles that ATP has as a solubility increase.

Yeah, it does and it's able to stop the energy loss. It turns off some of the deranged DNA repair mechanisms and can just let the cell die peacefully rather than draining tremendous amounts of energy.

So it plugs the leak and that solubility thing has all degrees of visibility.

About 1971 or 2, I was experimenting with things like bread dough. I was making bread at the time and the relation of water retention to the bread dough is a big factor in the texture of the bread.

I was thinking of the bread dough as an analog for the cytoplasm and what happens when the cytoplasm is energized and relaxed or stressed and tensed up.

I tried different stimulants and sedatives and found that the free water content of barbiturate was one thing I tried.

It made the dough slippery and wet because it was unable to hold the water in solution and stimulants like caffeine, which also has a solubilizing effect on other substances.

It made the dough bind water and retain more water. So it could be very humid containing a lot of water and still not be wet and slippery.

Would gelatin have some of those effects as well, increase the solubility of intracellular proteins?

Would which?

Gelatin.

It would probably depend on the starches present. One of the classical examples for studying coacervation was to make gelatin and gum Arabic starchy molecule.

They handle water in different ways according to their proportion. Gelatin is bound to run into things like RNA and polymer carbohydrates that will affect the water holding properties.

If I'm reading this correctly, an excess of unpaired electrons, which is what happens when metabolism is impaired, would greatly inhibit the solubility of proteins inside the cell, right?

Mm-hmm.

So things that accept those electrons like quinones or other oxidizing agents, they should improve the solubility of proteins and retain the gelatin-like structure of the cell.

Yeah, and that should involve a constant flow. When the excess electrons are being drained away quickly enough, that is the living state.

It should be constantly active with electrons flowing into the electron vacuum of oxygen.

So some of those effects of estrogen on activating the heat shock proteins and decreasing the solubility of proteins in the cell, does that have to do with the activity of estrogen as a reductant?

Yep. That's its molecular structure. The phenolic structure shifts the electrons away from oxidation and changes the whole water protein system so that while stopping oxygen energy production,

it activates the enzymes that govern glycolysis and lactic acid metabolism.

And the role of progesterone as an inhibitor of HSP formation, is that a direct effect or does it have more to do with the opposition of progesterone to estrogen's effects?

Its direct action is probably on proteins in general, not just a protein of progesterone receptor, but it is currently effective on a great variety of proteins,

including the cell division apparatus and motility and conductivity and so on.

And it is one of the things that helps the cell retain water under control, but not having the wetting property where estrogen releases water from proteins,

it makes them swell up with bulk inactive or glycolysis-supporting water. Progesterone causes the water to be bound into a solution with the proteins and excludes the pre-bulk water.

Maybe we'll back up just a second here. People in the health world, they say you should activate these heat shock proteins to sit in a sauna for hours or something, and these help a person resist stress. How do you see that?

That's true that they will help a cell survive partial cooking and so on. That's where the whole idea of them being strictly beneficial, that they do help survival of terrible conditions,

like being poisoned by germs or cooked by excess heat or starved by energy depletion. But the drug companies are among the first to become aware that that process,

de-energizing cells, turning them towards the lactic acid, cancer-like or stress-like metabolism, that the whole energy of the cell goes down.

As the life of the cell is saved by the heat shock proteins, its energy tends to revert to that simple cancer metabolism that loses the basic function of what the organism was trying to do.

So the drug companies are producing chemicals that they hope will be non-toxic that will reverse the process, knock out the heat shock proteins and restore cells, bringing them back from the cancer or stress metabolism.

I might have not clipped it out of your newsletter, but didn't you say that the activation of the system, it was kind of like you'll never – I know there's a sticky statement, but you'll never be the same again?

Like you'll have stepped backward and the heat shock proteins will basically leave some kind of scar that the ability to generate energy won't ever be like it was before that activation? Does that make any sense?

That's the general line of aging. It's like a ratchet that keeps you alive for the moment, but each time it is called on for that short-term survival, it reduces your flexibility just like a scar. It plugs a hole, but it limits function.

If you get your attention on the whole coacervate-like quality of the organism, getting rid of that high quantity of heat shock proteins at the same time that you're energizing the whole cell,

and it happens that progesterone has many layers of functions blocking and reverting away from the heat shock state and activating the right kind of energy production, suppressing lactic acid metabolism,

antagonizing estrogen, blocking collagen production, all of the levels happen to be touched on by progesterone.

I wanted to make a point that you mentioned the heat shock protein 70 and the involvement of estrogen and nitric oxide in activating it, but there are a lot of studies showing that the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis is actually just as potent in cortisol specifically.

Not only it increases the production of this protein, but actually that protein is required for cortisol to bind to its receptor and cause all the downstream effects that exist.

It seems that any type of stress, not just heat, is capable of activating or increasing the synthesis of these heat shock proteins.

De-energizing the cell.

Exactly. So I guess it's a bit of a misnomer to call them heat shock proteins. They're more like stress shock proteins or just shock proteins in general.

Yeah. They block the disorganizing factors that come from everything that de-energizes the cell.

So if I understand correctly, any event that the organism is exposed to that demands production of energy to deal with, which is really any event in life, if the energy production is not sufficient to meet the demand, then the heat shock proteins will get activated.

So in other words, aging occurs every time there is a demand on us placed by the environment that we cannot meet up energetically.

Yep. And if you pay attention during stress, you can learn to see the taste in your mouth and the odor of expired air through your nose, for example.

You can tell when the energy supply is under stress and basically aging is happening when you see these signs.

For example, if you stay in a hot bath too long, you start getting weak and feeling stress. And at an extreme, you can get a metallic taste in your mouth and a dry, odd odor in your exhaled breath.

And you realize that if you have a pint of orange juice or so, you can stop those processes and get things working again.

What's that metallic taste in the mouth due to? Is it truly because there's some metal that's getting unbound from cells?

No, it's just lipid peroxidation. When the free fatty acids reach a certain point, anything available as a catalyst will start lipid peroxidation.

And since metals cause it, we associate that taste with metals. But you don't need the metal because it's the lipid peroxides you're tasting.

So if your breath starts smelling like ketones or ammonia, all of these are also signs that you've overstressed yourself.

We already talked about estrogen increasing the heat shock proteins. Just going back to an old email that you and I had, Ray, you said, "Estrogen, hyperventilation, lactate, etc. increases serotonin."

I think it's serotonin that directly increases parathyroid hormone, and then parathyroid hormone increases nitric oxide.

So the heat shock proteins are just happening under all of that. Is that right? Or is it more of a secondary messenger type of situation?

Yeah. There are so many of these pathways towards death. Each pathway gives you mental confirmation, but the fact is they're all happening at the same time because it isn't being run by a cascade of signals acting on receptors.

It's the phase change that's happening.

Like a phase change of the entire organism mediated by each cell?

Mm-hmm.

And that coacervate, that's like a mini cancer? The cell is no longer a whole and it's kind of dividing up into subgroups? Is that the way you see it?

It's part of normal adaptation for the cytoplasm to differentiate according to challenge.

But when the de-energizing is extreme, you get things like the prions forms that can start real degeneration, cancer, and dementia, and so on.

But ordinarily, any little pressure can cause the quality of the coacervate to change accordingly and usefully.

And that's what's happening when bacteria do the reorganization of their genes. It isn't that they have a messenger service that has the address of the genes that they send in after having computed which gene they need to meet the environmental stress.

But it's that the whole system is such that the genetic resources are always in touch with the problem situation.

And so the phase change occurs according to a schedule of real-world probability.

And those small perturbations are really like the organism's holistic way of doing calculations.

And during that process, the cell would be especially susceptible to vaccine or viral RNA, polyethylene glycol, carrageenan, etc.?

Yeah, the fatigued state is a degree of the inflamed state. And one of the deranged things related to the genetic causation doctrine is the idea of the cell surface membrane as being a barrier.

But if you think of it being nothing but the end of the coacervate of the cell and the beginning of the extracellular world,

the state of energy of the coacervate or the degree of water protein solubility of the cell as a whole,

the barrier function on the microscopic level that Gilbert Lane talks about, it's a phase governed selectivity, not a poor governed.

The idea that you can let in a small, moderately water-free potassium ions to the energized cell and exclude the hydrated, bigger sodium ions,

that's the idea that there is a barrier. But the drug companies have taken advantage of that and convinced researchers to get certain drugs or big molecules in the cells.

They need to buy a certain delivery or targeting molecule like the vaccine, the current RNA vaccine has lipids that are actually functioning as inflammation promoting adjuvants.

But they're being advertised as delivery agents for the nucleic acid as supposedly the strip of RNA is so big it can't get across the barrier membrane unless it's enclosed in these targeting specific lipids.

But when one group of researchers was genetically modifying cells, they would buy the targeting agent and put their stretch of a big DNA molecule into this targeting lipid.

And as a control for how successful the genetic change was taking up the targeted DNA, they introduced bare naked stretches of the same DNA.

And they found they went into cells even easier than the targeted piece of DNA. The cells, ordinary cells can take up or dissolve DNA from the environment.

So what you eat, a certain amount of the DNA is getting into your lymphatic and blood circulation and cells have the option of taking up whole genetic stretches of information.

If the cell judges it, it can be helpful. So the idea of the cell state, the inflammatory state, it's really the cell that is already stressed, de-energized, and inflamed is an obvious target for a virus.

The virus doesn't have to necessarily have clever attaching machinery and enzymes. It can just fall into a weakened cell just because the cell is relatively water soluble.

You've described that before as just a general leakiness, correct?

Yeah.

And in your newsletter you say the drug companies are creating a variety of heat shock protein inhibitors and you said that also before.

But I imagine minocycline or the tetracyclines in general and progesterone, those are drugs that already exist that probably do that, right?

Yeah.

Medellin blue is also another extremely potent one specifically for heat shock protein 70.

Thanks for that, Georgie. Ray, I don't know how related this question is, but the idea of incorporating things like milk and cheese and vitamin D and vitamin K to lower parathyroid hormone, do you see that as a newer part of the system and thus suppressing it can help turn off a lot of these older aspects of the system like the prolactin, the serotonin, etc.?

Well, there are different layers and probably most important to an organism with a big skeleton, but I think analogs of parathyroid hormone go way back in the different evolutionary levels.

I don't remember where it starts, but I think it's something analogous is a very early part of the systems.

But the parathyroid glands being, I mean, you correct me, but in such close proximity to the thyroid, did that mean they evolved at the same time?

Not necessarily, but probably. They have very contrary functions and so maybe it's like being close so they know what each other is doing.

And then a similar question, but the renin-angiotensin system, is that even more ancient than our hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis?

I think it is. Those are things you can look up. The phylogeny of hormones. A lot of people have seen how far back you can find the molecule.

Great stuff. I was going to do an advertisement. Georgie, unless you have some questions?

No, keep going.

Okay, so we jumped right into it, but I just wanted to say that we are reading from Ray Peat's newsletter. And so Ray, can you just let everybody know how they can obtain your newsletter?

Oh, raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. They can give you information. It's $28 for 12 issues over two years.

And then the same situation for your books. So you can email that same address. When you looked at these prices, were those right for the digital copies?

No, I think it's much lower for the digital. I don't remember how much it is.

That's what I thought. So you can get Ray's books in a digital format. And then I wanted to talk about Progest-E from Keenogen.

And so this is the Progestrone I've been using for a long, long time. I email Catherine at Keenogen@gmail.com.

And Ray, you had mentioned to other people that you thought you were confident in this product. Is there anything you want to say about it?

Oh, I've used it for 45 years or so myself after researching it in animals. But I finally got interested in how people could use it.

And so I experimented with what the safe and effective solvents were. And that was how I came up with the Progest-E complex formula in the 1970s.

And I tried it out on all my friends and pets and such. Like roommates, a pet rabbit had a brain tumor and had reached the point that it couldn't hop, couldn't stay standing up if it tried to hop.

And when I was blind, the vet had said it was beyond help, couldn't even do its basic functions.

And so my friend said, "Okay, try your Progesterone." And I rubbed the oily solution on the relatively bare skin inside both of its ears.

So it was really a huge dose because of the size of the ears. And I had tried setting it up and previously it had just fallen over.

This time it fell over and went into a deep sleep. I came back two or three hours later and my friend thought I had killed the rabbit. It was so stretched out and relaxed.

But when I approached it, it leaped to its feet like a new rabbit. And the first thing it did was to hop straight ahead and came to a wall and stopped and copiously urinated.

And apparently it was unloading some large amount of water that had been causing swelling and pressure and so on.

And after that it could hop and do everything rabbits normally do, turn corners quickly and so on.

I have a picture, I think it's from Hans Selye's 1947 textbook of endocrinology. Was that the name of it?

Anyways, it's the one that you talked about where the guy has the rat and he's picked it up and he thinks it's dead.

But it's just really, really, really relaxed. And so exactly what you said about the rabbit.

Yeah, it looks like a wet dish right now.

Yeah, exactly.

I have a question. Why would progesterone be able to fill in for the function of the adrenal glands that were removed but pregnenolone wouldn't?

I think Selye's experiment showed that maybe about 20% of the rats would survive if you give them pregnenolone compared to like 100% if you inject them with cortisone and maybe 80% if you inject them with progesterone.

But pregnenolone didn't have that adrenocortical effect.

Yeah, Hans Selye showed that each of the steroids has a range of properties.

And aldosterone has its estrogen resembling and anti-androgenic properties. Each one has a range. And it just turns out that progesterone will fill in for a deficiency of aldosterone or cortisol or androgen.

But it will also protect against an excess toxic dose of those same things because it has a weak mineralocorticoid effect that makes up for the absence of aldosterone as well as toxic excess.

And the same thing, testosterone has progesterone sustaining pregnancy sustaining effects if you give it to a pregnant animal.

But it's not nearly as effective at that purpose as progesterone is. And the estrogen is the thing that it's strictly antagonistic to.

It will have some of the anti-inflammatory properties of cortisol as well as being a major protector against excess cortisol poisoning.

And it does a lot of those things on the enzyme level as well as the so-called receptor level.

When you look at the list of its actions, coordinated effects on both receptors of all sorts and enzyme activation changes, you would think it was a magical invention.

It's so extremely complex but organized.

And I mean judging from the studies, the few studies that have been done on pregnenolone in comparison to progesterone, the pregnenolone seems to have more of a structure stabilizing effect, not so much hormonal effect. Is that right?

Yeah, I think that's true of both pregnenolone and progesterone.

I don't think of either of them as a hormone. And the FDA, at least for 50 years, classified pregnenolone as a non-hormonal steroid.

I include progesterone in that category, non-hormonal, because when you look at everything it's doing, it's stabilizing the energy and structural systems.

Stabilization is so different from hormonal excitation and activation. It just doesn't fit the word.

So maybe we should classify the steroids into pro- and anti-metabolic lipids, right? Because they are lipids after all.

Yeah.

I want to talk about androgens actually, but one last question about progesterone. If somebody has a very sensitive stomach but they want to take it orally, have there been any ways that you've found that can get a person around that and maybe not irritate them?

Yeah, a large amount of vitamin E taken orally. If you have a sensitive gallbladder or something, that sticky oil creates nausea, gagging, all kinds of digestive reactions.

But if you mix it with butter, for example, and take it with a baked potato or some food, you don't even notice it.

Good stuff. Okay, so Georgie and I, the last two weeks, have been talking about DHT.

And then somebody emailed me and left a few comments saying we were taking you out of context. And so I had to go back and listen to some of our previous conversations.

And there was one that I never really listened to again because the audio quality was so bad. But you were explicitly clear, Ray, in your thoughts about DHT.

And I won't read the whole quote, but it's like, in general, things like that are not to be messed with unless you have a very specific knowledge of a deficiency because if you take a little too much, any of those defining feature-creating hormones can change the whole system in an unpredictable way.

Yeah, everything you do practically changes a million things about the organism. And the known effects, if someone is dying of cancer, obviously you don't worry about what it's going to do to their sex life in five years.

So again, just your general thoughts and your experience. I talked to a lot of guys, obviously, that have taken finasteride and feel like they're really never going to be the same again.

And then also I talked to a lot of people with gynecomastia. And so again, given that they're exploring thyroid, vitamin D, good nutrition, bowel disinfectants and things, where do you think either testosterone or DHT can play a helpful role?

If you see the problem as energy depletion and inflammation, that sort of change, then you will take into account thyroid, carbon dioxide, glucose, the balance of amino acids in your proteins,

cutting proteins that contain methionine, cysteine and tryptophan, supplementing instead some gelatin, all of the anti-inflammatory things and aspirin, coffee or caffeine and progesterone are very effective stabilizing,

energy restoring, anti-inflammatory things that help all of those. But I think it's important to think of those as a deviation from the proper functions of the organism and look to restoring the energized,

uninflamed but purposeful processes of the organism. And a lot of that is getting your attention away from the medicalization.

People can get so interested in that particular problem, the finasteride syndrome or post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, that they forget what it is they're doing in their life.

And if they can get the sense of excitement and play as a governing principle of their activities and start imagining the constructive anti-inflammatory energy restoring things,

rather than trying to work out the thousands of details of what particular substance would be most effective.

So you're saying that since the ceiling on even something like coffee or aspirin or other anti-inflammatory therapies in a person's life, like a person could find, it could take a long time to find the right dose of aspirin, you know, and that should be explored before trying something testosterone or DHT?

Oh, yeah, but in conjunction with adequate sugar and the right protein and mixed nutrition and feeling out the effects of what the aspirin is doing,

because those hormonal effects are leaving the estrogen excitatory process in your brain, for example, to dominate and that tends to create an obsessive process in the brain where the others,

when you lose interest in your particular health problem, you're probably on the right track.

I guess one question for me, if a male were to use any of the endpoint androgens, let's say they have a severe deficiency of androgens and they tried to correct it, they couldn't.

And if they're at the point of using, let's say, testosterone, my question is, wouldn't it be less risky to use the DHT given its non-ability to turn into estrogen?

Yeah, definitely. You know, there are clinics going up around the country selling testosterone treatments and the doses they give are ridiculous.

Fifty or a hundred milligrams at a time, for example, where a healthy young male makes maybe four or five milligrams a day and maybe 10 or 15 milligrams of DHEA per day.

If you take, for example, one milligram of DHT and back it up with a few milligrams of DHEA and progesterone, aspirin, coffee, steady supply of sugar and related nutrients,

then the DHT is more likely to have a constructive repairing role.

Well, I will let the cat out of the bag a little bit. So I've been experimenting a little bit with DHT and I would say, and I'm not above the idea that it could be harmful in the long run,

but it definitely seems to have a neutralizing effect on the nervous system. And so would…

Yeah, anti-inflammatory is what it's doing beneficially.

In my experience, nothing terminates a severe stress reaction for me like a few milligrams of DHT.

But my experience is that it's not something that can be used on an ongoing basis without interruption.

It's more like the emergency fix when you're really in trouble and you don't feel like taking three grams of aspirin or you don't have them with you.

The DHT works in minutes like a charm.

But, Ray, I definitely don't want to mischaracterize. You're saying there's a hundred other things to check before doing that, right?

Yeah, just because it makes you feel so good that you're going to get stuck on that if you don't fix the whole energy system that started the whole process.

Yeah, that's definitely in the back of my brain that there's something else that needs correction.

So speaking of aspirin, something I was interested in, what do you consider a max dose of aspirin at a single time?

For example, I know when I've tried a gram or two grams, it seems to have a hypoglycemic effect after a while.

So is there an amount that you feel comfortable with taking at one time?

I have taken as much as a gram, but you have to be familiar with it.

I think usually 300 to 500 milligrams at a time with food is safe and comfortable.

And you can repeat that amount usually very safely.

Good stuff, Georgie. Interrupt me at any time. I was just going to go through these questions.

And then, you know, we have a bunch of reader questions, too, so we can go into them.

I just wanted to expand on the hypoglycemic effect. In higher doses, aspirin depletes the amino acid L-carnitine and starts to work very similarly to the drug meldonium.

So if you take more than, I don't know, I guess it depends for each person, but I think over a gram or two grams,

it basically inhibits significantly the oxidation of fat to cause a drop in blood sugar.

So I would certainly take it with something sweet if you're taking higher doses.

Yeah, that sounds good. Great stuff.

OK, so a few days ago I posted on my Instagram about mushrooms and then I was instantly I got a lot of questions about agaritine and I couldn't answer them.

So I thought I might ask you. But anyways, what exactly is happening to the agaritine?

Because maybe in an older email from a few years ago, you sent somebody something that said it was like changed from not being harmful to maybe being helpful.

But it's entirely possible that I misinterpreted what you said to him.

No, I don't remember what I said.

But OK, so when you're cooking the mushrooms for three hours, are you getting rid of the agaritine like it's escaping in the cooking process?

Yeah, either it's turned into something very different or just vaporizes.

And then a lot of people, and again, I know you've talked about this already, but the water doesn't contain the agaritine after a few hours.

No.

OK.

Looking at the structure, it looks like it will be highly estrogenic, that agaritine thing.

Have you seen something on that, Ray, if it has any estrogenic effects aside from being labeled as a carcinogen?

No, no, I haven't.

And speaking of fungus, Ray, is there any way to distinguish between a fungal and bacterial infection?

Because from what I've read, they seem extremely similar.

Fungus is a nucleated cell that works so much like a human cell that the poisons they have for treating them happen to knock out our own mitochondria,

because they're generally intended to knock out the fungus mitochondrion energy system.

And so the people who are convinced they have systemic fungal infection will take those toxic drugs for a long time and get worse and worse

and think it's the fungus that's responsible and it's really the drug knocking out their mitochondria.

And bacterial infections, if they reach your bloodstream, they can quickly become deadly,

and a good strong dose of antibiotics gets into your bloodstream and will take care of systemic bacterial infection.

But once a fungus actually gets in your bloodstream, I think a person might have something like a week to live

because there are no really effective safe drugs once you have an actual systemic fungal infection.

It can linger in your lungs but not getting in your bloodstream, so it can damage the lungs over a period of years.

But if it was actually a systemic infection, like many people are told that Candida does,

but that's all just selling treatment that goes on forever.

What would be some signs/symptoms of having a, starting to develop a systemic fungal infection?

Oh, extreme sickness. It grows so fast because it has everything it needs in the blood

and there's no good immune defense once it gets in the bloodstream.

People with a very weak immune system can live for years with it thriving in their small intestine and even stomach

so that yeast can grow high enough up that you can make alcohol when you eat carbohydrate

because the yeast will ferment it right in your stomach and small intestine, but that isn't reaching the bloodstream.

So for people with this intestinally bound fungal infection, what is it that they can do?

I mean, should they be taking the drug or are there nutritive options?

One thing is not to starve the yeast because if you know what happens if you've baked bread,

when the yeast runs out of sugar from breaking down starch, it starts attacking the proteins

and you get a very stinky batch of dough.

And that same thing happens that the yeast that starved for sugar changes radically

and becomes very invasive and toxic and destructive.

So not taking the very popular no sugar diet approach, fiber to accelerate your intestine,

accelerate to improve the acid production and enzyme production and peristalsis stimulated by fiber in the diet

will increase the resistance to the growth of the fungus and should eventually over a period of several days

clean out and disinfect your small intestine.

What about things like coconut oil?

Yeah, the oils, coconut or olive oil are both bacteria killing and fungicide.

And some people have used olive oil doses for H. pylori in their stomach, for example,

but it also helps to suppress it in the small intestine.

That's the idea of having a little bit of it with shredded carrot.

The carrot itself has some antifungal ingredients and combined with a touch of vinegar and olive oil,

it's disinfecting your intestine while stimulating it.

Is there any specific fatty acid in olive oil that's responsible for this

or some of the other components that are present in the actual olive fruit?

All of the saturated fatty acids are fairly germicidal.

I just forgot what I was going to say.

I was going to ask you about the olive oil, but you think, would you like prefer that over coconut oil for kind of a disinfectant effect, right?

I think I would.

And so even with the daily keeping the PUFA as low as possible, it would be worth it to find a very pure olive oil to use every day,

maybe on the mushrooms or the carrot?

Yeah, and it tastes the best too.

The FDA or Department of Agriculture years ago did a survey and found,

I think it was 70% of the olive oil sold in the US was fraudulent, contaminated with canola or some other oil.

How much olive oil are we talking here? Like a fourth of a teaspoon or something?

Oh, yeah, half a teaspoon is okay. It just gives you a trace of PUFA.

The question I forgot was, from what I gather from what you're saying, is that a fungal infection is going to be a lot more rare than just a bacterial infection. Is that right?

Yeah. Once it gets into your tissues like the lungs or the skin or toenails,

it's very hard to get rid of because it's so closely structurally and functionally similar to human cells.

And then one last question, then we can move on to reader or viewer questions.

I have one related as well.

Go ahead.

You mentioned H. pylori. That's pretty common in low thyroid people.

And so in addition to the vitamin D and getting in the carrot salad or the mushrooms,

I think maybe you specifically identified tetracycline and a, maybe you said a macrolide and a penicillin.

You thought that was kind of a useful therapy for that?

All of those have been tried and proven effective.

For like two or three weeks, not just taking it for a few days?

Yeah, just to be sure.

And then a question, I'm sorry, the question I get all the time is like in, I had gathered a bunch of your responses of how you used antibiotics yourself.

And so you had mentioned, oh, in the past, I'd use it for a day or two until the symptom was gone.

But if somebody has like an outright infection, that might not be long enough to get rid of the infection.

If you are watching the symptoms of the infection, the first dose you take, like 250 milligrams of penicillin,

you might not feel anything. Take another dose four hours later.

And at some point, a second or third dose, you usually feel a sudden subsiding of the symptoms.

And with the third or fourth dose, the symptoms of the infection are often gone.

But I think it's a good idea to taper off, take them maybe at eight hours interval for the next day or so.

Sorry to interrupt, go ahead.

Just making sure that the symptoms are noticeably subsiding and then disappearing and that they don't come back.

Like chronic gas or diarrhea or things like that, that would be more of a serious type of that.

A person could guess they probably had something worse than just a mild endotoxin problem or something like that.

Yeah. If it's a fungus producing gas, the penicillin isn't going to do much.

And flowers of sulfur and fibers and thyroid are the way to get your digestive system active.

The flowers of sulfur are turned by fungus.

They have exoenzymes that act to reduce the sulfane form of the sulfur producing hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to them.

So they produce their own toxic form of sulfur, but it's local.

And you might for a few hours, you might smell like hydrogen sulfide if you have a lot of fungus.

But that's what's killing the fungus.

And so it's a very safe way to get rid of intestinal fungus.

A couple of questions in regards to antibiotics.

As you know, Ray, most doctors, if they put you on antibiotics, they'll say you have to take it for two weeks or ten days or two weeks.

Usually it's about two weeks.

Is there any good evidence behind the recommendation or is it purely ideological?

A few studies found that the infection could linger and that there would be spores that if you stopped it after four or five days, whenever the symptoms were gone, the spores could germinate after ten days or so.

And so what they're doing is killing the second infection with the first prescription.

They're just taking account of the possibilities of the spore being a return of the infection.

Okay, and related to that, antibiotic resistance, which has been blown out of proportion in my opinion.

It's a huge topic right now.

Everybody's working on the latest and greatest, newest antibiotic.

How much truth do you think there is to that, that if you use an antibiotic repeatedly, the bacteria will become resistant to it and it will no longer be effective?

On a population basis, that happens.

That's where the resistant bacteria come from.

Hospitals do it so consistently they breed their own toxic resistant strain.

But one person, it just doesn't happen.

And then what about the claims that if you use antibiotics, even sporadically but continuously, you will eventually give yourself a fungal overgrowth because the fungus is opportunistic and when you kill off the bacteria, the fungus will take over.

Is there any truth to that?

Yeah, that famously happens with the heavy two-week program that's so commonly prescribed.

They can really sterilize your intestine, but without paying attention to your hormones that govern the digestive enzymes, a sterile intestine, which isn't digesting properly, is a good place for fungus to take root.

So you want to make sure if you really sterilize your intestine that you're taking into account the things that will restore secretion of stomach acid, pancreatic enzymes, and mucous production, everything that takes energy to produce.

So would it be a good idea then if somebody's using antibiotics just to throw in a bit of flowers of sulfur just in case, just not to give the fungus the opportunity to immediately overgrow?

If they're going to take such a gigantic dose as doctors usually prescribe.

Okay. And then specifically to the tetracycline family of antibiotics, all of these molecules are quinones and all quinones have antifungal effect as well.

Would those be – do you think that may be true of the tetracyclines? I'm just going by –

Yeah, I think it's even used in trees and such for fungal infections. And at the same time, it's anti-inflammatory and inflammation predisposes to all kinds of infection.

And so the tetracyclines, I think their major effect might be the anti-inflammation.

The medical world reacted to the suggestion that azithromycin was part of the proper treatment for the COVID virus because they saw it as a bacteria killer, not a virus killer.

But its anti-inflammatory effect is very powerful at knocking out the symptoms of the virus infection.

And by knocking out the symptoms of inflammation, that in itself creates a resistance to the virus getting into your cells.

Okay. And again, another question specific to the tetracyclines. Is there anything inherently irritating in those molecules that can irritate the intestinal tract for some people?

Because I know some people react really badly to specifically those type of antibiotics.

Yeah, any reaction that you have, you should stop taking that one.

Okay. And specifically for minocycline, I think you mentioned to Danny once that it may inhibit the thyroid via what mechanism?

I'm not sure, but lots of people get very uncomfortable on just a moderate dose of minocycline, even though it's theoretically very good and is being used to treat dementia and so on because of its anti-inflammatory effects.

But some people just have to be very watchful that it doesn't do something they don't like.

Can you go into that a little bit more because I feel like I've definitely experienced that.

I don't know what causes it exactly, but I've had bad reactions to different antibiotics that it could have just been a batch effect or it could be a peculiarity of my system.

I don't know of any studies that explain why people have those bad reactions.

This is kind of related, but sometimes when I would take like 50 milligrams of minocycline or something, I'd feel profoundly – I think Georgie just said this – but I feel like I was hypothyroid.

It made me hypothyroid, but it would also mitigate a stomach problem.

And so I would hypothesize like, "Oh, maybe it lowered nitric oxide or it lowered some stress hormone or something that was keeping my structure together and lowering it made me kind of look ugly while also actually lowering the inflammation in my intestine."

Does that make any sense at all?

Yeah. By reducing inflammation, sometimes your stress hormones will come back to normal.

And if you're experiencing good functioning from abnormally high adrenaline and cortisol, when those are lowered by getting rid of the inflammation, then you feel a letdown and realize you're compensating for something like hypothyroidism by running high on adrenaline.

Not that you guys necessarily care. I think our stream is down, but I'm still recording the audio.

And so we just have to keep rolling. I don't know what is going on because the stream health is good.

It's just like the whole thing is glitchy, and people are saying we're cutting in and out, but honestly, it doesn't matter because I'm still recording it.

So Georgie, did you have anything else on this topic?

No, I got those all.

Okay. Thank you, Ray. Thank you, Georgie. Let's try playing a question because I'm just going to assume this is still going. Solomon had one about testosterone. We kind of covered that. This one from John is about... I'll leave it as a surprise. Okay. So let me hide this. Ray, you can hear everything okay still?

Yeah.

Okay. Let me hide this. Okay. This one's from John.

Hey, Danny.

Oh, this is not going to work. Okay. That was real glitchy.

Choppy.

Yeah. Okay. Error. YouTube is not receiving enough video. This makes no sense. Okay. Let's try one more and see what happens. This one's from our brother Ozan. Ozan.

Hello, Danny. Hello, Georgie. Hello, Dr. Peat. This is Ozan. My question is about viruses. After investigating them over the past year a little deeper, like most people, I can't really see a reason why a virus would even want to invade a human cell, especially because wanting seems like something a living organism would do.

So if a virus isn't alive, it seems as though we're attributing ideas to an inanimate object. I'm kind of having a hard time seeing the advantages of a virus to inhabit a cell and duplicate itself, because then we're implicating that it has the processes that are involved in making those type of decisions, like a metabolism or energy production or digestion or reproduction.

And it doesn't seem to have any of those things. It more so seems like an RFID chip that a higher intelligence made and is then enabled by another higher organism than itself, akin to exosomes being produced by our cells.

Viruses, to me, at least, seem that way, as opposed to what they're being propagated as, which is something that can have malicious intent, even though they're in quantities that are incomprehensible. There's so many viruses.

So maybe Dr. Peat could expand upon this idea that viruses want to get into your cells as if they're a parasite and you're the host, because I'm just not really seeing that relationship.

If anything, it seems akin to horizontal gene transfer, where there's a transfer of information happening between organisms. And I remember Dr. Peat being able to take up DNA, even if it's foreign.

The exosomes are produced by our own cells under stress, and sometimes they can create a stress or defect in other cells. But normally their function is to repair and patch up and quit the processes that are causing the problem.

So the exosomes normally are part of our maintenance system, and when our system is sick, then the exosomes can extend and spread that sickness.

But the environment is full of cells that have decomposed for various reasons, or pollen that's deliberately spread by plants.

We inhale pollen or eat it, and that DNA gets into our system, and our cells have access to that and now and then can absorb it.

People who've eaten certain kinds of algae, for example, it turns out that the algae DNA can be found in their own cells, in the human brain cells, for example.

And a few labs that have looked for those effects find that it isn't that uncommon.

I think it's the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, part of MIT-Harvard, a group there, did a study on the RNA virus used in the vaccine.

And on human cells in vitro, they showed that cells not only can take it up and use it in the cytoplasm, but their reverse transcriptases can integrate it into the DNA genome.

And if you question how these complex systems, large stretches of DNA or RNA surrounded by proteins and lipids, how the virus came into existence,

naturally a higher intelligence was responsible. Animals and plants, with their repair systems, are always packaging some of their DNA, RNA, and proteins into exosomes for their own maintenance.

And if these get into the environment, probably as food of other organisms as well as things drifting in the air like pollen,

but this horizontal transfer of genetic information, bacteria do it as a routine thing. They mutate in the right direction and make a little exosome to transmit that DNA to not only their same species, but even different species.

So they're usefully and protectively doing a DNA transfer, which is like passing a good virus or a good exosome onto its neighbors.

And I don't see any possible origin for viruses other than as escaped genetic material from complex organisms, animals and plants.

And plant organisms, plant viruses, can be taken up like the algae DNA that was found in people who had eaten it.

Two plant genetics professors at Oregon State who were working with a plant virus to infect the plant, they would put some pumice powder on their finger and the dab of the virus culture,

and then they would rub the plant leaves. The pumice was to break the cuticle and let the virus get into the plant.

These two professors working with the same plant virus just a few months apart both died of a very rare brain disease, which I think very likely was similar to the algae gene that can affect the brain.

I think these were an example of grinding plant virus DNA into their fingers and having the brain cells take it up with harmful effect.

I have a question here related to that. So I guess in that case it doesn't make sense to speak of like an avian specific virus or a marine specific virus or a human specific virus.

They're all viruses of specific origin, but as far as their target, it's really any organism that can make use of them. Is that correct?

I think so. Or that it is in especially weakened condition so that any random junk falls into their cells.

Okay. So potentially, would you guess like what portion of these viruses that are out there would be harmful to us or would it be anything would be harmful, even beneficial ones, if we're in an energetically depleted state?

Yeah, it would be the fairly rare virus that would be really useful without a lot of work.

But I think our cells can store some of these as potentially useful, even though they might have to undergo further stress to mutate it enough to make use of it.

But generally, I think being in the depleted, inflamed state makes us susceptible to probably 99% of the DNA we incorporate in that condition is going to be harmful to some extent.

Well, that raises a very interesting question about the origin of viral pandemics. Why would they suddenly start for a specific virus and then let's say like spread around the entire world?

Either there's no such thing or maybe, or I don't know, like why would a specific virus suddenly take hold into humans considering they've been exposed to those viruses probably for generations, but suddenly we have this pandemic and now it's taking over the world?

Well, probably not.

Not the specific one, but pandemics in general, to me, sound either not possible and they're being overblown or there's something else going on.

Yeah, the coronavirus has been around as long as anyone knows, causing colds and several lawyers are suing state and federal departments of health, asking them for the information of the harmfulness that they based their lockdown and vaccine campaign on.

They have not released any actual data to support the whole pandemic response system. It's a big vacuum as far as actual science is concerned.

Right, but aside from this pandemic, I mean I'm looking at the 1918 flu pandemic, a study recently came out, even the Black Death, the plague, the study recently came out that said both of these events, the mass deaths were actually due to possibly endotoxin overload, stress and like general inflammation, not the actual virus itself.

So the whole talk about pandemics sounds very political to me, even if the virus is pathological.

Yeah, but that's the thing about the azithromycin, for example, or hydroxychloroquine, any of the things that have obvious helpful effects.

Aspirin, progesterone, everything that is helpful is anti-inflammatory. As if the, what am I looking for, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.

Oh, azithromycin, yes.

It has a profoundly anti-inflammatory effect. Those things are actually not only preventing and curing the symptoms, but they're putting the cell into the uninflamed condition that makes young healthy people resistant to even catching the virus or having any reaction to it.

The system doesn't want to relieve the suffering and death whatever is causing it, whether it's influenza or COVID virus.

They want to sell their vaccine primarily and possibly a new patented antiviral, but they're turning away from the very clear evidence of extreme success in treating and curing and preventing the symptoms just by concentrating on the inflammation.

It's only the inflammation that is killing people and causing symptoms. Inflammation leads to the uptake and replication of the virus.

So, if I'm hearing this correctly, blaming solely a virus for a worldwide pandemic, whatever that virus may be, is insane.

Yeah, because this inflammation always causes damage to the intestine. These are enteroviruses.

They infect the intestine preferentially. When the intestine is inflamed, it leaks at least endotoxin and increases serotonin release.

Those both increase clotting and inflammation of the blood vessels, which are currently being emphasized as a major killing effect.

All of these clotting, inflammatory blood vessels, brain, lung, multi-system problems have existed before and are not specific for this disease.

If they, tomorrow, on every newscast around America, if they announced that the Rottie virus was out and that it was terribly dangerous and gave a bunch of ambiguous symptoms, wouldn't that create a similar type of situation?

A bunch of people going to the hospital and getting iatrogenic treatment? That's something that isn't seeded into the culture of understanding.

Just using something like fear could create a mass amount of illness.

Yeah, and then putting a tube in someone's windpipe and pumping air into them. That destroys the lungs very quickly. The hospitals were ordered to do that with no rational basis whatsoever.

They killed just by intubating that many people. Whatever they had as a problem, you're going to kill a very high percentage of them.

Like the German hospitals, a doctor who insisted on the rational, traditional, mild way of giving oxygen with just a cannula at your nostril.

His hospital had zero COVID deaths and an adjoining hospital just as technically qualified, but following the unfounded recommendations, they had 60% mortality.

Absolute murder by intubation. In general, when you order people to diagnose and treat in certain ways, you're going to create the appearance of a very deadly disease, which is really the side effects of medicalization.

You mentioned there's a factor in the environment that's leading to this general frailty of the population, especially the young people. It's probably more than one, right? Or do you have one that specifically you have in mind?

Oh, yeah. All sorts of things. The last 40 years have tremendously increased in the environment. The use of polyunsaturated fats is one anti-energy exposure.

The use of nanoparticles in foods and clothing, for example, and skin preparations are another major change tending to promote inflammation.

And then vaccinations are intended. The aluminum or lipid adjuvant is put in there to create systemic inflammation.

And experimentally, you can create allergies in an animal by exposing them in that way. And injecting antigens into the muscle is completely irrational as far as our immune functioning works.

But it reaches the nerves transport the inflammation producing substance to the brain and the brain activates a system wide inflammatory state, which, among other things, increases production of antibodies.

But at the same time, it's depleting your general resistance. And the vaccine increase corresponds very closely to the rise of allergies and inflammatory diseases like autoimmune.

But I think it also is behind this accumulation, Kawasaki disease being very rare and things being added to a systemic inflammatory syndrome, which is reaching its peak now.

So presumably all these factors also activate the heat shock proteins, right?

Yeah.

Okay, we can segue into these last bit of questions and then we'll let you go, right? So one, thank you so much for joining us. The stream has totally gone belly up. We're just audio now. And some people are saying they can't hear us. But anyways, we're just going to keep going.

Okay, so I actually, we got, I received lots of angry emails about our last conversation and I sent out, please give us like criticism or constructive criticism on things that we got wrong, whether it had to do with the last conversation or other conversations.

And I received approximately zero critical questions. And so I was going to-

But people kept complaining, right?

People were complaining, but nobody was offering to clarify our warped wrong views. And so I found that to be interesting. So, but this is a open-minded discussion here. And so if you're offended easily, you might not want to listen to this. I don't know why that would be, but whatever.

So my question to you that we were talking about a little bit before the stream started, like if a group of people has a problematic kind of death culture, holy book that overrides our innate solidarity with other humans, animals, et cetera, how can a functioning society be formed or maintain, be maintained rather?

I think it would probably be best to start with everything people can do that is not guided by that death culture.

Just looking at the practical outcome of what you're doing and gradually, if you can shift your attention to the practical moment,

then the ideal thing would be to shift your attention to improving not just the practice of things, but our understanding that makes practical living and problem solving possible.

Overcoming death and death's variations by discovering the cause of death and its variations and developing curiosity as well as practicality.

And the curiosity is I think the pro-life essence of living behavior, including animals and bacteria.

So I might not fully understand, but if somebody is healthy, this is going to be very controversial, if somebody is healthy, do you think they'd take a more liberal stance on what a holy book would say, like not take it so literally?

Oh yeah, that has been a historical trend to treat those ideas as metaphors and not follow rules slavishly.

And then those--

Like not cutting out people's eyes or cutting off their hands as punishment.

Some of the literal things advocated in holy books are now recognized as barbarians, even though some countries still apply them.

Georgie, interrupt whenever. Okay, so and then a functioning healthy society would be resistant even if there was a faction of people that were fanatical about their specific book, is that right?

Yeah, people who want to survive and improve their lives can just go on about their business.

Could you build a society around kind of this moral holistic – because people often make that argument, you have to have something like the Bible or whatever to build on top of.

Do you think you could build on top of a holistic view of science and have it be, I don't know, functional?

Yeah, you can find like Wilhelm Reich in his book The Murder of Christ made great use of one of the books of the New Testament to connect his thinking with what's in the Christian Bible.

It was very convincing use of those old ideas in a life-affirming way.

Georgie, cut me off anytime here. What do you see as the artificial – and we've probably talked about this before – but what do you see as the artificial long-term struggle between humans? Would you classify it as authoritarian versus anti-authoritarian, or would you get more specific with it, or how would you view it?

Mostly it's authoritarian versus authoritarian. Behind authoritarianism is a doctrine of atomistic individualism that sort of defines everyone else as a potential enemy.

And starting with – it could come from ideas in the Christian culture.

Marx, for example, adopted largely Christian ethics in designing his new approach to reality. But you can find lots of good ideas in our tradition. You don't have to start from a vacuum.

And then authoritarian versus – we talked a long time ago about kind of connecting everything to nature. Would that have any relationship to nature, like categorizing in authoritarian versus anti-authoritarian, or how you said authoritarian versus authoritarian? Or it's totally for this human construct type of thing?

Yeah, the authoritarians have placed themselves, the individual human, against nature. And so they refuse to see intelligence. It starts with denying full human qualities to women and children because it's only the male patriarch that is truly fully human.

And then that extends – animals are material, not living intelligent beings. And obviously the same for plants and microbes.

They are defined as a material world, and women and children are mired in the material world to some extent.

And so getting away from that idea of a material world is an essential thing. You can't objectify it and say it's life.

Life is the dominant male, and all the rest is tending to be inert and unwholesome matter.

If you see the consciousness that is visible in plants, animals, and bacteria all the way down to their smallest units,

the coacervation approach is just one way of seeing that every atom and molecule has an actual active role.

There's no random junk operating anywhere in the system. Everything is participating and guided by intelligence, except when authoritarian beliefs intervene to become blind to the intelligence that's there.

I have a question. You said in one of the previous podcasts that at least the way you experienced it, the country kind of peaked in the 1950s.

You said we had everything that we needed, and after that things steadily got worse.

But my question is this authoritarianism has been around for millennia, and it certainly existed back in the 1950s.

Some of the more conservative groups these days are trying to make the argument that this country peaked precisely when it was controlled and ran by a patriarchal, waspy society.

How do you respond to people like that?

J.D. Unwin was a professor in England who said that the repressive authoritarian society was necessary for civilization itself.

He said that the nature of the world is that it needs the authoritarian dictator to keep the material degeneration process from happening where everyone would just enjoy what they're doing.

It has to be organized so it has good armies and can conquer the world and expand as an empire.

That was in the 1930s. He was writing about the process of creating an ideology of repression.

It began at the beginning of the century with neo-Darwinism, and then people like J.D. Unwin and Konrad Lorenz in Germany, Charles Davenport, the eugenics professor in the U.S.

Those were primarily subsidized by the big corporations and banks.

It was after the Second World War that they really got organized when the CIA became the primary agent of these corporations and banks which had been doing it on a private basis, taking over governments by their own private armies.

But the CIA now got things organized and made a program to take over the media, the universities, the publishing houses, and set the world on the strictly authoritarian course.

So these things have been there all along, but first the corporations establishing relative monopolies, and then the CIA acting as the agent of monopolies.

It was a given a power that became sort of totalitarian. I did it from 1950 because that's when the CIA started the Congress for Cultural Freedom,

which even abstract expressionism was promoted in the art world over any kind of meaningful image, painting, or sculpture.

It was totalitarian in the sense that it penetrated religious publications, art museums, concerts, everything in the culture was being redesigned under the guidance of the CIA.

So do you think technology has a natural proclivity to eventually degenerate and become a tool in the authoritarian hand to oppress everybody?

Norbert Wiener, who was one of the most important people in designing our artificial intelligence and control and communication system, he immediately at the end of World War II rejected any military research support.

That knocked him out of the official line of intellectual development because the whole policy was to militarize our world and culture.

He is a good person to investigate for the conflict between the technology that he himself greatly contributed to and the way it should be used under the guidance and control of intelligent human beings.

What about hierarchy in nature? Or somebody would say, "Well, it's human nature to rule over other people."

Yeah, that's what they say.

But I mean specifically digital technology because it is the product of this idea of abstraction and that only ideas and atoms exist. That technology itself seems to have an inherent seed inside of itself to eventually degenerate and be used for evil, for control.

Yeah, I've often mentioned that Bertrand Russell, coming from the ruling class, saw what it was doing and worked out the logic that justified it.

But as he learned more about it, he saw that his logic was ideological built into it.

He did that just before the computer thinking, the computability of mathematics and logic took over in the 1930s and 40s, specifically designed around that ideology that Russell had identified.

He saw that logic became a matter of authoritarian reductionism.

Atoms and logical atoms have to be precisely defined before they will work in a computer or a digital control system.

It's exactly the openness to new connections that the human use of language and consciousness is the proper way of human functioning.

And when you design a computable language, you've designed out the human properties that leave it open to innovation.

And Norbert Wiener was one of the people who saw that on a technical level.

In the animal world, if animals on the sub-Saharan Africa or something were high up on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, do you think they would not express aggression?

No, not the irrational aggression. When I was in graduate school, the archaeological anthropologists who were identifying ape-like skeletons in Africa

and claiming that humanity originated with the use of weapons to bash each other's skulls, the hunter-murderer-warrior idea of human beings,

that idea of aggression is closely tied to the genetic theory of survival of the fittest. And survival of the fittest was converted to suit the idea of rule by the elite through military power.

But aggression seems to be a natural response in an animal world when the animal is threatened and is not allowed to retreat.

So something similar must be happening in people too, and that would be a, I don't want to call it a good response, but it would be a natural response, right?

Yeah, self-defense. When you're pushed too far, you might lose rationality in the way you defend yourself, but it's a matter of survival.

People will choose survival at that point, but when their survival is assured to any extent, then cooperation becomes the rule.

As the early biological work of Peter Kropotkin worked out, and some of his followers in the later 20th century showed that cooperation all across the evolutionary spectrum,

cooperation within species and even across species is the basic property of life, like bacteria will give their life-saving genetic material, even the strange unrelated bacteria.

What do you think of the religious idea, when you get hit on one side of the face, turn the other cheek as well? That doesn't sound like a very good adaptive response, does it?

No, I think you have to stop the slapper and then you can forgive him once he's powerless over you.

Will and Blake said that, right?

Yeah.

Okay, so I'm just thinking about my schooling experience, and I hated always working with people.

So what's the difference between that kind of cooperation in this messed up environment and health status of many people versus what you're talking about?

You're talking about something more grandiose and bigger, right?

Bigger than what, for example?

What would lead a person to, or what would be the factors that could sustain cooperation among individuals without the defect of somebody thinking, "Oh, I'm just going to do it a completely different way," or "These people don't know what they're talking about," or something like that?

Or, "I'm going to exploit their gullibility for my benefit."

Yeah. Well, governments have created the channels for unfair advantage.

They've built in privileges for banks, for example, to rip off the general public.

They've given powerful opportunity to develop the constructive interactions.

But now the governments have deeply and powerfully enforced the exploitation systems.

I was going to ask you about Marx and the Rothschild connection, but have you been following that game? I don't know if you want to talk about that.

What is the new story that has captured your mind at the moment? What do you think is important to talk about?

Oh, I think the old story, the creative nature of the so-called material world. That's where we should be putting our energy.

How it is that life has got this far, and what are the processes that will get us out of this current dying condition?

And people hate it when I ask you to speculate about things, but this dollar inflation type of thing, that's on purpose to—

Yeah, they invest in stocks, for example, and then to increase the value of stocks means they're taking power from anyone who doesn't own shares in the big corporations.

So inflating dollar value is ruining anyone who doesn't own one of the systems which is going to survive.

In the process, they are deliberately killing the small businesses that aren't on the stock exchanges, so that all economic activity is being funneled through the big monopolies that they're invested in.

And as part of killing independent business, they are inflating the dollar so that it makes it harder for them with their worthless dollars to ever buy into the monopoly system that is going to take over everything.

Do you think it goes a step further than that? I mean, there's been a lot of talk on the news about this. You may have heard of the company Robinhood, and they're trying to get everybody to invest, basically.

And a lot of people are getting burned in the process. Considering the fact that the banks have all the power and all the information, wouldn't it be a bit of a nefarious idea that they have to convince everybody to invest in the stock market and suddenly crash it when they want it and take out all the profit?

So, in other words, even investing in the stock market is not a good idea for the regular person because it's the banks that call the shots there, too.

Yeah, but they don't know the rules. The giant corporations have computer systems set up so that they can always beat the individual to do timely sales and purchases.

I'm sure they hope that a giant swath of the population will die, but is there anything you've seen recently that makes it more clear of what they're actually going to do with a bunch of serfs that are now dependent on the government?

Oh, just being in that dependent condition, it's already increased mortality greatly. So, just keeping them in an insecure state of relative misery, they'll just die off sooner rather than later.

George, do you have any other questions?

Yeah, I mean, there's already talk, even on Main Street, as they say, of upcoming civil war. Countries are bitterly divided into two, even though they're actually part of the same party, the have-nots.

But do you think that if a significant amount of people tries to revolt or take matter into their own hands and try to organize and try to topple the system, do you think they will go full-blown military-style dictatorship? They will not hesitate and they will implement that?

Oh, definitely. Like the Occupy Wall Street movement, they had corporate control, but authorized by the FBI, snipers ready to kill the leaders. So, they're ahead of us in every way.

But it was slightly different. Occupy Wall Street was still a relatively small political movement. Now, half of the country, at least, seems to basically want out. They don't like that system. They know that it's killing them.

I'm not going to mention any political candidates, but basically they're saying the federal government is out of control, it's an evil organization, and we will try to go our own way. Do you think that if that actually starts manifesting, materializing, basically the powers that be will say, "You know what? We will not let you."

Yeah, I'm sure that's true. It doesn't matter if they're a majority. The military has the biggest weapons.

The spectacle is too big at this point, right?

I guess too much of the truth has become known. It can no longer be concealed through peaceful means.

I think that's true. They wanted to polarize people to get the so-called right and the so-called left to polarize and think of each other as the enemy.

But now it looks like much of the Republican Party is standing for what the traditional Democratic Party stood for, and the Democrats have appropriated the worst elitism of the old Republican Party.

So the polarization is largely imaginary, but they're still hoping to capitalize on that to make the people fight each other instead of who they should be fighting.

Do you think the military will follow the orders to attack its own people? Most of these people come from fairly struggling, regular, working-class families. Why would they obey those orders?

Very often, like in the Vietnam War, I think it was the fragging that finally brought the war to an end. The soldiers.

Started killing their commanders.

Yeah, the commanders were their worst enemies.

Absolutely. Last question, then we'll let you go, Ray. People thought you were inconsistent with the – we were talking about the Rothschilds and kind of the foothold or the position they play in all these things.

And then people were saying, well, Ray has spoken highly of Marx, and apparently the Rothschilds have some specific connection with Marx or funding his work. And so they thought that was an incongruency. What do you think about that?

Did you ever see his article in 1843 or '44 before he was a Marxist article on the Jewish question?

People have called him an anti-Semite because of that article, but in the article, he was calling for a petition to the state Congress to emancipate Jews.

The essence of the article was to support his pro-Semitic emancipation of Jews. His enemies were the Christian state and the various people who opposed Marx were the most radical anti-Semites.

And so his article on the Jewish question was to oppose the anti-Semites and to call for a general, not just emancipation of Jews, but for a general emancipation of humanity from the world of finance.

And I don't know that maybe if he, when he worked for the New York Times, if the Rothschilds were invested in the Times, you could say they were paying his salary, but I don't know of any actual support from the bankers to Marx.

Great stuff. Thanks for that. You don't remember the exact, did you say the exact article, 1843?

I think that was the date on the Jewish question.

So one last question for me. There's a recurring theme on various online forums saying that the Soviet, the revolution of 1917 in Russia and then what became the Soviet Union, this was entirely a project of the Zionists and it had been controlling from the very beginning.

And there was nothing free about this country and on and on and on it goes. But basically it was a pet project of Zionism to kind of create the East and the West of the world and clash it against each other while selling weapons to both sides. Do you think there's any truth to that?

No. I've read for years on the issue and the Soviet government was really a mishmash that was steered very intelligently by Lenin, ignoring ideology to a great extent,

but trying to do something that would end czarism forever while keeping the European and American invaders from taking over the country.

And the Politburo, for example, was made up of people with a bunch of very different ideologies and Lenin was just able to maneuver an anti-czarist, anti-imperialist policy

where the provisional government that they took over was really just an opening to let czarism back in or to let the West come in the way they went in in 1991.

A phony government acting as agents of the West. So there were lots of very pro-Russian people who didn't like Marxism at all but who wanted whatever it was.

Orthodox Christianity, for example, was a big motive. All of these patriotic people saw the revolution as a potential way to get out of czarism and imperialism,

but some extreme ideologists were operating at different times and the fact that it did stay free of the West for 50 years or so, 70 years I guess,

except that Khrushchev was in many ways strongly conceding and influenced by the West and then Gorbachev made further moves that opened it to tie it into international commerce and banking.

Yeah. Normally at this point I would read stickers but I started over the stream and I can't see anything and so we'll have to do that another time.

We had a bunch of donations and I'd love to read the names of everybody but it's not showing up on my thing.

So anyways, we'll end it here. It's been almost two and a half hours so Ray has stayed over time for us.

Ray, thank you so much. Sincerely appreciate it. Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much. Thanks for everybody hanging in there with these...

I don't even know what happened. This is the first time that the stream has basically totally stopped but luckily we have the audio no matter what.

Again, Ray, thank you so much. Georgi, thank you so much. We have an amazing viewership and listenership and so I'm very grateful.

Thank you guys so much. We'll talk to you guys soon and take care. Be safe. Okay, bye everyone.

Peace.

Okay, thanks. Bye.

Now, Georgie Smallbox, Ray Peat, thank you guys for joining us today.

We're a little, I think, earlier than what I said, but Ray, can you continue on that thought?

We were talking about Bitcoin, we were talking about inflation, and we were just talking about the general price increasing of goods, and you had some thoughts on that.

Yeah, the interest-free money that has been saving the economy for a few years, I think last, at the end of fall of 2019,

it was reaching the point where just free money, loans, wasn't enough. They had to figure out some way to radically change things, bringing on the pandemic, or more wars, or something was needed.

I think the basic universal income is going to be phased in gradually with these.

I think the checks to the public are going to get more often until finally it's like everyone is on a pension.

That will make savings worthless.

I see that as once you have everyone basically on a pension, plus inflation that has destroyed any kind of savings,

then you have people under control because then you can just change their pension at will.

And you had a specific time frame, you just said four to five years, so that's actually pretty useful to know, I feel like.

What makes you think four to five years?

Just the rate of increasing inflation over the last two years or so.

One of the websites you mentioned, Zero Hedge, they keep talking about inflation and they keep saying, "Oh, maybe people should start buying gold."

But then I remember that up until 1964, the government had actually prohibited people from owning gold.

Do you think something like that can happen again?

Well, there won't be enough gold. It's already tending to disappear like the U.S.

Won't give back national gold that they were supposedly storing because it just isn't there.

People have been investing in paper gold and I think there just isn't enough real gold left.

The price will just go up if it isn't artificially held down like the government has been doing.

So the price of gold will go up, but there just isn't enough real gold to work as money anymore.

Remember the Senator Ron Paul, the former Senator?

For decades he kept saying, "There is no gold at Fort Knox. They refuse to allow me to do an inspection.

They keep doctoring the paperwork. We have only 1% of the physical gold that the United States claims that it does."

Do you think there's any truth to that?

Yes. Germany and Venezuela, for example, were asking to get their gold that had been stored for them in the U.S.

I haven't heard, but I was paying attention to it for a while and the U.S. was simply stonewalling.

Do you think that may be one of the reasons why countries like Russia and China are rapidly increasing their physical gold reserves,

preparing for the devaluation of the dollar basically becoming worthless?

Yes, I think so.

We talked about it a little bit, but the idea behind Bitcoin is that it's finite, there's a limited amount,

and then some people are saying it's a lot better than gold.

It seems to be getting some institutional support, but you think this is just some kind of misdirection?

I think so.

Actually, there's nothing existing. It's a belief system.

Right now, the changing beliefs about it have made some people very rich,

but buying a small amount skyrocketed in price.

Since it's basically a psychological currency, I think it can be manipulated out of existence whenever the world powers decide to.

In your view, is there any way to hedge your bets against the next four or five years of things getting really rough, monetarily-wise?

No, not really.

If you have some land in a place that is survivable, enough water to support yourself,

and some goats and chickens, and to grow some vegetables, then everything is good until some mobsters or governments decide to confiscate your land.

People accuse George and I of being a doomer on this subject,

but when we talk to you, it really seems like things are not going to pick up anytime soon.

They're just going to get a lot worse.

I know you choose your words very carefully, and you think about these subjects a lot.

I imagine you wouldn't even want to say things would get bad,

just because that might put somebody in a learned helplessness situation.

Also, I was reading some Lennon quotes, and I think he has a quote about saying you're a true friend to somebody

if you actually tell them the truth rather than sugarcoating it or something like that.

What is your perspective on that?

There is a way out, and that is for everyone or at least half of the population to wake up and actually think about things

instead of prejudices that they've been taught since childhood.

If they just start questioning basically every word in their language and thinking, "Why do I think this?"

and then looking at what the absence of facts in their belief system implies,

that could lead to people asking questions.

What can we do about the situation in which a few thousand people are deliberately destroying everyone's livelihood,

making them rapidly more dependent and threatening bigger and bigger wars to keep people fearful?

If millions of people start thinking about what can be done, then naturally basic intelligence is going to come up with some ideas.

What about the tactic of Gandhi, like non-violent non-cooperation?

Do you think if a sufficient number of people simply refuse to participate in the system, that would be enough to cripple it?

Yeah, at some point, if there are enough people.

What would be a few things that would really put a dent into the system,

like maybe refusing to participate in social media, refusing to buy things online maybe?

Just absolute withdrawal from all of the stupid imposed digital systems.

Don't buy anything from Amazon. Don't express your opinions on Facebook.

Which would require you meeting people physically, which would quickly end the pandemic restrictions,

because if everybody decides to meet others, you just can't lock them all up?

Yeah, that's why people ordered not to meet in groups bigger than five or ten.

That used to be called sedition if you had five or six people gathering together on the street to talk about politics.

Was there an actual law like that in Britain or the US?

Oh, in England at different times, when they were very worried about the French or American revolutions spreading.

Wow, so this has some serious historical roots. It didn't come out of nowhere.

Well, at the risk of bumming everybody out, I do want to talk more about this, but I do want to jump into your newsletter, Ray.

Okay, let me scroll down here really quickly.

Okay, so you have a new newsletter. We talked about your newsletter last time, but this one's called "Inflammation, Adaptation, and Aging."

And similar to last time, what was your motivation specifically for writing this?

This seems to connect very closely to the last few newsletters that you've been writing.

Yeah, and it's a step to the next one, which will be how purpose and intentionality relate to development and inflammation and aging.

And this is just making the connections between heredity, adaptation, aging and inflammation, and disease resistance.

Can we get a—sorry, go ahead.

Bringing in the fact that the perfect environment is intrauterine, and then various things can go wrong after birth.

If you're in a hospital especially, they can intensify everything that ordinarily would take 50 or 60 years to go wrong.

They can do it in a couple of weeks, but it's showing the historical continuity between stress, adaptation, and the immune system or developmental system that goes wrong in aging.

It's really popular in the health world to say, "Oh, that's because of inflammation," or "Oh, that's because of inflammation."

And it's never really nailed down what inflammation is.

So what, in your perspective, how do you even define that?

It's what a healthy person who catches, for example, the COVID virus does not experience. Their immune system makes them totally unaware that there has been a virus in their body.

Because the body is so multiply, complexly designed not to go wrong, not to experience inflammation.

It has to be a sick and dying person to get in trouble from such a thing as a minor virus or bacteria.

Once you're sick, then you're already in an inflamed state. And in that inflamed state, one or more viruses is just another pro-inflammatory degenerative factor.

But a healthy person handles resistance and immunity without even noticing it.

So the degree of inflammation that you experience with a wound or exposure to irritants and so on corresponds to your state of health.

If one is deficient in PUFA, is it even possible to experience a significant inflammatory reaction?

Yeah, the experiments with just rats on a PUFA-free diet, a so-called essential fatty acid-free diet, all kinds of tests, poisons, physical trauma, disease, infectious agents.

They're just tremendously resistant to inflammation and dying.

Something as crude as holding them by the tail and whacking them on the furniture.

If they've been eating a standard fatty acid, PUFA-rich diet, they go into shock and inflammation and die.

If they don't have a noticeable amount of PUFA in their tissues, they are very tough.

I just want to see the ethical committee that approved this experiment. The description is we're going to be whacking rats on furniture.

So basically, without PUFA, most of the inflammatory reaction is gone. Is that what I'm hearing?

Right. The PUFA form many things leading to inflammation. Just the prostaglandins are a very powerful amplifier of inflammation.

Some little thing like hypoglycemia can start the formation of prostaglandins. And then once it starts, all kinds of things, cytokines and circulatory changes and such get involved.

Right. And then the leukotrienes and all the other things that are derived from PUFA?

Yeah.

Okay.

Could you say something like the moment lactic acid is released out of the cell or something, that's the beginning of inflammation? Or is it much more complex than that?

Yeah. A shift away from oxidation of the PUFA will inhibit the ability to oxidize glucose. And at that moment, you're experiencing reductive stress or pseudo hypoxia, some people call it.

The oxygen is there, but you aren't using it. And that turns on lactic acid, which represents a reductive state, an excess of electrons.

And that transmits the reductive stress wherever it goes, tends to convert other cells to that same stress state.

And speaking of reductive stress and the lack of oxygen, maybe I'm getting ahead of ourselves here, but the stem cell renewal in the aspect of what you wrote about the loss of stem cells.

Yeah. When you stop oxidizing glucose because of either low thyroid or some poison like nitric oxide or PUFA or carbon monoxide,

the enzymes simply stop reacting glucose and its derivatives with oxygen.

And so the oxygen is still diffusing in from your bloodstream, but it's not being consumed. And so the animal that is feeling its respiration is actually becoming hyperoxic in the vicinity of those poison cells.

And so hyperoxia is toxic to the mitochondria and changes the functions of the stem cells.

It's one of the things that brings stem cells out of their quiescent state and starts them dividing so that in an injury situation where the cell is going to die because it isn't oxidizing glucose,

the stem cells can take over and replace the dead poison cell. But if the cell doesn't get out of the way, then the hyperoxia that has activated the stem cells is going to keep the multiplication going and produce a tumor.

But if it is continuously in great excess, then you start depleting the stem cells and then you have no renewability of that tissue.

So hyperoxia is an outcome of blocking the use of oxygen.

So is carbon dioxide, the intracellular pH, is that the major signal for apoptosis of a barren cell and also the signal for the stem cells to start differentiating?

The failure to produce carbon dioxide, yeah.

Right, so the presence of it will allow the barren cell to commit suicide basically, to apoptosis.

Yeah, its pH goes up, activating its own tendency to undergo cell division and then if there's no glucose available because it's being wasted, then that would be the normal thing that kills the cell.

Is that one mechanism through which the acetylzolomide drug helps shrink the tumors?

Potentially, yeah.

And previously you've been asked about stem cell therapy and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something like "I think we're a big bag of stem cells" and so it's more of the environment of those stem cells than just adding a bunch more into the system?

Yeah, I don't think the idea of taking them out of one place and putting them in another is going to do much, if anything.

If you said that the intrauterine environment is basically the ideal environment for an organism, then by extension once the organism is being born into this world, then if we want to maintain the same level of optimal health, we should live in an environment that mimics the intrauterine one, which is with a lot of glucose and a lot of carbon dioxide. Is that right?

Yeah, and on a high mountain with a supply of good fruit, for example, your oxygen tension is lower at high altitude, closer to the fetal oxygen availability.

And if you're healthy enough to adapt to high altitude, then your CO2 level internally goes up and prevents the hyperventilation increase of pH inside cells that kills them or ages them.

Is there an optimal range of altitude? Because clearly, just climbing up on top of Mount Everest, just to give an extreme example, that wouldn't be healthy. So it's got to be something more, I don't know, reasonable?

Yeah, 8,000 to 12,000 feet I think is good.

Okay.

Going back a little bit on our chat about inflammation, is oxygen stress and inflammation, are those synonymous or interchangeable terms, rather?

No, they usually talk about oxidative stress as making free radicals, but the thing that turns that on is often a block to the ability to use oxygen.

And so the traditional use of oxidative stress has been pretty confused, defining it as just pretty much equivalent to lipid peroxidation and free radical damage.

Do you know who came up with this term, oxidative stress? Because when I read the actual studies, at least the more modern versions, a lot of people are angry in those studies by saying, "Look, we're administering a drug that blocks the electron transport chain complex and creates oxidative stress."

So this term is completely bogus and wrong, yet it still carries on. Somebody must have coined this cultural term and supported it throughout the years in order for it to be so powerful.

Yeah, I think it goes back to Raymond Pearl and Johns Hopkins, a bunch of reductionists, basically an anti-life thing that the slower you live, the longer you live.

Cooling off and being half dead, according to that view, is the way to live longer. Leonard Hayflick was in that line of thinking, just the most absurd and mechanical view of what life is.

Even though he worked for a big cell culture company, he didn't have the faintest idea about how to do proper cell culture. Their goal was just to produce cells to sell them.

He didn't realize that growing 50 generations in a dish is not at all comparable to the living state in an organism.

People fell for that shortening telomere idea that cells necessarily, every division, shorten their telomere and have a maximum division capability of 50 cell divisions.

Back in the 60s, people tested that and showed that our skin and intestine, for example, would use up those 50 cell divisions of our stem cells in just a few weeks or months.

And grafting experiments found that different organs, like mammary glands, could undergo essentially an infinite number of cell divisions when they're in an organism,

supporting the Rockefeller University experiments of growing chicken heart cells, keeping them alive for more than 20 years, just by renewing their environmental solution properly, not letting elastic acid accumulate.

Do you think some of those ideas of the rate of living theory may have been inspired by the second law of thermodynamics and the steam presses from the England's Industrial Revolution saying, "If you keep your machines cooler, they will last longer"?

Exactly. It's all mechanical thinking. And that mechanical thinking, like N. A. Kosiris, looking at the history of these physical ideas, showed that it was a belief,

basically in a big bang creationist universe, that if you believe there was a creation of the universe in one moment, then you can deduce that one-directional running down of the universe.

The idea of a watchmaker, a god who set the universe clock in motion, all a clock can do if God wound it up at one point is run until it loses the wind-up energy.

And so the universe, from that religious viewpoint, can do nothing but run down.

And N. A. Kosiris showed that if you don't make those religious assumptions, then you can explain the stellar energy source, the fact that all of the planets have an internal production of energy,

even the giant gaseous planets turn out to be producing internal energy like a star developing.

So I guess all these people, the religious fanatics, they observed that time passes forward, and the way they explained it was with the big bang and the unwinding of the clock, instead of the opposite, which is the Kosiris idea of the continuous creation, which is that there's more time as time goes by, because time is a property of matter.

Right. And even Fred Soddy, the inventor of the isotope interpretation of atoms, even he, in one of his later books, described his thinking for continuous creation.

He believed cosmic rays were the atoms just coming into existence.

>> Okay. So basically time and space are essentially, both are properties of this prima mater which Aristotle talked about, the pure potential. Does that ring true?

>> Yep.

>> Okay. Jumping back to your newsletter, Ray, and I apologize, I know you've talked about this 100,000 million times, but the idea that tissue injury kind of invites the virus or the bacteria or the fungus, and they're not necessarily harmful in and of themselves, is that correct?

And then I feel like you probably can't talk about that enough today at this time.

>> Yes. And I'm in this newsletter suggesting the probability that the so-called viruses are little packets of nuclear material being exchanged throughout the world by every organism.

And bacteria do it visibly, transmitting the information that they invented themselves to their friends.

And every organism you look at is actually circulating exosomes, packets of information, within themselves in a repair and regenerative process.

But all of their body fluids contain those same exosomes and are being released into the environment constantly.

And so every organism is emitting these packets that are virus-like in structure.

>> If an inflamed cell has an abundance of electrons because its metabolism is being blocked by something, could a viral or bacteria infection act as a sort of like an emergency electron sink in some fashion?

>> Yeah, when the system is working well. I think that's going on all the time. You can transmit actual mitochondria in those packets.

>> What kind of exosomes and what kind of things would people be emitting when they actually do take the vaccine?

Like, a question I've been asked many times is, if a person gets the vaccine, are they actually more harmful to be around, do you think?

>> Yeah, the purpose of the adjuvant, which had always been aluminum hydroxide, was to create systemic inflammation to stir up excitement so that your body would start making antibodies to anything novel that was present.

And they talk about the lipids in these RNA vaccines as transport or mediators of cellular uptake for the RNA, but actually they're the same lipids that have been promoted for use as adjuvant.

So they're just a lipid version of an adjuvant intended to create systemic inflammation big enough to get you to produce antibodies.

And the antibody producing system, I don't think it's properly considered to be part of the immune system.

The whole process should be maintenance of our structural functional system, and the antibodies are part of a cleanup system.

You have, for example, natural killer cells that will remove damaged cells, killing them so the parts can be removed.

And when you have a tissue that isn't quite ready to have the natural killer cells destroy the damaged substance, you have antibodies that are helping to mop up and control and prepare,

clean up the area so that phagocytes can remove the debris and restore some of the cells to normal functioning without having to kill them.

So if somebody was vaccinated, would that be risky to be around them?

Being around sick people, inflamed people, I think always has more risk.

In the winter, people going indoors, staying indoors, and breathing the same air.

Once one person is under stress, they're going to be putting out more exosomes, and if their exosomes happen to be coming out of stressed cells rather than the normal low oxygen stem cell sources,

then their exosomes can be irritating and spread through inflammation.

Do you think that might explain why nurses working in specific hospital wards, in general medical personnel that spend a lot of time with those sick people, tend to come down with similar conditions if they spend years in those same wards?

I think so.

And you described maybe a person being around you, but what happens when a population is like it?

I guess we're already in a sick population, so can it be that much worse if everybody is vaccinated and, I don't know, spreading and exchanging with these inflammatory materials?

I think everything the medical system is doing tends to degrade the whole population a little.

Speaking of degrading the whole population, so Ray, somebody you've mentioned on previous shows was Mike Yudon, who is a former Pfizer VP and Chief Science Officer, and a topic that you and I, I think, first talked about this in 2017, and I know you've been studying it for a lot longer than that, but he said,

"It's my considerate view that it's entirely possible that coronavirus vaccines will be used for massive-scale depopulation." And so given your insights of how these things are formulated or how they're said to be formulated, do you think he might be onto something there?

Oh yeah, the possibility is there, and when you look at the lying, deliberate breaking of the law of high government officials, World Health Organization, CDC, and the top levels of foundations like the Gates Foundation,

you see them deliberately misleading the population. I think it's odd to assume that they wouldn't be trying to execute what they've expressed as their long-range goals, population reduction,

since they have the means now, and since they've demonstrated that they're morally corrupt, and basically profiting from misleading the public to assume that they're not criminal on multiple levels, I think would be a mistake.

And this is something we've talked about. This is like a, I'm using air quotes right here, but an open conspiracy. It's like the culture of the Pentagon and the CIA and the WEF and WHO and CDC, all these institutions.

It's like depopulation isn't a radical idea. It's just kind of the status quo, and it's not an insane idea among the people that populate these institutions, but when you talk to somebody off the street, "Oh, they want to depopulate," it's like, "What? No, that's impossible. How can they do that?"

There's so many immediate objections to that, but what we've talked about before, it's not controversial at all among those people that I just mentioned.

>> Yeah, and that attitude is exactly what you need to keep them as not believing that it's possible while it's going on.

Didn't Kissinger state as far back as the '70s that basically there can be only one destiny for the third world, and that is extermination at the hands of the powers that be, of the Western powers?

>> Yeah, I think that policy was basically decided when Roosevelt died. Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie had a meeting and decided on a post-war policy of bringing the third world up to the rest of society.

Making them independent and affluent and prosperous.

Right after the meeting, Willkie died unexpectedly of a cold.

Within just a few days of the revelation that Dulles and the whole organization were working with the Nazis, Roosevelt died in a very timely way.

And immediately the policies towards the third world changed radically from giving the equivalent of a Marshall Plan to bring up all of the third world countries to a good standard of living.

That immediately changed back to the empire of exploiting them to death.

>> Stalin saw what happened to Roosevelt, didn't buy for a second what the official story was, and would that explain why the Soviet Union became much more hard-line afterwards? He realized what he's up against?

>> Yeah, and even some of Roosevelt's relatives agreed with Stalin that it was an assassination.

>> Speaking of assassination, Ray, do you want to comment on John Magu Fuli and the very likelihood that he was killed in some way?

>> He was the second African president who had opposed vaccinations who died suddenly.

>> The first one was Mugabe, the Zimbabwean? Or no?

>> I forget the previous one, just a few months before, but they were both very antagonistic to the World Health Organization and the vaccine campaigns.

>> Because African Americans are woke to Western medical intervention, you think?

>> Probably more than other countries because they've had more horrible experiences.

>> This is mind-blowing to me, but to you, this has been happening forever. These very critical people of the establishment just passing away instantaneously, and I doubt there's going to be any BLM marches or anything about the death of Magu Fuli.

>> No, I haven't heard very much public discussion of it.

>> We'll continue this chat. Let me do an advertisement here really quickly. We're discussing Ray's newsletter, which is available by email now. It's $28 U.S., and you can send that to rayPeats@gmail.com.

You can also order books by Ray, his "Gender of Energy" book, "1994 from PMS to Menopause." When was that written, Ray?

>> In the early '80s, I think it was.

>> '80s, and then "Nutrition for Women," 1973, and then "Mind and Tissue 2." When was that written?

>> 1973 was when I wrote "Mind and Tissue" a little before "Nutrition for Women," I think.

>> Okay, so you can send that email address and the name of the book, and I still have the wrong prices on here, so they should be cheaper.

And then, like last time, I just wanted to mention Progest-E from Kenogen, and you can email Catherine at Kenogen@gmail.com, and each bottle is 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

And Ray, just want to maybe comment on your thoughts on Progest-E.

>> More men are starting to use it, and you've probably heard the result of the injecting, I think it was micronized progesterone subcutaneously in men who were infected seriously with COVID.

>> Yeah, yeah, we talked about it a little bit last time.

>> A study ended and was published finally that it did improve their survival, so that is increasing the interest of men in using it.

I had probably discouraged men for a long time when I described how a big dose of it is like a cold shower and shrinks the penis, but that effect passes in about one or two days.

So, with the proper dosing, it actually increases libido and keeps testosterone from being wasted and turned into estrogen.

So, it's actually a very important part of the male system.

>> I'm actually glad you brought that up.

So, we have a large 20s, 30s, 40s male listenership.

So, one, how much progesterone does a healthy male make?

And then, I know this is extremely individual, but is there any way to go about dosing progesterone for a male, and what should they expect when they use it?

>> The basic mechanism is that it promotes, a given dose promotes its own synthesis in the body,

and partly that's because it facilitates the secretion of thyroid hormone, which is part of the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone.

And partly because it inhibits the enzyme aromatase that converts androgens to estrogen.

And it supports the internal system of getting the vitamin A and thyroid together with the cholesterol, so that often during pregnancy,

if a woman is seriously deficient in progesterone, one single big dose will sometimes set the pregnancy back on the normal course of producing progesterone at an increasing rate for the full nine months.

Sometimes it takes two injections, but the principle is that when you get the right amount at one moment, your thyroid and gonads and skin and brain, everything gets back on the track to produce enough of your own progesterone.

So it isn't a hormone replacement matter, but it's a stress correction process.

You stop the stress, and if you're well nourished, the organism gets back to its production.

I have a question. I get a lot of questions from parents who are considering using Progest-E in children. Do you have any reservations, misgivings about giving little children progesterone, in Progest-E specifically?

Very premature babies, their brain growth is protected, sort of like imitating intrauterine conditions, to give them a little progesterone for the first few months of their life to keep the brain developing.

That probably can be beneficial if there has been stress so that they had some deficiency of progesterone that could be continued right up through all of the time breastfeeding is going on.

If the mother normalizes her progesterone, the progesterone level of the milk will be adequate, and that will help the baby's brain develop.

But if you give it to a boy just as their puberty is coming on, you potentially, by giving too much for too long, you could delay their development sexually probably.

I don't know if that's ever happening, but I think it's good to think of it as a restorative starting up support rather than a continuing maintenance.

The specific question I'm getting is that a lot of parents are concerned that during the pregnancy the mother was under stress, received vaccines, was working really hard.

So basically they're saying now their children that are born and becoming three, four, five years old, they're seeing some signs that are indicative of a stress imprint.

Like the child is gaining weight, and while the parents are normal weight, the child is having food allergies while the parents don't have them.

Some of them have had really good success with progest-E, and they keep asking me questions.

Are there any concerns about using progest-E sporadically on a child that's small, aside from delaying puberty? Would there be a problem in terms of somehow disbalancing their hormonal status if it's used for a few months or so?

No. It's possible to suppress the formation of testosterone if you take really big doses, but when you do it by symptoms, five or ten milligrams a day can alleviate symptoms.

Sometimes one dose of 20 milligrams can just cure the problem. It doesn't have to be repeated.

But you should always go by watching the effects of it because they are very obvious when you're having progesterone deficiency symptoms, very similar to low T3 symptoms.

You should see the results happening within five or ten minutes or at most an hour.

So you can take a drop or two, wait ten or fifteen minutes, and if you still have the symptoms, then you can repeat it.

How much progesterone daily do you think a healthy child is producing at that age, like before the teens, like a child up to ten years of age, male or female?

Probably somewhere between ten and thirty milligrams.

So that would be essentially, up to that would be a good replacement dosage if the parent thinks there's an issue and they want to try it?

Yeah, the thirty milligrams is a very strong dose. That's the dose that can temporarily shrink a man's penis by blocking testosterone.

But five or ten milligrams is usually a very adequate corrective anti-stress dose.

But for a little girl, those concerns are not present, right? It shouldn't be an issue?

No, I just don't think the larger amounts are necessary because it stimulates its own corrective production.

For a hypothyroid child at that age, do you think progesterone would be safer to try first than jumping directly on thyroid?

No, usually I think it's good to use a small amount of thyroid as if you're eating a traditional diet, eating boiled whole fish or soup made out of all the parts of a chicken or whatever.

That would be giving you maybe a fourth to a half a grain of thyroid every day just as part of your meat diet.

Really, that small amount of thyroid should just be a standard part of nutrition.

The government in the early 1940s required the meat producers to remove the thyroid, setting up a situation in which our diet is pretty free of the natural amount of thyroid unless you drink a large amount of milk.

Even cow's milk contains a moderate helpful amount of thyroid hormone.

What about fish head soup? They're not removing the thyroid from that, right?

Right, right. If you have a fish market, that will include the heads.

I've been receiving more and more people saying they have wild experiences with Cynoplus.

If somebody did feel like that, would you say to try a higher ratio of T3 to T4?

Would you suggest aspirin? Would you suggest progesterone?

Maybe if they were interpreting the symptoms correctly, it being liver related, is that something that you receive messages about?

Yeah, usually the problem is that they don't go at it gradually enough. It should increase gradually over a period of two or three months, steadily increasing, watching your temperature and pulse rate and adjusting the dose according to those.

If you jump right in with what you think is going to be your dose, that's when you're more susceptible to building up too much T4.

What about, so as we go through time here and as people get progressively sicker and sicker, would you see an issue, more and more of an issue with a one to four ratio as people get sicker and sicker?

I've known many people who benefited from going up to about a one to two ratio,

having that little bit of T4 to help hold down their TSH during the night when the TSH contributes to the stress experience.

The bedtime T4 will minimize that and still they're getting a good amount of T3, enough that that will keep their blood sugar up so that they don't fail to convert to T4.

Great stuff. Man, I just had a blank. I wanted to ask you one other question about this. Oh, I remember I was going to say, I have been saying this wrong for 10 years.

And you have mentioned it many times, I think because when I go to the Armour website and I'd read what a grain was, it was about like nine micrograms of T3, maybe 38 micrograms of T4.

And so I always thought that was a grain, but now I understand that a Cynoplus is about, and correct me if I'm wrong, but 12.5 micrograms of T3 and maybe 50 micrograms of T4.

And then a fourth of a Cynoplus is about a half, a little more than half a grain. Is that right?

Close to that, yeah. And the original Armour thyroid, the ratio in one publication was close to three to one rather than four to one.

And they didn't talk about the amount of T4 or T3. They apparently had done it without even knowing the existence of T3 and T2 for so long.

They were relying on testing the biological effects on mice. Every batch they would mix up thyroids from different cows or pigs, whichever it was, and they produced both.

You could buy beef or pork thyroid from Armour and each of them was batch standardized to give a reliable physiological effect on mice.

So they didn't care what the T4 and T3 content was. It was the biological effect. They were defining their grains and they would dilute it accordingly with, I think, lactose and stearic acid or magnesium stearate to glue the tablets together.

- Great stuff, George, if you didn't have a question, maybe we'll take a user, or why do I keep saying a user question? Like a watcher, listener question? Okay, well, let me play this one.

Let me know if you can hear this right. This one's from Sheila and it's about children and school.

- Hey, Dr. Peat. - You can hear that right, right?

- Yep. - Okay.

- Hey, Dr. Peat, this is Sheila. I have a middle school daughter who is remote learning for about a year now due to lockdown restrictions.

And she is understandably failing behaviorally and academically. Good grades, but just we're seeing her fade away.

And my concern is, for me moving forward, trusting what our state offers us and our district offers us academically and how they're going about teaching and then in the future, just investing in colleges.

And I guess what I'm asking is, how do I align my expectations with the reality of what the future is going to look like educationally for these children? Thank you.

I think the thing is to work on trying to get the alignment back to the human concept of what education is via a computer.

Not only a standardized curriculum, but standardized methods and format. Everything is being standardized out of normal human reality.

That just doesn't work in the long run. If you accept it, then I think you're strengthening an irrational system.

I think everyone has to start rejecting digital education, artificial intelligence, as well as standardized curricula.

This is semi-related, but I heard an interesting theory about the mask that they're trying to monopolize human interaction online. And this might be actually completely obvious.

Does that seem reasonable to you?

I suppose that puts people more under the control. If you start having the wrong kind of interactions, it'll be like the censorship of YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.

If they heard everyone under their computers, then they not only know what everyone is doing, but they can weed out the ones who aren't doing it right.

Speaking of, do you think the part of the lockdowns was to get everybody in front of a screen and to kind of consume the fake news as it is?

Yeah. The whole factory system starting 200 years ago was a way of getting people under central control.

Gradually, they realized that that put them together where they had an opportunity to unionize.

Now, the shift to the computer communication, one of the obvious things it does is to make it impossible to have direct contact and organized unions.

Do you remember around 2006 or 2007 when Google was coming up with virtual reality glasses?

Somebody asked one of the founders, "Why would you come up with something like that to mimic reality? Isn't reality more than enough for us?"

The response was, "Who would want to live in this world? Look at how terrible it is. When you put on this virtual reality device, you go into a better world and it's better for you.

Basically, you have the entire world under your full control."

They've been kind of working on this for a while now and marketing along the same lines.

The World Economic Forum people have said that basically human teachers are doing a low-quality job of teaching and communicating.

We can have the best courses in the world. We can essentially have a monopoly on the courses and the curriculum because we'll choose the best lecturers and put them on artificial intelligence programs.

People can then experience all the best in the world, travel by artificial intelligence, and have all of these experiences,

which happen to be owned by the monopoly and controlled to reinforce the monopoly, absolutely making any kind of labor consumer organization impossible.

Do you think some of the drive to really destroy the world around us, at least part of the impetus maybe to turn people off to the real world around them and drive them in mass towards more and more digital embracement?

Yeah, that's exactly what Schwab of the World Economic Forum has said. The sooner we can destroy this old-fashioned legacy economy, the sooner people will realize how great it is to buy only online, to study online, to get medical treatment online.

Actually, it has said that Schmidt, formerly of Google and the Pentagon, and then advising the New York governor on how wonderful it will be to destroy the system of actual school buildings,

hospitals, and medical clinics, and have it all done online.

Recently, CNN had a front-page article saying, "With all of the advances of technology, why leave the house at all?"

I thought, "Wow, they actually said it." They had all these arguments like, "Why would you go to the grocery store where all these yucky, sweaty, whatnot people are rubbing against you?

Why would you go to a sports event? Why would you go to the pub?"

All of these things you can have at your home, fully delivered, everything online, and you don't need to leave the house ever again.

That was front-page news on CNN about two weeks ago.

Where was it?

CNN. It was front-page news on CNN.

Oh, yeah. One of the most horrible lines of the World Economic Forum people is, "You will own nothing. You will rent everything, and you'll be happy."

Only if you take your happy pills, because I don't know how a normal person would be happy under conditions like that.

Do you think the governor of New York is being used as a scapegoat, thrown under the bus to prevent the discovery of bigger crimes that went on during the severe lockdowns?

He's a willing conspirator by bringing in Schmidt as an advisor. I don't think he's a fair-minded, good person.

He was at the forefront of the pandemic. He was the biggest proponent of the lockdowns. It was on CNN and all the media 24/7.

Now, it seems like they're trying to "me too" him. In other words, all of these accusers came out of nowhere.

I don't doubt their stories, but it seems like the establishment is trying to throw him under the bus.

The story is that apparently other states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota had much worse geriatric genocide at elderly care homes.

Now, they're trying to throw Cuomo under the bus to put a lid on the story or at least give the public a scapegoat.

If the full story becomes known, how many elderly people would be massacred by introducing sick people into their homes? People would just revolt.

They should get rid of him for his actual crimes, but if they can shift the attention to whatever womanizing he was doing, that's a way to cover up what he was actually doing.

>> Georgie, do you remember? Georgie and I sometimes trade emails on dark subjects, but something I felt like important that Georgie said and that opened up my brain was that if the public knew what these people were actually doing, they'd be hung out in the streets.

That's why they need to censor everyone and close down everything, because if people actually knew what the pedophilia type of things, and we were reading really disturbing things. Ray, are you aware of the Finders, the CIA project?

>> Oh yeah, I met the guy. He contacted Blake College and offered to provide buildings for Blake College, and so I drove to that place near Washington, D.C. and met him.

It was a fraud, basically. He didn't say it. He said he would be willing to provide 10 adjacent buildings for the use of Blake College, but then it turned out he wanted us to finance his project.

>> You're blowing my mind right now. So this was obviously pre-them getting caught in the park with those dirty children or whatever?

>> Yeah, it was 1964 when I met him. Petty was his last name.

>> That was way before that. Didn't they get caught maybe in the 90s or something? Or am I on a timeline off?

>> The kids in the park thing, I think, was in the late 80s, maybe 90s.

>> But the thing George and I were, like the really disgusting part was the parents offering up their children for, and so we had read things.

>> As a proof that you're part, and you're going to be loyal, basically you have to give up your children.

>> Yeah.

>> Yeah, that's disgusting. Sorry, go ahead.

>> I don't really understand what was going on, but definitely they were working for the CIA, and he was definitely a sleaze.

>> So basically, do you think we've reached the point of no return, basically a sufficient portion of the American public is aware, or at least deeply suspicious of what's going on.

So there's no way to bring these people back into the system as believers, so now it's basically a war of who's going to fight for survival between the elite and the truly woke.

>> Yeah, and the truly woke have to get their act together and stop being so independent, anarchist, libertarian, whatever, that doesn't want to organize.

They've just got to start doing some organizing.

>> One last question. So this is just like the, you've had lots of interactions, like secretly, not your secret, but how many times do you think you've had interactions with the CIA undercover in different situations?

>> Yeah, I've suspected some and had some confirmed, but you never know who else might be actually committed to them.

>> So it looks like the CIA has been violating the Act against domestic spying for decades. They basically just don't care, right?

>> Yeah, yeah. And my friend who I met because I became his surveillance subject many years later after his wife being very drunk after what work he was doing, and she said, "The same as always."

And I said, "Oh, what was that?" And she said, "Surveillance." He had never mentioned that.

So later I asked him what group he was working for, CIA or NSA or Naval Intelligence, I think I mentioned. He said, "None of those. I'll tell you when I retire."

>> Wow.

>> But then he died.

>> I see. So just a personal question, Ray, when you go out to these parties, do you drink with these people or do you let them get wasted and then you ask your questions?

>> Yeah, no, I don't drink.

>> At all?

>> Ray, how quickly did you know the finders dude was totally full of it when you were talking to him?

>> How quickly?

>> Yeah, yeah.

>> As soon as we met, basically.

>> What was the tip off?

>> His sort of greasy manner.

>> Right.

>> Obviously no character, just an absolute ball of sleaze.

>> I'm glad I brought that up. That's really interesting. Okay, let's take another question here. This one's from, I think, Johan? Okay, here we go.

>> Hello, everyone. Hello, Danny, Georgie. Hello, Ray. So I have a question regarding the loss of smell and taste people often seem to experience when getting infected by this new coronavirus.

I have several friends that have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the last year, and these people are young and otherwise pretty healthy in general, and almost all of them have experienced some loss of smell and taste.

And some of them have problems maybe seven to eight months later after being ill. And I read that a study had been done showing that 50 to 80% of people that get the virus experience these kinds of problems.

And I think this seems to be a real issue, you know, and I'm actually a bit surprised that this doesn't seem to be discussed so much in the health sphere, despite what one may think of the pandemic in general or the restrictions being implemented by different countries.

This issue seems to be of some real concern to public health. You know, the people I talk to suffers from the lack of enjoyment they feel towards food. They lose their appetites, lose weight, and so on.

And taste and smell are so important to assess the quality of the foods and drinks that you ingest. So I just wanted to know what are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is some kind of neurological damage going on?

Do you think this will be a case of concern for the general public?

Yeah. Colds and influenza have always affected the sense of taste and smell, sometimes for longer than others. But that type of respiratory infection, a very common symptom was loss of those senses.

And stress, one of the things that happens in stress is that the metallothionein protein is increased and it binds necessary essential metals like zinc and copper, as well as any toxic metals that you're exposed to.

And I think the loss of zinc is one of the things affecting the sensory apparatus. It's an essential component of carbonic anhydrase enzyme.

And I think that in nerve endings and sensory organs, carbonic anhydrase is important for regulating sensitivity. And zinc deficiency has been associated closely with the loss of taste.

Do you think elevated serotonin has something to do with it as well, considering that basically now we know that COVID-19 is, at least a very heavy case, the severe cases that are associated with essentially a moderate version of serotonin syndrome.

And several human studies show that when you give anti-serotonin drugs, there is a remarkable increase in both visual and other acuity.

Yeah, and one of the very most frequent symptoms of the COVID infection is diarrhea.

And anti-serotonin agents such as cyproheptadine have been very helpful for preventing COVID diarrhea, which is undoubtedly a part of the serotonin excess problem.

And the hyperventilation syndrome, disturbed regulation of oxygen, carbon dioxide balance, leads to the inability of the platelets to transport serotonin.

And so they leak serotonin and it increases the systemic activity of serotonin and that poisons all kinds of systems.

So do you think the elevated serotonin may have, in addition to the zinc depletion, do you think elevated serotonin may have some direct neurotoxic effect that may contribute to the loss of smell and taste?

Oh yeah, and it increases the tendency to have blood clots and inflammation of blood vessels.

Yeah, the reason I'm asking is because it's a very common side effect for people taking SSRI drugs to lose a significant portion of their sense of smell or taste.

So it seems serotonin does have that direct effect.

And you mentioned suppressing the renin, angiotensin, aldosterone system with vitamin D, but doesn't zinc also have a part in that in some way, shape, or form?

In what system?

Doesn't the RAS, the renin, angiotensin, aldosterone system?

Oh, yeah, I think the stress reaction is by deranging your carbonic anhydrase.

That's going to be a basic pro-inflammatory thing.

Great stuff. Since we started late, Ray, I'll let you go very soon. So let's take maybe a question or two more, and then we'll call it a night.

But guys, thank you so much for hanging out with us Friday. Thank you, Ray, for making this possible. I apologize for starting late and totally blowing the time on this. All my fault.

Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much, my partner in crime. I sincerely appreciate it.

No problem.

Okay, let's take – this one is from Ruth. Okay, here we go.

Hi, Dr. Peat. Have you heard Geert van den Bosch's theory of immunoscape regarding the COVID mRNA vaccines? And if you have, do you have an opinion on it? Thanks.

What was the first part of the question?

Actually, don't – something's immunoscape. Some person's – do you know what it was, Georgie?

Can you play it again?

Yeah, here we go.

Hi, Dr. Peat. Have you heard Geert van den Bosch's theory of immunoscape regarding the COVID –

Geert van den Bosch's immunoscape?

Geert van den Bosch. Yeah, he's just talking about the standard thing that if you make a vaccine and the viruses – everywhere in a pandemic, a lot of the viruses are going to mutate, as they would anyway.

But the ones that have the greatest opportunity to keep replicating are the ones that have mutated.

And so using the vaccine, any vaccine in the midst of a pandemic naturally is going to favor the mutant versions of the virus, some of which could be more damaging than one the vaccine is working against.

So he's talking just about standard understanding of virology.

And people have attacked him as trying to promote his own vaccine, but I think his vaccine work was for protecting chickens from tumor viruses, something like that.

So he doesn't have a financial stake in this, but he just understands virology enough that he says, "Why doesn't someone talk about why we don't start applying standard virological principles to the use of these vaccines and stop using them, basically?"

Great stuff. Let's do this last one. Go ahead, Geert.

One question. In terms of these tumor-causing viruses, do you think these viruses are anything special in terms of having a particular carcinogenic effect, or do you think they're just inhibiting respiration, which activates the stem cell system, and then basically as long as respiration is inhibited, these things tend to turn into tumors? Or are they actually truly carcinogenic viruses?

I think there are resistant individuals to any virus, but there are some viruses like plant and animal viruses, some of them have a greater impact on more individuals.

So what would be the carcinogenic effect from, let's say, one of the sarcoma viruses that the rumors they use to kill Hugo Chavez?

I think that was a gene transmitted by a bacterium, and it just creates a very intense inflammation.

I think the proper approach always is to use all of the anti-inflammatory tools that you have, high sugar, aspirin, progesterone, vitamin D, antihistamines, antiserotonin agents.

I think if you flood the system with those, you have a chance to overcome whatever pro-inflammatory thing you've introduced.

So speaking of flooding the system, now that the mRNA vaccine is essentially turning people into these highly inflammatory producing machines, do you think that vaccine may lead to cancer for some people?

Yeah, very likely, when you have tens of millions of people subjected to it, and already the reporting system for vaccine injury, studies have shown that fewer than one in a hundred injuries has been reported historically,

and already there are reports of more than 2,000 deaths, several thousand major debilitating injuries, and tens of thousands of other reactions.

So if you multiply those numbers by a hundred, you see that lots of damage is being done.

But specifically the mRNA vaccine, unlike the others which maybe trigger an inflammatory reaction that may last a few days, even a month, this one seems to turn us into machines for producing this inflammatory spike protein, and this will be ongoing.

Yeah, the ACE2 protein is our major anti-inflammatory system, right at the heart of the angiotensin system.

It destroys angiotensin, and as important as angiotensin is in all of the inflammatory degenerative diseases,

if you destroy the enzyme that destroys angiotensin, that's just about the most dangerous thing you can do to knock out our anti-inflammatory basic system.

Wow, okay, so basically cancer here we come, I mean as far as the mRNA vaccines are concerned?

Yeah, all kinds of degenerative things. If people keep producing the spike protein, that will keep knocking out the anti-inflammatory system as long as the DNA and RNA are in their system.

So the rapid increase in the rates of all kinds of degenerative diseases, how do you think they will explain this away? Simply not count the stats and conceal it?

Weren't they targeting VAERS and saying it was like, there was something I saw that they were saying that wasn't accurate or something.

What was what?

The VAERS, isn't that the database of vaccine injury? I saw something from some news and they were trying to say that that wasn't accurate because there are so many injuries.

Well, the studies of going around and looking at doctors and hospitals and looking up actual injuries, they found that not one in a hundred of the vaccine related injuries had been reported.

So even though they've paid out billions in damages, it could have been hundreds of billions if people had been informed that they could and should report their death and injury.

Because there's such specific criteria. Okay. Okay. I'm going to let you go. Let me read these donations really fast. So Peggy T. Hey Peggy. Holly T. Canadian $10. Holly T for $199. Janet Pack for $20. Thank you so much, Janet.

Marado H for $799. I think Australian. Thank you so much. Oh shoot. Holly T for another $399. Thank you so much, Holly. KT for $1999. Thank you so much, KT.

Michelle for $50. Wow. Thank you so much, Michelle. And Marado H for $599 again. Guys, give this episode a like. We have 132 people watching right now. Sincerely appreciate it. Ray, parting words until we catch up with you next month.

Nothing special.

Nothing special. Let's do one last kind of advertisement. Let's let everybody know that they can get your newsletter by email for $28, sending it to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And they can also order a lot of your books. You know, I frequently talk to people that aren't aware that you've ever written a book. And so, "Gender of Entropy" is obviously my favorite of these. But yeah, and you can order these books in digital form by also emailing raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.

Can they also purchase physical copies of these still, Ray?

Yeah, several of the issues are still available on paper.

Awesome. And then one more plug for Kina Jin, email katherine@kinajin@gmail.com. And Georgie, parting words for yourself, sir.

I don't know. I used to say stay sane, but now at this point seems to be, I guess, start organizing. Turn off the TV, unplug the computer, and go outside. Even if you do nothing, I guess it will be more beneficial than what we've been doing so far.

Very good.

Awesome. Guys, we have an amazing listenership. Thank you so much, Ray. Thank you so much, Georgie. And we will see you guys very soon. Take care. Have a good weekend and be safe. Peace out, everybody.

Bye.

And go live. Okay, we are live. We were talking about, I was asking Ray about Florida and Texas.

And so maybe we can start there and then go into the question Georgie just asked,

because I think all this stuff is super important. So Ray, your take on Florida and Texas being these places in the U.S.

that are resistant to, I don't know, they're backing down from the COVID hysteria.

Yeah, that's great. And Texas has lots of places with really good climate up in the hills.

It's a higher altitude, very livable. I don't know any place in Florida that I would consider livable

because of the humidity and heat.

And do you think humans are just not designed to live in a climate like that? What's the exact problem you described?

You have to turn down your metabolic rate tremendously.

Because of the humidity specifically?

Yeah, high temperature, humidity.

Does that mean that people with low metabolism would feel better if they moved forward?

Super hypothyroid people just love it. It's making up entirely for their cold metabolism.

Is that one reason why all the retirees are moving to those places?

I think so.

But you're saying, okay, so you have a naturally high rate of metabolism and so going to Florida would be problematic

because that would kind of be like a too high. Is that what you're saying?

Yeah, one of the things that happened to me, even though I adjusted my heat production somewhat downward,

the humidity and my high metabolism caused me to grow molds like a fungus sprouting out of me.

And when I got back to Oregon under moderate temperature and humidity, they shriveled and fell off.

Wow. I would have guessed that.

And so, okay, so if those places don't get...

Okay, and then, Georgie, sorry to redo this whole thing again, but what was your question, Georgie?

Well, I mean, just based on what I've seen, even over mainstream media, it looks like even in the bastions of COVID hysteria,

I think the measures are kind of falling apart. The population is not buying it.

Even CNN ran an article that there is now a plateau of vaccination. About 38% have been vaccinated.

And now there's these huge surpluses of vaccines left unused because apparently the other 60% just don't want to be vaccinated,

at least at this point.

I think that's a very natural, sane reaction. And the way the climate change doctrine was promoting change gradually,

but it had a time frame of something like 10 or 20 years.

They jumped on the pandemic idea and realized that the time frame for complete takeover would be reduced to two or three years.

But with resistance, there's talk that they're going to have a so-called cyber attack justifying takeover by the governments of the banks.

To save everyone's money by confiscating it basically and turning to a cyber currency and rationing out your own money to you.

Jake, Anika, and I were theorizing about when something like that would happen.

And I think James Corbett just released a video and he said something like they would need, that would be an ideal situation to transition to the new digital currency.

And so if you listen to them right now, aren't they saying that the digital currency is a little bit, maybe a few years away or they don't want to be first?

And so I know it's impossible to tell, but would you expect a cyber attack maybe later than rather than sooner?

I think it depends on how sane the population is. If half the population gets fully aware of the horrors planned for them, then the ruling class is going to have to do something desperate like war or confiscation of the banks.

I'm betting on war. I think that it's their favorite tool to start with. They're the most experienced with it.

And if they start a major war like with Iran or God forbid China or Russia, even the same population will be kind of forced to get on board and support it because it'll be a matter of survival.

Yeah, and they have a situation all set up designed to have no exit except a defeat of Russia in the development of what's happening in the Ukraine.

Putin has made it clear that he isn't going to give up his sovereignty and Biden, I think, has slightly backed off, postponed the world war a little bit.

So I have that article, I don't know if you saw it, Ray, I sent it to you, it's called "Flashpoint Ukraine Don't Poke the Bear." Can you explain that? Because a layman like myself, what would be in it for...

War keeps the capitalist machine going, but if they want to do societal change, what's the benefit of starting war with Russia? What's that going to do for them?

Well, their goal is to have Russia and China completely subdued because Russia has such a tremendous area of natural resources.

Everyone wants to control their resources and so the Russian government has been a nuisance now for hundreds and hundreds of years.

And the West is still trying to think of ways to take total control of their resources. And meanwhile, keeping a mild war hysteria going is necessary to keep Western Europe and especially American economies running.

And what's the deal? What are they trying to do right now? They're trying to make Russia go to war with the Ukraine, is that right?

Well, yeah, they're hoping that Putin will just give up if England and the US, if they give the impression that they will totally back whatever the Ukraine does.

Turkey is getting into it, training Ukrainian soldiers and urging them on to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, which has declared its independence.

And so the surface pressure looks like they're dedicated to having the Ukraine start those invasions and assuming that Putin is just going to let them take the Ukraine, Crimea and the East of the Ukraine under the control of Kiev.

And Putin has said he won't allow that and has already lots of landing craft available for coastal support of those regions.

And so the Kiev government has withdrawn its forces from the Russian border, recognizing that Russia isn't going to invade the Ukraine and is putting them along the boundary between East and West Ukraine,

hoping that threatening to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine will get full support from the West and that will force Putin to back down.

But I think Biden realizes that Putin isn't going to back down and that's why he telephoned him and proposed a summit meeting somewhere, but with no definite date.

So I think Biden just hopes to prolong it so he won't be embarrassed, but he doesn't want to see Russia exercise its existing potential to totally knock out the Kiev government.

It sounds kind of dark, but if we were to go to war or something, you'd almost hope that they won, right? That would be like a better situation for humanity.

Yeah, because the present bunch in Kiev, they honor Bandera who was the leader under the Nazi invasion, so they are literally neo-Nazis who are in control.

And no one really wants them in control. It's only because they create the war threat.

I have seen a few quotes, and we can move on after this, but Putin kind of knows what's going on, you know, the central banks and things like that. Is there anything interesting to mine there about Putin and his understanding of Rothschild network and things like that?

Yeah, under the Minsk agreements, part of the UN Security Council agreement, which the West signed on to, Putin has the power to enforce the Minsk agreements,

and that could involve protecting the Russian-speaking population of the East from the Kiev people who outlawed Russian-speaking.

And so he could evacuate all four or five million population of the Eastern Ukraine movement to Russia and just leave that half of the Ukraine as a vacant territory as long as the Kiev people want to keep up their threat.

Anything else here, Georgie or Ray? I was going to move on. Ray, I sent you a Notion document, and so if there's anything else left to say there, I was going to move on.

I remember, I think I emailed you in our first episode. I was like, oh man, I'd love to talk about something other than nutrition, maybe philosophy or history, but I think I've come full circle.

And I was thinking if we could do an episode about anti-stress nutrition for 2021. So I've said it a few times, but I think you're getting more popular, and I think as you grow more popular, some people find your nutritional ideas esoteric, and I don't think that's true,

but I thought maybe we could try our hand at encapsulating some of the core ideas in an episode. So I don't know where to go.

They found them so esoteric that they blatantly plagiarized them and presented them as their own.

Yeah, that does happen.

Ray, you'd be amazed at just how many "famous" podcasters are essentially reading off of your website and never mentioning your name even once.

No kidding. What do they quote?

They actually verbatim pick up paragraphs from your website, and the way you can check it out is if you – I have to find the exact sentence, but you can search Google for a full sentence you put into quotation marks, and then it gives you all the websites that contain this exact sentence.

You'll be surprised how many other websites are just directly copying your stuff. Not entire articles, but full paragraphs are routinely taken from your website and posted as their own.

For years I've been running across things that are obviously my sentences in strange places.

Well, it's becoming mainstream. Some of the more famous podcasters, some of them former low-carbers and paleo advocates, are now fully getting on board of the metabolic diet and gaslighting their former clients by pretending that they're still low-carb but writing about your ideas.

I'd be a hypocrite if I criticized. Ray, isn't maybe for a directionless young man or something, copying what they want to be, isn't there some philosophical angle, like copying before you can develop into the person that you're going to be rather than what you want to be?

Like having models to imitate, to try out?

I couldn't guess for you, but maybe like an Albert St. Georgio or Heraclitus. I'm sure you're your own person from the beginning, but for a culture that tells people that there's no meaning or whatever.

What I'm trying to say is if somebody copies something that I've written, I really try not to take it so personally because I know that I did it to you.

Oh, yeah, it makes me feel good actually that someone likes my sentences.

What is it, the plagiarism is the highest form of flattery? Is that how the expression goes?

Yeah, it's nice to see someone liking the same phrases.

But maybe in Wilhelm Reich's Listen, Little Man, he says something towards the middle of that book. He says like if you just copy and you're not trying to add anything to it, that's when you're kind of...

Exactly. That's where I think we have direct empirical knowledge of continuous creation. For the astronomers, it's the color of the galaxies and such things.

But in our own experience, it's the experience of communication as producing something new. Every time we talk, words don't directly transmit anything.

A computer symbol does transmit anything, but no intelligence is transmitted in a computable sort of language which isn't language.

But natural language, each word is an ambiguity and the receiver has to do a creative invention to understand it.

So every time someone is talking and really understanding what the other person is saying, the receiver is doing a creative act, creating new structures that never existed before in the universe.

And so talking is an example of continuous creation.

And that's why when somebody passes away, using their phrases or the things you've learned from them, you're kind of keeping them... I don't know what's the right way of saying it. They're alive in the conversation or the act of creation even when they're gone.

Yeah. As soon as you understand what they're saying, you have given them existence abroad in the world.

I love it. That was great. So tagging on that philosophical conversation, you had quoted... I forgot where you said this, but it was maybe like a high level view of nutrition.

I think in the diet world, eating nutrition is like doing something you don't want to do. And you really want to go to McDonald's and eat that every day. But unfortunately, to solve the problem the person's having, you have to eat the carrot and drink orange juice or something.

So there was that quote, and I think Karen first mentioned it to me, but you were talking about Pavlov and eating is our closest interaction with the world. So maybe, I don't know, just your general view of what is the meaning to the organism? What is nutrition's meaning to the organism in that kind of way?

Yeah. For many years, I've seen talking about food and understanding what food is doing as an extension of discussing philosophy and politics. It's a very powerful way of getting at the nature of existence and working on improving existence.

Could expanding consciousness be another way for improving existence? Can you go into that a little bit more?

Yeah. Raising your body temperature makes it easier to create new levels of being. And when you have expanded your understanding, that makes everything you do easier.

Things that you don't understand, like opening a door that's latched, if you don't understand the latch, you can't open the door. But once you understand it, then you can open all the doors with a similar latch.

And so it makes your range of meaningful activity much greater every time you have a general increase in meaningful understanding.

Well, that's one of the reasons I wanted to do this. I think you have another quote somewhere. It's like, "Things should make no sense until they make the right sense." And that 100 grams of protein is meaningless until it's the most important thing ever.

I feel like I've come, talking to you and incorporating a lot of things that you've written about, I feel like I've come, maybe I have a cyclical process of thinking something is not important until thinking it's the most important thing on the planet.

So again, we talked about the high-level view of nutrition, and maybe before we get into dietary things, maybe you could speak about appetite in general, because I think that dietary things are almost useless in the face of somebody having a really suppressed appetite. So what is your general view of appetite?

I think it comes down to the question of our relationship to our cells and our molecules that make us up.

I think eventually we have to start thinking of our cells as having appetite and judgment and purpose. And that has been demonstrated in unicellular organisms all the way down to bacteria, that they have planning and judgment and purpose.

And if we deny that to our own internal cells, that just seems silly when you can demonstrate it in free-living single cells that don't have nervous systems.

But our nervous systems are intimately connected to our cells, and we get our motives essentially by listening to our cells, the unconditioned reflexes.

It's a message, sort of a voting of the intelligent population of cells that we listen to and then execute with things like appetite.

Do you think appetite can be equated with desire for life, more or less? Basically, the better your appetite, the more you want to live, more or less?

Because you're in touch with and listening to your life process all the way down to molecules.

Right. And on a related note, let's say you have a great appetite, but different days you desire different foods. Do you think there's something more than just beyond the organism sensing that they need certain nutrients, maybe certain foods create certain different meanings, depending on what your mind and soul need?

Yeah, I think so. Variety is a real thing. You're wanting to discover more about the nature of the universe and the desire for variety is, I think, part of that natural curiosity of our cells.

Are you familiar with the customs of the Native American Indians? They believe that whatever food you eat, and they did eat a lot of animal protein, it kind of gives you a piece of that animal spirit.

And they believe that eating the meat of only one animal, except for bison, was not a very good practice because it sort of crystallizes you and makes you very rigid and unable to fully explore life. So they very much supported variety in their diet.

Have you read the experiments of McConnell in the 1950s? The Worm Runner's Digest was one version of his publication. He describes first training planarians to respond in a certain way to light or dark,

and then chopping the trained planarian up and feeding it to an untrained planarian. And they gained the knowledge that was intended by the first planarian.

So basically memories, I remember a study that came out about three or four years ago that said that the memories are actually stored throughout the entire organism. They're not located in the brain.

Right. The different parts of the worm contain the energy.

George Unger followed up McConnell's work with different organisms. He found that the nucleic acid, especially RNA composition of a catfish, for example, was changed according to what it was smelling in the water.

So the sensed material or the learned material causes molecular changes, and those molecular changes extracted from that organism can produce the same knowledge and patterned reactions to an ignorant organism

that had been created in the first experiment.

So this is similar to Rupert Sheldrake's morphogenic resonance but applied to food?

Yeah.

Again, I'm not an expert on that idea. Isn't that the idea that the memories are stored non-locally? So aren't these ideas incompatible?

No, since he was extracting the brain, but the whole organism is affected by what happens in the brain, and you get similar metabolic changes in all parts of the organism.

So when a person wakes up in the morning and all the way till noon and they have no appetite for food, you're saying that it's like the cumulative cells vote, maybe under the influence of serotonin or something, to decrease the rate of metabolism. Is that right?

Yeah, but something is going wrong and they have to sit back. Like when bacteria in James Shapiro's experiments, when he gives them an unmetabolizable sugar, they just sit back and wait for two days and then institute a gene change.

They don't want to do anything prematurely that isn't necessary. So they sit back and judge the coming future before they change themselves.

How do the cells achieve quorum? Is it done strictly through chemical signals or electromagnetic as well?

I think both. One of the things that turned out with experiments by Beatrice Gelber, for example, in the 50s and 60s, was that the planarian can see what's happening.

They have purposive behavior and looking at the source, they can do some things when light is present for interpreting chemical signals that they can't do in the dark.

They're looking around, taking things into account. The anatomy of a single-celled organism for a long time has been known to include the equivalent of a focusing eyeball and brain.

A professor of mine described meeting a specialist in amoebas who showed him some photographs and asked him to identify the organism he thought they came from.

My professor judged a primitive chordate organism and said that's clearly a chordate eyeball and nerve fibers and so on.

It turned out that his size scale was off about 100 fold and the pictures were actually of the photosensitive spot of an amoeba.

What people thought was just a reflex reaction when light hit that spot was actually shining a light in the eyeball of the amoeba.

The fibers from that eyeball connected to a coordination center are also grossly recognized.

In the case of the planarian, they were studied for a long time to look at epigenetics or the inheritance of acquired learned characteristics.

They were discarded as an experimental organism by about 1950 because it was too clear that they were totally knocking out all of the genetic doctrines and the idea that learning is nothing but an unconscious chemical reflex.

Their purpose and judgment and evaluation of the situation was becoming clear and the mechanistic idea of how a gene controls mechanistic reflexes just wouldn't work.

Do you think that since we modern humans are now being bathed 24/7 in these electromagnetic frequencies,

are they capable at least at some frequency of interfering with the cells' ability to form a quorum and have purposeful meaningful development?

I've been thinking about the interactions of our normal internal infrared wavelength emissions such as with an infrared sensitive camera you can see warm organisms as luminous areas in the dark.

That tremendous emission of energy in the more or less infrared wavelengths calculations and experiments have shown that about three quarters of our metabolic energy is going out in that form of radiant energy.

The temperature maintained that makes that emission possible is also governing the rate of energy metabolism and the whole signaling system is very responsive to the emissions from other wavelengths.

The emission from other warm parts of the organism, for example, if you grow a layer of fibroblasts, they tend to line up parallel to each other.

When the experimenter grew another on the opposite side of the glass, they plated another bunch of the same kind of cells and found that they tended to align themselves perpendicularly to what was on the other side of the cell of the glass.

So they were receiving obvious signals transmitted through the glass that told them what the orientation that they should take would be.

The person doing this, Gunther Albrecht Buehler, did many things clearly showing that cells, with regard to infrared energy at least,

they have a directional eye equivalent that can see what direction the infrared is coming from.

This is just a simple component cell of an organism such as a fibroblast or an epithelial cell, something that cultures easily.

He showed that under the microscope, focusing a very narrow beam of infrared light, he could get these human cells to chase it, to move with reference to a spot of infrared emissions.

So definitely the infrared spectrum is part of our internal maintenance of organization.

So you don't want to mess with beaming those frequencies through the organism because they'll be taken as a signal for reorganization.

Part of it involves decompacting the compacted nucleic acids of the nucleus and increasing the expression of RNA and proteins.

So you can disrupt basically every level of cell organization just with electromagnetic energy.

So basically, depending on the frequency, a specific electromagnetic radiation will probably randomly heat an organ whose cells are of the right size so that they start acting like an antenna.

You don't want that because you're randomly heating up a portion of the body and you don't know how those cells and the other cells that are communicating with them, how they would react to this random warming up that doesn't seem to be coming from a coherent activity inside of the organism.

Right. When they were studying the damage done by radar beam exposure, they had experienced a few sailors having their brains cooked when they walked in front of a certain wavelength of radar antenna, but other wavelengths didn't mess up their brains.

So they experimented and found that the size of the organ resonates with the wavelength so that a monkey with a small brain could be killed by a higher frequency that wouldn't severely damage a human with a big brain.

So the higher the frequency, not only are we getting closer to ionizing radiation, but there's a higher chance that some cells in the organism would be of the "right size" and then react negatively.

A cell or part of the cell.

Part of the cell. Okay. So if it's part of the cell, is it possible that even non-ionizing radiation, if it's of the right frequency, can cause DNA damage even though it's non-ionizing?

Yeah. Blue light, for example, does damage DNA.

Okay. Wow. So there's no safe electromagnetic frequency, I mean long-term exposure. It's not possible to completely avoid it, but it's certainly not a good idea to sit there for long periods of time.

Yeah. Daylight, I think, is perfectly safe if you don't overexpose the ultraviolet and blue part of the spectrum.

Okay. I don't know if you've seen these papers, which got immediately retracted. They were published in around May of 2020. I think it was a team of Italian researchers which said that 5G is now of the right frequency to cause holes inside of the cell and then the cell reacts by plugging these holes by producing endogenous viral particles that just happen to match almost perfectly the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Do you think that there's any truth to that?

Probably if they had the data that led them to submit it for publication, I would suspect that the editors just didn't like it.

Yeah, it was sitting published for about a month and then there was this huge outcry on social media, of course, where else would it be coming from, the cancel culture, and then they forced the National Library of Medicine, the PubMed people, to retract it. It's still there, but it just has this big retraction notice written all over it.

Well, speaking of EMF, isn't part of the problem, I mean, I've read this, you could correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it placing calcium where it's not supposed to be? It's loading the cell up with calcium, and so therefore eating a high calcium diet would be, and taking vitamin D, would be two things to help mitigate the effects of our ultra-saturated environment with all these different types of EMF. Is that right?

Yeah, one of the things that vitamin D and calcium in the diet accomplish is to reduce parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone, under the influence of any kind of inflammation promoting signal, turns down energy production, reduces oxidative phosphorylation.

And so eating calcium and vitamin D will tend to restore mitochondrial energy production, helping the cell to keep calcium out of the cells.

So let me, okay, so this is kind of my, please correct me at any point if you do not agree with this, but these are some of the points that I thought I've gathered from listening to you and reading you over the years. And so if some, like basic requirements for a human living in 2021, obviously gathering pulse and temperature, like it's a loss without those things. Like if you don't know where you're going, if you don't know where you are, I think that's a quote from you.

And then you've said many times, maybe a hundred grams of protein and quoted a military studies. And then maybe two to three times the amount of carbohydrate, obviously favoring sugars over starches, 1500 to 2000 milligrams or more of calcium, and obviously favoring calcium over phosphorus.

And it's very easy to get an abundance of phosphorus, which like you just talked about, will turn on the parathyroid hormone among other things. I don't know specifically your thoughts on fat. And so maybe we could dive in like a fat gram amount per se for, for again, a basic requirements for a person living in 2021.

If we had a source of pure palmitic and stearic acid, especially stearic acid or higher saturated fats, I think they would be safe.

We could produce our own N minus nine polyunsaturated fats, which are the ones that normally produced extensively in the brain and were substituted through time and eating by the N minus six and N minus three unstable polyunsaturated fats.

So with oleic acid, palmitic and stearic acid fats are pretty safe and a compact form of energy availability and storage.

And some experiments show that, like Han Selye showed that cocoa butter rich in stearic acid protected heart against the damage caused by linoleic dietary PUFA.

Just adding the extra stearic acid had a protective anti-heart necrosis action.

And more recent experiments show that the visceral fat percentage can be reduced by increasing stearic acid in the diet.

And to some extent, an excess of stearic acid tends to support subcutaneous fat, which is the appearance that a very healthy child has, for example, giving their skin smoothness and shapeliness and so on.

Is the gaunt look of older, very sick people due to the fact that they're rapidly losing subcutaneous fat but gaining visceral one?

Yeah, it decreases under the skin where it has actual purpose, insulation and elasticity and so on. And it creates the organ defending internal abdominal sort of fat.

Assuming you could get a good source of saturated fat, would you feel comfortable putting a gram number or a range that you felt comfortable, maybe for a hypo-metabolic person or is it purely based on experimentation?

Yeah, it would just be since I've never had the opportunity to have a pleasant tasting pure saturated fat, but I would guess you could eat a lot of it.

What about in the case that you could not get that? Like, is there, okay, so maybe I'll rephrase this question. What about non-activating the Randle cycle or being as efficient with your energy as possible? Like, would you feel comfortable making a suggestion for that?

Yeah, sugar is my current understanding of what is most protective. Stress tends to increase your circulating free fatty acids, activating the Randle effect, blocking the ability to use sugar for energy and increasing the sugar in your diet.

It tends to lower the lipolytic activity, keeps the fat where it belongs and prevents the Randle shift to fat oxidation and so it maximizes your carbon dioxide production which keeps your stress producing lactic acid inhibited.

Those vegan and vegetarian authors for diabetes, sometimes they'll say, you know, if your blood sugar is out of control or something, you're eating too much fat and then they'll recommend ridiculously low amounts like 10 or 20 grams. Obviously, they're probably onto something with that, but do you think there's a middle ground for longevity and taste in general? Maybe around, I don't know, sub 100 or something? Would you feel comfortable with that?

With how much?

Like sub 100 grams or so?

Yeah. If you include oleic acid and stearic and palmitic, I think something around an ounce would probably be ideal, but I don't think there would be any harm up to that.

I think it's up to even a thousand calories per day.

Do you have something to say?

Correct me if I'm wrong, Ray, but isn't the problem with most type 2 diabetics and obese people in general, it's not the amount of fat they consume after already getting obese, but the fact that they're under chronically elevated lipolytic state under the influence of cortisol and estrogen and in that case, eating more saturated fat would actually help because it would increase the ratio of the saturated fat to PUFA in the bloodstream and will mitigate a lot of these effects of lipolysis which mostly liberates PUFA from the stores, right?

Yeah, and PUFA is a promoter of estrogenic effects in many different ways. It activates the estrogen process.

Quick question about androgens. As you probably know, bodybuilders are notoriously averse to dieting or the various caloric restriction and they abuse steroids in order to lose weight and gain lean mass. Considering the fact that both testosterone and DHT and progesterone are anti-lipolytic, under what mechanism do you think they are capable of causing rapid fat loss without really increasing the amount of fat they consume?

There must be some other mechanism going on there.

Yeah, the liver, when it's well nourished and activated by thyroid rather than estrogen effects, the liver can harmlessly excrete PUFA.

Any PUFA that appears in your bloodstream can be recognized by the liver as a toxin and inactivated by attaching glucuronic acid to it, for example, and causing it to be excreted in the urine.

So, the androgens are basically protecting the liver and allowing it to be able to excrete more and more PUFA?

Yeah, and thyroid and progesterone and aspirin, such things, work in that direction.

Have you seen the human studies from the 1960s from Italy showing that this group there was capable of curing even advanced cases of cirrhosis by injecting testosterone and vitamin B1?

Seems reasonable. I've known a couple of people who, one had a very big belly that, as the doctor said, was totally cirrhotic, hard liver from 50 years of using heroin and alcohol constantly every day.

A period of about 5 or 6 months of using T3 and progesterone every day in fairly large amounts. As the doctor said, he couldn't find any sign of cirrhosis at the end of about 5 or 6 months.

Was he using the progesterone and vitamin E as per your formulation or was this another one?

Yeah, he came to my house on Christmas Eve and brought a few quarts of wine and beer with him in case we didn't have enough.

So he finished that by bedtime. As he went to bed, I gave him a bottle of progesterone and told him to use whatever felt right. In the morning I came out, he was already in the kitchen sitting at the table smiling, said he never came off a drunk without a hangover in 50 years or 40 years of being addicted.

Wow. Do you know how much he used on an average daily basis?

Half a bottle the first time.

Oh, half a bottle the first time.

Yeah. And he went on using about two bottles a week during that period of a few months and I asked him if he wasn't having any suppressive effects on his libido and he said no, none at all.

Didn't you say he was also using maybe 50 micrograms of T3 in the morning and then again at night? So he was using progesterone and T3?

Yeah, and he was also having his doctor inject magnesium.

That's the biological addiction imbalance newsletter. I remember that so well because I think like, so I don't want to go into a rat hole here. Were you going to say something, Jordi?

No, I was going to ask about the polycosinols because I've seen some similar studies that showing that they can completely prevent the obesity from a high fat diet where the calories from fat were basically 60 to 70%.

It was almost all of it PUFA and they fed the animals the human equivalent of about half a gram, which is pretty high of polycosinols and those animals actually got leaner than even the ones eating the regular food.

And I was wondering what the mechanism might be but I suspect it's probably again, it's protecting the liver from peroxidation.

Yeah, I think it's the same effect as the stearic acid, only more concentrated, super saturated, longer chain, super saturated long chain alcohol in that case, which is converted to a fatty acid.

Yep, you just answered my other question. There's an older study from the 50s which didn't directly say that but hinted that fully saturated fats, the longer the chain, the more potent they are.

So instead of eating say 50 grams of stearic acid, you could probably get similar effects from like, I don't know, 50 milligrams of polycosinol.

Something like that, yeah.

Okay. What about, isn't hypothyroidism associated with a gallbladder disease? What if somebody has a bad gallbladder? They should probably eat less fat, right?

Yeah, taking thyroid clears it up very quickly and predictably.

And that's, you would know that if you were passing kind of lightly clay colored stool, is that right? Would that indicate a specific problem with the gallbladder?

Yeah, a very serious deep problem which goes with high estrogen very often. But getting liver back to metabolizing properly, the gallbladder responds quickly and you can, within just a few days, you can start tolerating fats in your diet and lose all of the gallbladder.

Interesting. Okay. So fat, this would obviously take a lot of experimentation. So something maybe you are more suggestive of or I don't know what the right phrasing would be, the 100 grams of protein.

What happens, you've said a few times that eating less than that makes the liver think you're starving. Is that right? So what have you figured out or what is your hypothesis of the significance of around that number for liver health?

It probably depends on the balance of amino acids. When your body senses a protein deficiency, it turns on the proteolytic enzymes so that it takes down your thymus gland, lymph nodes, muscles, skin, all of the expendable momentarily expendable proteins.

And those proteins are converted to the essential amino acids which your brain and essential organs, lung and heart, need to keep working.

So the sense of protein deficiency is essentially a proteolytic state which takes your whole body down.

And maybe in a…

Doesn't the liver also need dietary protein specifically to produce sufficient amounts of albumin?

Oh sure, but combined with thyroid function.

Right, right. Because some people would say like, "Hey, well what's the problem with not eating enough protein?"

Obviously, you can, because since you have protein on yourself, the body can use it to shred it and then convert it into albumin.

But human studies have shown that if you, that in starving people, despite their blood levels of amino acids going really high from the high cortisol, cortisol actually suppresses the synthesis of albumin.

So all these amino acids end up getting, oxidizes fuel which is really bad because it generates all this ammonia.

Yeah, and estrogen is another suppressor of albumin. It goes with high cortisol.

Would you revise this upwards or do you still feel comfortable with 100? Is that like a good base amount or what do you think?

In the military study that was for even little people working at a desk job, that was required for efficiency.

And they didn't say what a better, that was just a minimum for work efficiency.

Would it depend on weight though? Like a bulkier, heavier person with more muscle mass, they probably wouldn't…

Okay. And maybe age too, right? I think in the old newsletter with Lee Daly, you said maybe 120, 150 was even more appropriate for an older person.

Yeah, I think so. The 100 was just the minimum for efficiency.

Is there a point at which this dietary protein can cause kidney issues in a hypothyroid person?

Broda Barnes experimented eating a lot more meat in his diet. He found he had to double his thyroid dose.

So it's very easy to overdo the protein, displacing carbohydrate I imagine is what was happening and liberating the thyroid suppressing tryptophan.

Cysteine and methionine. So as far as I know, experiments using natural gelatin as a protein lacking those antithyroid amino acids,

they could tolerate a fairly higher dose of protein.

So speaking of the gelatin, since it's deficient on those inflammatory amino acids, is there like a ratio of the gelatin to the rest of the protein as part of the total that you think is more beneficial?

Let's say 70% of protein may come from gelatin and then the other 30 from a complete protein that contains all of the essential amino acids.

Probably and I think that changes with age and activity level. A young person who is growing at a very high metabolic rate needs more of the methionine, cysteine, tryptophan type protein.

So for an adult, is there any role physiologically needed for tryptophan aside from producing niacin which people can take as a supplement?

A little bit for tissue replacement.

So there is a minimum amount of tryptophan that everybody needs?

Yeah, making hair and skin and gut cells that have to be shed.

For methionine, the human studies found out that most people don't need more than 2 mg per kg of body weight daily.

Of course, we all ingest a lot more than that which shows you that we can do a lot better.

Is there any guideline you can do for tryptophan? Have you seen any studies on that?

It's pretty much the same. When you reduce any of those 3 amino acids to a minimum, life expectancy in the animal experiments goes up tremendously.

Is there any way for somebody to gauge if they're becoming too deficient on tryptophan? Let's say they're abusing the gelatin and they're eating too much of it?

Digestion is usually the first thing to go wrong. They'll start getting gas or some digestive symptom which could be that they're not replacing the lining of the intestine fast enough to make digestion work smoothly.

A gelatin abuse.

Gelatin junkie.

Moving on from protein, I don't know where I got this number from. Correct me if this is not even something you've ever said before.

Maybe you talked about the 250 in the monkey experiments where their cortisol would increase.

Again, I know this is painting a huge broad statement for thousands of different people experiencing different intensities of stress, having different generational backgrounds and transgenerational histories of stress and things.

But is there maybe a base amount of carbohydrate you think a person needs to function again living in our PUFA-laden, stress-laden, EMF-laden culture?

I've experimented on people with a 100 gram carbohydrate diet and I don't think that was even close to a good health level. It helped them lose weight but it was partly protein weight.

I think it's probably around that range of 200 or 300 that's minimum.

Now what does it mean when a person needs way more than that, like 400 or 500? Does that mean their liver isn't efficient at storing glycogen or they're under chronic stress or what?

Or they just have a very intense metabolic rate. If you're consuming oxygen at twice the rate of normal, then it would be reasonable to expect that you need closer to a pound of carbohydrate per day.

And then similar to protein, would you expect, so say somebody is as healthy as they possibly could be in our current situation, say like moving forward, would you expect them to increase the carbohydrate content getting into older age or would you expect them to decrease the carbohydrate content?

I think increasing it is helpful.

Interesting. Okay, do you have any specific carbohydrate or sugar questions, Georgie?

Yes, I do. What is your view of some of the sugar alcohols that are present in some fruits that are being used as a relief from constipation, let's say prune juice? I think it contains sorbitol. Is there any problem with people using that for relieving occasional constipation instead of or on top of the carrot salad?

If it works as a laxative, you're going to absorb very little of it, but it does have some potential harmful effects. So I think unless you need it as a regular laxative, I think it's better to use just the cellulose fibers.

I'm asking specifically as a laxative. Some people are saying it's very convenient to carry around a bottle of prune juice and you can find it in almost any store if you're traveling or something like that. And most of the sorbitol is not getting absorbed, is from what I understand. So would there be a problem using that as a natural laxative remedy?

Yes, as long as it's having the effect of emptying your bowel, that means it's mostly not being absorbed. But if it doesn't work as a laxative, then it would tend to get pushed into your tissues.

Okay. So using it as a laxative, do you see any problem with that?

No.

Do you know of any other fruits that may have this laxative effect but not being due to the fiber? Maybe by decreasing inflammation or something similar?

None that I'm aware of, but it's a definite possibility.

Okay. So I guess things like cascara are known because they contain the emodins. I read something about rhubarb juice, from like rhubarb root may be able to do the same?

I think the main activity is an emodin-like substance.

That it also contains. Is that why it's red? Because it maybe contains emodin?

Probably. I'm not sure what the main red pigment is, but it could be that the emodin is part of the color. The root, which contains a lot of emodin-like chemical, I don't know what the color is.

Okay. And another question about potential antibacterial effects of some of the sugar alcohols like xylitol. Since it's not absorbed, people are using it as a mouthwash to kill the oral bacteria.

Would there be a potential beneficial effect on using it as an over-the-counter antibiotic? Because it does seem to kill a pretty broad spectrum of bacteria.

Some people react badly to it, and I don't know whether it's the xylitol itself or impurities from its manufacturing origin.

Okay. Say, Ray, you can't get sweet oranges, what are the other carbohydrate sources that you can eat in abundance that you feel comfortable with?

Nixtamalized corn is my favorite safe starch or carbohydrate equivalent because the lime process or lime treatment degrades so many of the toxic factors.

What about frying the starchy foods in saturated fat like butter or coconut oil? Would that decrease their propensity to cause issues?

Yeah, the uncooked or undercooked starch grains, presorption is one of the risks, and having it with fat decreases the ability of it to cross the lining of the intestine.

What about the status of orange juice concentrate? Do you think that's safe to consume right now?

Yeah, especially if it's from sweet oranges.

Yeah, okay, so I've never seen that here in Mexico. Did you ever see it when you were here?

No. There's many good oranges, that would be silly.

Well, it's hard to find, maybe it's just San Miguel, but right now all the oranges are just super sour. And so I'm hoping in June and July things change up. But again, it could be gringo central San Miguel where that's happening.

Yeah, maybe they think sour oranges are preferred by gringos.

Or gringos are the only ones not smart enough to buy them.

Very possible, very possible.

I've been thinking about the meaning of ingesting citric acid. We make it ourselves, but it stays within the mitochondrion. But when you eat it as a chelator, it can drag all sorts of toxic metals into your bloodstream and all the way through your cells.

And then being oxidized in the mitochondrion, it would be leaving behind whatever junk it dragged in with it.

I'm really glad you mentioned that. So the sour orange juice is higher in citric acid and that is why it causes irritation? Is that why?

Yeah.

Okay, and...

Go ahead.

People say that we produce citric acid normally, but it's a compartment thing. It's very, very isolated and in the wrong place. It has very bad effects.

And I hate to be redundant, but maybe we can emphasize how critical that is, maybe, especially for somebody with bad digestion. I think people kind of laugh at that idea that it's that important. But some of the emails that I get that are like, "Oh my God, this changed my life," are not drinking sour or tart orange juice. And so maybe, I don't know, your thoughts on if that's important to emphasize or not?

I don't know. More study would bring out more dangers of eating it. But many of the medical calcium supplements were taken in the form of calcium citrate.

And I think those were doing more harm than good, even though they were getting extra calcium.

Oh, you know what? One last question. Random, but related to sugars. Do you know if they changed the Mexican Coke recipe? Somebody asked that and I thought I didn't think so. And then somebody else who lives here told me that they thought they had. And then upon tasting it now, it kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And so now I kind of think they did. Do you know anything about that?

Nope, I haven't heard anything about it.

So I noticed something similar in the United States. There's a local Latin American store and they're the only ones that are carrying it. Now actually CVS also carries the Mexican Coke, but it's very short on supply. But this local Latin American store has it in cases and I would go there and buy several cases.

I think I was the only one buying it because after a few weeks they ran out and then they replaced it with Guatemalan Coke, which had these paper labels in English pasted on top of the original label. And then that Coke tastes horrifically. It tastes like there's some kind of a metal. It leaves a very strong metallic taste, even though the ingredients listed on the label are the same. Is it a possibility that it has a heavy metal contamination?

Sure. For years, the corn syrup was made with a metal catalyst. Some of it was left in the syrup and so people were being heavy metal poisoned.

Wow, that's terrible. Quick question about the acids. Would other acids that give tart taste such as malic acid or even acidic acid, so malic acid present in unripe apples or grapes, would it also have a potential detrimental chelating effect similar to what you said about citric acid because those are also metabolized in the mitochondria?

Yeah, the ones that have two or three acid groups, citric acid is the most effective chelator, but the double acid molecules can have a chelating action, succinic for example.

But acidic acid is toxic in its own right in excess.

So, does succinic acid, are some countries using it as a drug? I think former Soviet countries sell it as an anti-hangover remedy or something like that.

Anti-what?

Anti-hangover remedy for being able to basically increase the speed of the Krebs cycle.

Oh, I hadn't heard about that, but I've often seen people promoting it for one reason or another, but it is a potentially disruptive, toxic, short-chain, saturated fatty acid.

Yeah, to finish that thought, the Coke tastes more effervescent and there's less of a botanical bite to it. So, what I loved about Coke doesn't seem to be there anymore. So, it's a huge loss.

1939 or 40, when I first tasted Coke, the impression was very herbal. And that was decreased sometime in the late 40s, I think.

Do you think some of the colas, which many other brands are now promoting, and they're trying to mimic the taste and probably even the formula of Coke, because let's face it, rich companies can do a full analysis of the Coke product and probably can come up with a counterfeit product close enough with a bootleg version of it.

Do you know of any other drink that has similar taste/effects to the Mexican Coke that could be obtained from a store?

No, I haven't tried any of the alternatives.

Okay.

Okay, so moving on a little bit to wrap up this dietary stuff. Maybe another part of your, I don't know, nutrition philosophy, I don't know what you want to call it, but is regular consumption of, I'm using air quotes here, but supplemental foods like liver, oysters, and eggs.

The general idea being when you increase the rate of metabolism, not only could that solve nutritional deficiencies, but also you might need more nutrition. Is that right?

Certain things you do need more, but the higher energy metabolism makes you need less of anything. For example, when your thyroid level is proper and your vitamin D, your cells are able to hang on to magnesium.

So a low thyroid person, even supplementing large amounts of magnesium, they will quickly in a week or so become deficient in magnesium on a normal average diet.

But when your thyroid is up, your cells need very little replenishment of magnesium because it's stuck in the cells. But other things, the turnover of carbohydrate and protein have to go up directly with your metabolic rate.

So liver, a rundown of that is the vitamin A, the selenium, the copper, the B vitamins, and then oysters is the zinc, the selenium, the copper, and together those foods fortify a person's nutrition, ameliorating possibly many different dietary deficiencies in two foods. Is that right?

Yes. The idea basically is that it's too complicated to calculate in terms of individual things. It's very satisfying and sort of spectacular when you can bring someone out of a dying state with one nutritional supplement, but most of the time, you don't have that much luck.

So the shotgun effect of eggs and liver and shellfish, it's very important to fill in what you don't know.

I want to talk about liver a little bit more, but is there something about oysters or liver that make them more difficult to digest? Maybe it's the iron content or do you think that's even true?

Yeah, I think it's the low fat content of the liver especially. The high protein gives you strong signals and requires a lot of extra sugar and preferably some saturated fat to go with it to slow down the absorption and make the digestion happen without stress.

And a random question, would you consider liver without gelatin to be risky or is that, you think that's relatively safe?

I just make sure to have lots of butter or other fat and sugar. Ice cream, for example, after eating some liver. Otherwise, I've noticed it disturbs my sleep with hypoglycemia or something.

In terms of oysters, what do you think is a good rule of thumb for how often and how much does a person need to get sufficient amounts of copper and maybe selenium?

For copper and selenium, once a week is enough.

And how much would you eat, like a dozen?

Just probably two or three ounces once a week is enough for those.

Okay. So maybe that's a little bit less than, that's a downward revision maybe, two or three ounces?

Well, it wouldn't hurt to have a big bowl of them, but that's the minimal.

Is there any risk to eating once a week, like having a full meal of nothing but oysters and I don't know, excluding the carbs, would it be a problem to have most of your protein at a dinner meal coming from oysters?

No, considering that the iron content is also very high. You just have to take that into account.

So oysters are high on iron too?

Mm-hmm.

Okay. Super random question, but do you use the Crown Prince ones in olive oil for your oysters?

Yeah, that's what I'm eating the last two or three years.

How do you, or do you, get rid of the olive oil in those?

I would just open the can of crack and drain it thoroughly.

And then super random, but do you have some preparation that you enjoy with the oysters?

Oh, just having it with cheese, cheese and orange juice, makes a really nice meal.

Do you heat them up or do you just kind of eat them out of the can?

Out of the can, cold.

Would heating them actually be a bad idea because of the olive oil?

No.

Good to know. Okay, just wrapping up a bunch of boats on...

I do mine, I use the same brand. I drain the olive oil the same way Ray does, but I basically throw a tablespoon of salt on top of them and then fill up the can with vinegar and then I just eat them like a salad.

Oh, very nice. Yeah, I tend to salt mine or eat them with extremely salty cheese.

Yeah, I found out that if I eat a lot of oysters without enough salt for some reason, just like for you Ray, the liver gave you insomnia, same thing happened to me with the oysters, but if I put enough salt, that doesn't happen, I sleep deeply.

So, just a... go ahead Ray.

Salt and gelatin are both very helpful for good sleep.

Do you have a... keeping with the theme of the show, do you have an amount of salt that you think is maybe necessary for minimal functioning of a person?

No, you can adapt, you can adapt very well. When I worked in the woods, our cook was obsessed with the fact that sweating people needed extra salt because of what they lost and so he put a heaping spoonful in our porridge every morning and then wouldn't give us our ham and eggs and pancakes if we didn't finish our porridge.

And that was... I found that I was... had so much salt in my sweat that it was crystallizing on my glasses during my vision and making my arm hairs crystalline and white and that seemed, besides the awful taste,

I decided over one weekend to tell him that my doctor had put me on a low salt diet, so after that I was the only one who got good porridge in the morning.

And immediately just over the weekend, I had been having to eat salt tablets in the afternoon. After pouring out such concentrated salt water, I would start fainting if I didn't eat salt tablets. And just over the weekend, I didn't need salt tablets in the afternoon. And my sweat was like distilled water.

In 2021, Bill Gates is going to give you vaccines in your porridge instead of the salt. Okay, so wrapping up a few other things here.

One question about salt. There's some recent human studies that claim that anything less than five grams of elemental sodium daily activates chronically the Iranian angiotensin aldosterone system. Would you agree with that?

Oh, for sure. That tiny amount brings up your anxiety and inflammation. So salt is definitely anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory. And a population in Mongolia, for example, the people don't have any problem with hypertension and they eat an average of about 30 grams of salt per day.

Is it one teaspoon, four grams? Is that right?

Four or five.

So at least one teaspoon, basic. So what I said earlier about the 1500 to 2000 milligrams, I know you think even more would be good. Like, what do you think, I don't know, for a specific health problem or the general aging process or anti-stress in 2021, what would you think there's, I don't know, 2500 or 3000? Is that even better?

Yeah, I always get at least 2500 and sometimes 5000 of calcium.

So that'd be like three quarts of milk.

Like a Maasai warrior.

Right, they often get more than that.

That'd be, what, a gallon of milk and then some cheese as well?

Yeah.

And the benefit of getting even more, not only suppressing parathyroid hormone, prolactin, aldosterone, et cetera, but is, what is it, activating those uncoupling mitochondrial proteins?

Yeah, it works with sodium to do that.

Good stuff. Okay, just scanning through to kind of—

Speaking of sodium, because I told Danny I'm going to ask you this question, since all of these electrolytes can sort of partially fill in for each other, do you think lithium can do a lot of these things at much lower amounts that sodium and calcium can do?

I used to call it super sodium from some of its effects, that the body senses a smaller amount of that as a larger amount of sodium. But its effects on serotonin, I think, are a drawback to having much of it in your diet.

Does it decrease the uptake of serotonin or does it increase its production?

Its effects, I think, partly from affecting the retention of it in platelets.

Okay. I'm reading the comments here on this episode right now and somebody's asking about magnesium and the suppression of parathyroid—or I'm actually kind of adding onto their question—but magnesium suppressing the parathyroid hormone versus calcium.

Isn't the magnesium the basic calcium channel blocker? So maybe the calcium going into the cell is part of turning on the parathyroid hormone, but just eating more calcium would be maybe the more straightforward way of lowering parathyroid hormone?

Yeah, that's what has been studied most. Calcium in the diet tending to offset the effect of phosphate.

And magnesium has very parallel effects. I think the combination of a moderate amount of magnesium with calcium, assuming your thyroid is responding properly, is the most effective.

But you wouldn't consider magnesium as like the par excellence PTH inhibitor, would you?

It could be, but I haven't seen enough evidence of that.

But it's also the question of absorption and retention, right? It's calcium that even in a hypothyroid person can be easily absorbed and retained and used to lower PTH, while if you're hypothyroid, you may load up on magnesium all you want, but other than getting diarrhea, you're not going to achieve much, right?

Yeah, and you lose it. Whatever gets in your cells stays there a very short time and is lost quickly.

So there's a reason so many different dietary camps agree on supplementing calcium. They're probably hypometabolic, they're supplementing calcium, and they're losing it and they just have to continuously supplement it.

You mean magnesium?

Magnesium, yeah, I'm sorry.

Yeah, and to some extent calcium goes out as your stress hormones go up.

So some people have reported, especially on various online places, that their blood calcium is at the upper end of the normal range or slightly above, and their doctor is basically telling them, "Oh, we don't know what it's causing. If it's too high, the doctor starts worrying that it's some kind of a tumor, but if it's like slightly elevated, the doctor says, 'I don't know what's causing it, but I wouldn't worry about it.'" What's your take on that?

That you should worry about it.

That you should worry about it, okay.

Yeah, because it's probably decreasing in your bones and increasing in your brain and arteries.

So what do you think may be causing this mild hypercalcemia?

Not enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet, mostly.

Okay. What about high estrogen and cortisol, since they shed the bone as well?

Mm-hmm.

And prolactin probably too, right?

Yeah.

Okay, we'll wrap this up really soon. Unless, Georgia, you have something other to talk about. I just wanted to just quickly reference this. I was reading one of your references, Ray. I can't read the title. It's like too small on my page. It's a paper talking about inflammaging.

And anyways, I thought this was kind of like a breakdown, like a really easy to understand breakdown of all the things we talk about. You say in one of your newsletters, "The weak oxy metabolism and hypothyroidism makes it easy to enter a state of reductive stress with a shift towards a higher concentration of NADH and lactate, dot, dot, dot. And prostaglandins, cytokines, estrogen, and nitric oxide are produced in coordinated ways, and cellular behaviors are changed defensively."

And I looked that up after reading this paper, because the whole point of the paper was saying that, oh man, can I even remember what it was about? The cytokines, I think you've called them a secondary immune system. But the weak oxy metabolism, the shift towards NADH and lactate, and the production of the cytokines in response, this paper was arguing that those are the things that are chronically activating the hypothalamus pituitary adrenals.

The endotoxin is another thing activator. But that, maybe that was, I thought that was great because it kind of clarified things in my brain of how inflammation and stress are these synonymous concepts, and the cytokines are basically activating the stress centers.

Yeah, but the basic thing is the failure of energy or the shift from oxidative to glycolytic energy, and that predisposes you to all of the cytokine problems.

And those are just messengers, like the TNF-alpha and the NFKB, what is it called?

Nuclear factor Kappa B.

Yeah, did the, I mean, I know there's like a thousand of them, but what's your interpretation? They're just sending signals?

Yeah, they're like an amplifying system.

It's saying that the cells are in a bad state.

Yeah. And evoking emergency measures.

Awesome. Okay, Ray, we'll let you go in a second here. What are you working on right now?

I'm still working on the adaptation based on cell learning, epigenetics as learning, not as a euphemism for non-genetic, but epigenetics as a continuous process of learning and adaptation.

And following that, I think it's going to be how the estrogen system works, especially in breast and prostate cancer, and so what can be done to intervene in those deteriorating inflammatory estrogenic processes.

Man, that was such a good conversation. I'm embarrassed I didn't mention Progest-E by Keenogen. So email Catherine to purchase Progest-E, keenogen@gmail.com.

Each bottle contains, Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

And usually, Ray, I ask you about a story of progesterone, but I have one this week.

Somebody I've talked to for a long period of time that's tried many, many, many, many different things. They on their own started taking, and they're a male, obviously, they started taking 200 milligrams of progesterone.

And I talked to them and they said one of the things that was chronically haunting them was their milk allergy, and then it went away when they were taking the 200 milligrams of progesterone.

So obviously, you've mentioned that before, and so I thought that was in like miracle territory, because this person has tried so many different things.

Very good to hear.

Well, the progesterone is inducing the lactase enzyme, is that right?

It does what?

It's inducing the lactase, among other things.

Yeah, like thyroid. It helps to bring up the digestive enzymes.

Awesome, and then you can email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com to get Ray's books that I have here.

And then you can also email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com for $28 for a bi-monthly newsletter by Ray.

And so with that, let me read these donations, which I will send directly to Ray.

And let me just try to mess with my screen here.

This is a chronic problem every single time.

Okay, the first donation I can't read. This is embarrassing.

Okay, Kyle Mamounis for $199. Thank you so much, Kyle.

Michelle for $50. Thank you so much, Michelle.

I think there are more donations. This is very embarrassing, guys. I can't read the donations.

Anyways, I guess we'll have to read them next time.

So with that, Georgie, any parting words?

Not really. Like I said, unplug and live your life.

The system depends entirely on your computer to manipulate you.

Ray, same with you. Parting words?

Yeah, start learning Spanish. You'll have more fun.

But just to touch on that for a second, didn't you say something like you could go work out or you could go learn a language and that would activate a different part of the nervous system?

And so that was something constructive a person could do?

Yeah, I think it's more constructive to learn another language.

Awesome. Ray, thank you so much. These are always really fun to do. Georgie Dinkov, thank you for being my partner in crime.

I sincerely appreciate it. And thank you, everybody watching this. Thank you for watching in the future.

We're on Odyssey, BitChute, Spotify for as long as those venues will have us.

And so subscribe to those other ones or the Telegram or whatever.

Thank you, Ray Peat. Thank you, Georgie Dinkov. Thank you to our great audience.

We'll see you guys next week. I think, Georgie, I haven't even told you, but we're going to do a show next week, I think.

Okay. Okay. Everybody take care. Have a safe weekend. We'll talk to you guys soon. Bye, everybody.

Thanks. Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

[BLANK_AUDIO]Okay, normally I would say Georgie Dinkov and Ray Peat, but we only have Ray today.

Georgie, hopefully he'll come and we'll work him into what's going on, but it's just going

to be a chat between Ray and I. How are you, Ray?

Very good.

Okay, so immediately before we talked about your newsletter, I wanted to get into, I felt

like I kind of approached the nutrition topic a little bit off center on the last episode.

I thought it was good, but I thought my questions to you were kind of holding you up like an

authority and it wasn't conscious. I wasn't trying to do it, but I was unimpressed with

my questions to you. So maybe, I don't know, is there anything you can think of that would

kind of broaden the scope of what we were talking about last time in terms of approaching

nutrition? And of course that will probably lead right into your new newsletter.

Well, nutrition is as complex and open and undefined as metaphysics or cosmology or anything.

It's a process of exploring and learning and figuring things out. And so it's never a closed

book, never a finished subject.

What is the problem with authoritarianism in nutrition? Like if somebody says, "Oh, Ray

Peat says to eat 100 grams of protein and 200 grams of carbohydrate," like what does

that negate from the individual trying to figure things out?

Everything is always changing and always individual and always changed by context. And so what's

true for one person today, where they are will necessarily be somewhat different when

they're in a different place doing different things. It's always looking at your problems

immediately in your context and to understand those, it helps to look at your history, how

you got to where you are and what you want to do to get beyond the present. So all the

dimensions have to be flexible. And so your digestive system reflects the things you've

done in the past. Your whole being is taking form, assimilating things you've experienced

and intend to experience. So you have to think of yourself as an intended participant in

everything, including your choices of foods.

Well, given how complex everything is and everything's a moving target, like how do

you even approach the subject?

With what you've been doing and how it has worked for you. If you've been living on sweet

potatoes and pork fat and you're doing okay in the middle age, then you don't see much

need for a change.

But what if somebody was grown up eating cereal and fruit snacks? What would...

They probably wouldn't have grown up very much.

Oh no, that's me.

So would the context change if somebody's writing you an email and saying, "Hey Ray,

I have a low pulse rate, a low temperature, high cholesterol, constipation." Is that what

makes the suggestions in context with what the person is explaining?

Yeah. All those things point to hypometabolism, low thyroid function.

And then, okay, so if you're saying something like protein, carbohydrate, calcium, et cetera,

you're giving those facts to that person and then it's up to them, like we talked about

last time, the creative act of conversation and then that person assimilating the info

and trying to extract something out of it that means something to them in their life.

Yeah, because their digestive system is going to have its unique oddities and it might turn

out that the high protein diet that would quickly cure someone if they already have

a sensitivity to serotonin and tryptophan, for example, they might have to work into

that very carefully with a diet emphasizing more gelatin than the highest quality proteins.

And then when somebody says, emails you and says, "I'm doing the Ray Peat diet," what

is your... what do you think of that?

First, I ask them what they're eating.

So you automatically assume that that was... so just to be completely honest here, so I

told you that I don't like that term, and I used to edit it out of podcasts, but it

has gained a lot of traction. But you think even using that term, I'm not saying you think

this, but it's probably kind of to really reduce your work into silly territory, saying

something like Ray Peat diet, you think?

Pretty much. From what I hear, people are eating on the Ray Peat diet. At least, it

usually excludes eating a lot of bread and green salads and beans. But those are, I think,

a few of the things that people generally realize can be harmful.

Maybe you could critique my approach, but I feel like when I chat with a lot of people,

there's always diet stuff, but it almost seems like if they're talking to me, it's past the

point of no return with dietary intervention. Is that a bad orientation to have? Because

usually they'll have labs as well, and I think the person will generally be kind of at the

end of the road. They'll have tried veganism or low carb or carnivore or et cetera, et

cetera, et cetera.

And I'm almost inclined to suggest the vitamin D to read hypothyroidism, the unsuspected

illness to get into thyroid and stuff. And of course, doing the dietary interventions.

But I don't know, could you say after 20 or 25 that a person is like, I'm sure you could

say earlier, but that it's very hard to get the metabolic rate going just with food alone?

Oh yeah. Almost everyone benefits from adding a little bit of thyroid. The human diet historically

probably always included some supplemental animal thyroid, whether it came from chicken,

stew, or fish soup, or sausages, or even blood. There was always some supplement coming from

their food. And since 1940, that has been legally banned from the American food supply

and pretty much other industrialized countries imitating the US requiring slaughterhouses

to take out the thyroid glands. And people generally just don't eat the blood. It's sort

of a taboo. While countries that save the blood and make tacos out of it or something

are getting a little bit of extra hormones of various types.

Something I've noticed, and I don't know if you feel the same, but there's something

about thyroid that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with. They'll take progesterone

or DHEA or pregnenolone, or they'll even be taking other supplements like ashwagandha

or rhodiola or just you name it. But thyroid is a lot of crossing the line to a lot of

people.

I think the drug companies and the doctors that have been educated under their influence

are responsible for that. The same thing that caused the agriculture department to order

slaughterhouses to remove it from the food supply. Broda Barnes tells some of the stories,

for example, in the 1930s, he observed that thyroid deficiency, among other things, caused

an extremely high rate of heart attacks and circulatory disease, infectious diseases,

circulatory diseases and cancer were the main killers in a hypothyroid population.

But when he started popularizing that, there was a reaction and JAMA published a story

about a doctor who had given a patient who had just suffered a massive heart attack a

supplement of, I think, two grains of Armour thyroid starting right off on a full standard

dose rather than working into it over a period of weeks and the patient died. And so that

created the propaganda that natural thyroid could kill you with a heart attack. And that

sort of thing was amplified when the Synthroid, I think, was the first one on the market with

a synthetic thyroxine product. I was in junior high around that time and there were several

fat kids and most of the kids already at that time were seeing doctors regularly and almost

simultaneously two or three of my fat friends said that they didn't have a hormone problem,

they were just gluttons. That had been taught to the doctors who taught it to their overweight

patients. And that went with doctors ordering their patients to stop taking thyroid. If

an old empirical doctor had recognized that people with chronic infections or obesity

or any of the 30 or so classical symptoms of hypothyroid, if people had been doing well

taking Armour thyroid, they went to the modern update, the well-trained doctors told them

to stop taking it because it was dangerous.

As I say, in obesity, is the part of the look of obesity just that accumulation of mucopolysaccharides?

Yeah, usually it is. It's a mixture of Cushing's symptoms, high stress hormones of various

sorts and they can go in the direction of high estrogen or high serotonin or high histamine,

high cortisol, high aldosterone, imbalance of the androgens, many different hormonal

directions just because your thyroid is not giving you the energy to contextualize your

physiology to round everything off.

I'm searching for it right now. I'm sure I will not be able to find it, but I feel like

one of the most important things you've ever said that really helped me clarify my extremely

blurry picture of physiology is you said when your thyroid is low, your pituitary doesn't

have much to do and your ovaries don't have much to do either and all the glands in your

body have an easy job when your thyroid is high.

I appreciated that so much because if you listen to other people in the health world,

it's so ridiculously complicated to figure out, "Okay, where does LH and growth hormone

and prolactin and FSH?" It's incomprehensible without a model that you've put together of

the energy stress. When the energy is low, the activation of the stress systems happens.

I think it's helpful to have in mind a mental image of a libertarian world or an anarchist

society in which everyone knows what to do and how to take care of themselves. That's

when energy is abundant and your thyroid is good. When the well-distributed energy availability

isn't there, then you have to look to be pushed to do what you're supposed to be doing. That's

where the thyroid, the pituitary comes in. The pituitary is roused in proportion to how

everything is failing. It pushes you this way and that way to make up for what you should

be doing just on the basis of your cellular needs and cellular knowledge.

Little W.D. Denkla, you weren't kidding. I feel like you've integrated his work so well.

All the papers were perfectly in sync with what you were saying. I was really shocked

when I got a hold of a couple of them.

Yeah, it's funny how he just disappeared from the world of knowledge.

He's sent to the backwoods maybe? What was it, Dave McCarron, the calcium hypertension

dude?

Yeah.

Let's take a small break here. Ray Peat is on the line with me. Georgie, I'm not sure

where he is. I hope he's okay. Ray, your newsletter is available by email, Ray Peat's newsletter.

Yeah, this issue isn't quite ready. I sent you a draft of it, but I'm still working on

it.

Awesome. People can subscribe to your newsletter by sending $28 to raypeats, with an S, newsletter

at gmail.com. Is that right?

Right.

Then they can send that same email address. They can send any of the titles of your books

for that. We'll talk about Progesthe a little bit later, I think. You know what? We never

talked about those videos surfacing on the back of a tiger. Did you think anything about

those videos being released on YouTube?

I haven't listened to the whole thing that you sent me. I've heard enough recording.

I thought they were good. A lot of people really were excited to see you in action.

I think that brings a different element to it. If that movie has done something good,

it's released those videos. Those were fun to listen to.

Then before we pass by this whole subject, I hope I'm not embarrassing you or anything,

but I think people shouldn't eat things that damage them and should eat things that taste

good and that provide the essential nutrients while making them feel good and function well.

Is that a diet? Is there anything left to speak about that in such an authoritarian

nutrition world? Even your stupid apprentice is misinterpreting things as well. Any room

to clarify?

I'm okay with that as a statement that what tastes good is very important. Your impulses,

your needs very often are responsible for what you're eating. But if you're supplied

with something not quite like what you need, then your taste might cause you to do something

like overeating on sugar or salt. Your cravings are biologically logical, but if the way you

are led to satisfy your cravings is abnormal, then your body might be tricked into malfunctioning

even though it's following its impulses. When your thyroid function is low, your blood

sugar becomes unstable, and so you tend to crave sweets and alternatively salt, which

helps you to use the glucose efficiently. But if you're mixed foods that would supply

those needs, if they're very distorted, then you might not correct the problem by following

your instincts. So you have to use your other perceptions and thought processes to figure

out just what it is your body is telling you to do.

What was that H.G. Wells quote? It's like, "Nature never appeals to intellect unless

intuition fails." Or what was it? Something else fails? Your instincts? Instincts fail.

Just before we get comments, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm just joking, everybody.

Okay. But one thing is, could somebody be in such a bad place that their orienting reflex

and intuition is just so jaded and blurry that, for lack of a better word, or suggesting

something to them is... Would that still be kind of a bad situation? How would you approach

something like that?

People tend to be immersed in the forces of their authoritarian surroundings. The culture

that they have integrated is telling them to do certain things, like go to the doctor

if you feel sick. If your body doesn't play a role in those cultural instructions, then

you'll go to the doctor, go to your job, maybe go to church, do whatever the culture prescribes,

and ignore what your body is telling you. But anyone can start to listen to themselves.

When they are mentally hearing instructions, a conscience telling them what they should

be doing, if they listen carefully, they'll be able to detect the source of where that

instruction is coming from. The guru, I don't know what he was officially called, but George

Gurdjieff, his basic principle was "Remember yourself." That really meant looking at what

your body impulses are doing and put that into conjunction with what your environment

is ordering you to do. Like you call up an image of who is speaking the instructions

to you, and then check how that image and set of instructions goes with your heart plexus

and your solar plexus, and check out what it does to your body. Usually you feel a shrinking,

compressed feeling in your body when you hear those conscience voices speaking to you.

I feel the opposite when I eat a churmoya. You said G.I. Gurdjieff, right? Is that the

guru?

Yeah.

He has a quote, "Without self-knowledge, without understanding the working and functions

of his machine, man cannot be free and he cannot govern himself, and he will always

remain a slave."

Yeah, that's pretty solid.

Okay, great stuff. I'm a little bit, is trepidatious the right word, to get into your

newsletter because it's such a dense newsletter. I'd love to be able to summarize it, but

I wouldn't do it justice. I guess, what was your motivation for writing it specifically?

It was sort of a shotgun approach to explaining a general approach. Like a mosaic, you put

down a lot of the material that is going to make up the image, and you hope that when

you get enough of the material together, you'll recognize what adds up, the general meaning.

So it's just a collection of these last 120 years, or 200 years actually, of observations

about how organisms work and how they might work. And then looking at the very clear experiments,

showing definitely that they don't work in certain ways and do work in other ways that

have been ignored, such as the purpose and intentionality of single-celled organisms

all the way down to bacteria, making decisions and planning and changing their behavior according

to what they perceive the environment to require. If bacteria can do it, why can't a human brain

cell do something at least partly as competent as that? I think the culture has created partly

to instill a helpless attitude in the public, has created this doctrine that our brain cells

are among the stupidest of all parts of creation. They can only signal by on and off information,

yes or no, nothing, approaching the infinite judgment ability that bacteria or planaria

or amoebas display.

Something that reminded me of something is like, everybody has their desired outcome

for society or how we should organize ourselves, but the gist I get from you is that that hasn't

even been an optimal way of doing that, hasn't even been approached, or maybe it has slightly

with Marxism or something, but like an environment that actually supported our physiology or

biology or whatever hasn't even been broached yet.

Yeah, that's someone like Kropotkin put together biology and culture and politics into a single

picture.

And there's something you mentioned in this article that I haven't thought about for a

long time is the primary, how do you say that, psyllium? And that's like a little, you call

it sensing organelle or something on the cell?

Yeah, like our retinal cells have this little finger tip, it's like a psyllium except it

doesn't wiggle. It internally resonates with what's impinging upon it, and that resonance

is made available to the connecting nervous system. Same with the ear or the olfactory

nerves or the touch movement detectors all through the body. Each brain cell even has

its own little antenna tuning it into the environmental conditions.

Okay, so we're going to pause really quickly. Ray, I'm actually going to hang up on you.

I'm going to call Georgie, then I'm going to call you back, and I'm going to pause the

screen everybody. And so you guys will be hearing music and we'll get Georgie on the

line. Is that okay, Ray?

Okay.

Okay, so I'll call you back in one or like two minutes or so. Okay.

Okay.

Okay. Bye, Ray. Okay, hang on everybody. Okay, Georgie, we're live. Ray, we're live. Okay.

So there's Georgie. Everybody, this was probably my mistake. And so apologies to Georgie, I

think I told you the wrong time. Okay. So Georgie, we were going through, first we kind

of talked about nutrition. We got all that out of my system, which I need to talk about.

And then we're now we're going through Ray's newsletter. We just talked about the cilium,

the sensing organelle of the cell. And Ray, what are some of the other critical things

in this newsletter that you feel like are very important?

That's the theme that comes back over and over is the conscious purpose of each of the

component cells. Like the hologram idea is that conscious memories are not localized

in any part of the tissue, but people like Carl Preblum was the outstanding figure in

that line of thinking that the cortex through a network of synapses is able to make a hologram

that records awareness images in a non-localized hologram manner. And that is still limited

by the discrete nature of synaptic individual action, even though the pattern imposed on

that network of synaptic conditions or states, even though that's holographic, the underlying

substance of the brain function that Preblum advocated was still the old-fashioned behaviorist

mechanical on/off nerve cell is nothing but a switch-like conveyor of yes or no information

rather than something transmitting the complex image-like perceptions of each of the cells,

receptor cells or the nerve cells themselves containing a primary cilium in addition to

messages they're getting from other nerve cells. So it's trying to show that everything

that denies the complete participation of every cell in our conscious purposeful activity,

everything that denies that is based on an arbitrary assumption, which ultimately is

a false assumption that leads to behaviorism and mechanism and reductionism.

I have a question about holograms. Can a group of organisms, regardless of species, can sort

of band together and form a super hologram that combines their consciousness into sort

of like the collective consciousness that we all talk about?

Yeah, if they are sensitive and care to tune in to their surroundings, if they put their

primary cilium in contact with the draining cytoplasm, then they should be able to pick

up the whole worldview and metaphysics of whoever they're touching.

Do you think that may explain the ancestral memories and people having visions and contacts

with people that have been dead for a long time? Basically, they're like re-materializing

that portion of that collective consciousness.

Yeah, I think it's important not to rule out anything, not to assume limits to awareness

that aren't based on some kind of real evidence.

So maybe that could also explain Carl Jung's idea of the archetypes. These visions are

simply people connecting to the collective consciousness and extracting information from

it.

Yeah, and Michael Persinger's view that the resonant electromagnetic fields of the

earth and of our brain are coordinated, resonating with each other. And so brain-to-brain, by

way of the earth's resonant chamber.

Ray, you point out how things are fluid and changing all the time, but in the Cosmic Clocks

book, if he's right and the seasons are imbuing people with an essence or something,

isn't that something that's not really changing that much?

Oh, sure. Gravity and all of those things, the absolute meaning of a certain frequency

of vibratory energy, each thing has its intrinsic qualities. Every substance has its unique

identity. So the surroundings are part of your identity at any moment. The de-abstraction

of consciousness means that our being in its concreteness takes into account and assimilates

everything around us, including the state of the sun and the planets and the earth and

other people in that system.

So if two people are born in the same month, they might have a similar vibration, is that

right?

Yeah, they are more closely attuned to certain ideas and patterns. That's all it means,

but that's a lot.

You think that may explain part of astrology and the planets?

Yeah, that's what the Cosmic Clock, Gokulen, Michel Gokulen.

Where does that idea go off the rails, though? I'm so stupid. What's the thing that people

read? They're horoscopes. Is there some point at which it becomes total nonsense?

Yeah, but that's just a literary genre. It can be interesting, but it's just a person

creating a cultural artifact that to some extent recognizes that we are in the cosmos

together.

Well, here's a question. If you were going to spend your life with somebody, would the

month that they were born in matter to you?

I don't know. I think the clash of frequencies might make it more interesting than too much

harmony of frequencies.

There's an optimal antagonism, so to speak, contrarianism that a lifetime partner should

provide, otherwise it becomes boring if they're too harmonized.

That is sort of my impression, that you want to be able to go off independently and come

back and keep renewing others with your odd and idiosyncratic learnings.

The Chinese have a proverb that love is not so much gazing harmoniously into each other's

eyes, but it's about two people looking together in a similar direction.

I thought I had said that.

Okay, then it's a resonance, I guess, across time. Somebody may have plagiarized it off

of your website and then presented it as a Taoist saying from the 6th century or something.

Okay, well, how about we talk about Progesty and then we'll get into some questions because

we have some really excellent questions, I think.

I have one more question related to collective consciousness and Rupert Sheldrake. I don't

know if you saw, he did a famous experiment with another person who was a contrarianist

that it's impossible to have a collective learning experience and extracting collective

knowledge from the ether. And then they did this experiments, I think, with chicks, they

were training them. And then each successive generation of little chicks was able to learn

faster and faster a new task. So is there anything special that's required in order

to be able to tune in into that collective consciousness and knowledge, like a fast metabolism?

Are things that interfere with that process? In other words, making you more and more isolated

from the collective consciousness?

Yeah, I think everything metabolic and neurological affects it. Do you know who Andrea Puharich

was? Henry or Andrea was his first name, but Puharich wrote a couple of books exploring

what it is that opens the consciousness to remote viewing, for example. And he got the

Pentagon involved and interested in it. But he was seeing it in terms of a balance between

the parasympathetic and sympathetic system in a context that I think Michael Persinger

comes the closest to explaining how these nervous system balances could be operating.

He saw when people were asleep or extremely relaxed, he imagined that their nervous system

is able to sort of extend its feelers out without regard to distance, for example, tuning

into the Earth's resonance. But during anxiety, there's a contraction and everything tends

to fall towards the anxious center. And so if a person is in the sleep or relaxed parasympathetic

state, their feelers are out. And if someone related to them is in a crisis, anxiety state

of androdermic dominance, their relaxed feelers will be drawn to tune in and focus on that

center of crisis or anxiety or despair. And I think that might be where Michael Persinger

took up his basic orientation of Andrea Puharich was writing in the 50s and 60s.

I thought the Pentagon was also using LSD to drug some of the remote viewers and see

if that enhances the performance.

What do you think...

Mushrooms too.

Mushrooms too.

How did you materialize from that research? How do you think it was applied? Do you know

anything about that?

There are several videos of some of the people who were involved working for the Pentagon-related

research centers, like the Stanford Research Institute. They have their personal experience

statements in videos that I think are worth watching.

Maybe they transitioned to Project Blue Beam for a fake alien invasion?

Say that again?

I said, maybe they transitioned to Project Blue Beam for a fake alien invasion?

Oh, oh.

I'm just joking.

Have you seen the news lately? They're always coming out of the Pentagon saying more and

more UFO sightings, something big is about to happen and everybody's glued to their TV,

which I guess is the goal, right? As long as they're not rioting.

I think it has served as a distraction for a long time.

Okay, well, let's get into these questions because they're... Oh, let's talk about progesterone

first. Ray, do you have any stories that you can grasp in your large bag of amazing stories

about progeste that we can talk about?

Oh, about any subject you want to apply it to. Dementia, epilepsy, sunburn, traumatic

injury, chronic conditions of all sorts, arthritis, asthma, pimples, acne, all kinds of stress.

Conditions on all the cellular levels, everything from personality problems all the way down

to whether a cell is inflamed.

This isn't directly related to progesterone, but a quote of yours that I sent to a lot

of people is, I forgot what newsletter it was, but you say something like, "Using progesterone

alone is not a good approach." You have to figure out what the problem is and usually

that's related to low thyroid function. So if a problem isn't miraculously solved by

progesterone, thyroid was probably the next thing to investigate.

Yeah. If you think you're dying of a migraine or a seizure, progesterone itself, a good

dose of that can very quickly bring you out of the problem, but then you have to figure

out what it was that put you into that unstable condition that needed progesterone.

And then last thing on this, some people are saying like, "If your nutrition is so good,

why do you need to add hormones?" And maybe a good response to that would be, "Our environment

is so terribly awful that maybe just even taking thyroid isn't enough kind of defense

from kind of the onslaught of metabolic problems we're faced with day to day."

Yeah. Even thyroid and milkshakes and quesadillas aren't always enough to make up for the horrors

that are imposed on us and some of the natural defects of the environment. Like we probably

should live more like naked mole rats sleeping in burrows in family clusters where we would

be producing a proper amount of carbon dioxide so that we would be soaked in carbon dioxide

for a good part of our lives, making up for the natural imbalance created by geological

changes.

I read a book recently about how people, the difference in sleep between these days and

back in the Middle Ages, and apparently people back then were sleeping in barnyards with

animals, 15 to 20 people all huddled together. And I guess the rate of degenerative disease,

maybe that's one reason why it was much lower. They were living like naked mole rats.

Yeah, having a cow and a pig in the house when you're asleep.

Makes life more fun.

You completely stole that out of my brain. I was going to make a joke about Ray, a long

time ago you said like an optimal society would include our animal friends and I was

going to make a joke about that and then you said it, Georgie, that's really wild.

That's how they used to live apparently. I mean, it was a book on anthropology. I don't

remember the author names right now, but he said that our current mode of life is drastically

different and judging from the archaeological findings and the examinations they did on

bones and whatever records, other records they could unearth, that he's saying that

apparently their lifestyle was conducive to much better health. They didn't have these

diseases back then.

Yeah, and I think carbon dioxide is always a basic factor of stress relief or stress

production depending on the concentration.

I have a question. Difference between thyroid and progesterone. Is there anything thyroid

does uniquely that progesterone either completely does not do or is much weaker or less capable

of achieving?

Yeah, the mitochondrial, you can uncouple the mitochondria by increasing your thyroid

temporarily to shift the ratio towards carbon dioxide from lactate and progesterone tends

to stabilize the mitochondria in an efficient, well-coupled condition. So like to get rid

of moles or skin cancers or such, a temporary, officially overdose of thyroid hormone. I've

seen fairly large uterine fibroids, for example, when someone was willing to stay slightly

hyperthyroid, keeping a resting pulse around 110 for three months, a large fibroid would

shrink permitting a pregnancy to proceed. And the same with getting rid of other types

of tumors and things that require corrective adjustments of the tissues.

So I thought that progesterone is thermogenic. Wouldn't that imply that it also uncouples

to a degree?

I think it achieves it by reducing loss as much as by maintaining, preventing the bypass

of the mitochondria. Keeps the mitochondria going efficiently, but at the same time, it's

reducing nitric oxide in the skin and preventing unwanted heat loss.

Okay, great stuff. Okay, so this is our first question. And the person quotes Heraclitus

and the quote is "Polymethy does not teach intelligence of things." And then their question

is "Much learning does not teach understanding. You can't really know something unless you

experience it. Are Ray's thoughts analogous to this?"

Yeah, you have to at least imagine experiencing it. The typical way of indoctrination and

school learning is by way of formulas rather than at least an imagined experience. And

literature and art should teach you, get your nervous system in the habit of thinking experientially

rather than in terms of algorithms and rote formulas.

Do you think the sterilization of learning, in other words, everybody's been turning

to not just a bookworm, but a very, what should I call it, rigid bookworm, may account for

the fragmentation of society? Basically, everybody's learned, but nobody really knows much about

the real world these days.

Yeah, true kind of learning always takes into account our world in common. And so that is

always an essential aspect of any little thing that you might know, how to play a music instrument

or how to make a fancy horse saddle or how to build a building. It always has to take

into account the overall world that we have in common.

So basically by preventing people from having common experiences, they essentially guarantee

that we can understand each other no matter how much we read about each other.

Yeah.

Great stuff. Okay, this one says, "Does Ray believe that some principles are worth dying

for?"

No.

I knew you were going to say that. Why?

Who wrote the principle? Whose principle is it? You have to look at the metaphysics behind

the principle. Make sure it isn't based on false assumptions and false metaphysics.

Would, so dying as an alternative to getting a vaccine is not rational?

Is there a connection?

Well, so say a hypothetical thing where it was like death or getting a vaccine. Despite

the horrors of getting a vaccine, killing yourself or something would not be a reasonable

option.

No.

Yeah.

It's better to be wounded and deformed by the vaccine than to be dead.

I was going to say war is, what is it? The expression is war is old man talking and young

man dying. So if somebody else wrote the principle, I'm with Ray on this one that you want to

be very careful whose principles you're trying to die for.

Right. So often there's an evil ulterior motive behind the principle.

Just to play devil's advocate, what about the phrase like, "Some things are worse than

death"? Like what if life was so much suffering after getting maimed by a vaccine?

I think your organism takes care of that. The stress hormones rise to the point that

it simply finishes off all of the processes.

I want to go on to this next question. What's like the, you know how W.D. Denkla was trying

to search for the death hormone. Do you feel like you figured out anything that he did

not figure out?

Oh yeah. There's no death hormone. It's just the death struggle of the organism against

these bad environmental problems.

And perceiving that there's no progress, right? Because if it's a great struggle but the organism

senses that there's progress, then this can actually, this shouldn't necessarily lead

to death.

No, no. Those processes are really last ditch survival attempts. The zooming up of your

growth hormone and prolactin and corticotropin, all of those are well-meaning survival attempts.

But they just accelerate all of the poor adaptations we're making to an inadequate environment.

Is death like, so those pituitary hormones are increasing, but maybe they cause prolonged

hypoxia and that leads to death? Is that right?

Well all of our adaptations are to a detective environment to one degree or another. If you

have to change your physiology to fit into the environment, the bigger those changes

are, the more your pituitary hormones are involved and the more it's diverting you from

what you would really like to be doing. And so the growth hormone has potential benefit,

but when you're forced to keep secreting it along with ACTH and serotonin and so on, the

outcome wasn't intended. But what it means is that you have adapted yourself, for example,

secreting more and harder insoluble collagen, turning yourself sort of into a tanned piece

of leather.

Saddle.

It makes you tough in a sense that can stand up to the environment a little longer, but

it isn't a good adaptive course to take. If we can improve the environment, have very

good nutrition, very good carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, a good amount of temperature and

sunlight and so on, then we can start mobilizing our intentional adaptive processes and in

that environment, the effort to adapt and become something else, you will tend to dissolve

the hardened collagen, remove the calcium from the soft tissues, put it back in your

bones and reconstruct a living vital organism. So the adaptive intention in a bad environment

leads you into degeneration. In a good environment, it leads you to restoration.

I was going to say, like three or four years ago, there was a doctor and he linked something

on Twitter and it was an article on fasting increasing growth hormone. And he tweeted,

"This is what Ray Peat does not understand." And he was inferring like the fasting was

increasing the growth hormone and you want to increase your growth hormone. And I just

had a little chuckle. Okay, next question.

The recent study on reversing the aging of the human immune system, they specifically

administered DHEA to block the aging, the pro-aging hormones of growth hormone. And

I strongly suspected the benefits that they saw from these treatments were actually due

to the DHEA, but it still pays off that they actually were aware that growth hormone has

strongly pro-aging effects. So you may want to send him this article or reply to his tweet

because it's pretty recent. It's from last year and it was in humans.

Great stuff. I will do. Okay, so let's get to this next one. What is it about Aristotle

that makes him a good scientist and what of his methods did the medieval scholastics fail

to adopt?

The idea of becoming, I think he took seriously Heraclitus' basic view of the world as everything

being in process. So I see Aristotle as a Heraclitian process philosopher, totally breaking

away from the platonic essentialism of an abstract finished universe. So he didn't have

a good data collection system, maybe the best in the world at the time, but it wasn't adequate

to create 20th century physics quite.

I remember an old interview, maybe it was John Berkhausen and he was like, "Ray, why

do you think William Blake was so smart and you said he didn't go to school?" Is there

a similar thing for Aristotle? Is there any way you can figure out how he knew so much

or his good orientation?

No.

Okay, fair enough. Okay, Georgie, interrupt me at any time. But okay, this is the next

one from Steve. He says, "How does the intangible of stress become a tangible phenomenon in

the cell? Where does it start?"

Reduction of energy, I think, is the general thing. Not getting enough energy to do what

it needs to adapt. And so it sends out signals that want more energy and that turns on emergency

organismic level processes like making more ACTH and cortisol to bring up the blood sugar

and get past the temporary crisis. But the cell ultimately needs to improve its use of

oxygen and glucose to properly restore the energy it needs.

Just a note, thanks for that, Ray. Just a note, all the super chats or super stickers

or whatever they're called will be donated to Ray. So just to let you guys know. Thank

you, Ray. Okay, this next one, we are going through these. Okay, it says, "How does Dr.

Peat organize his reading and research? Given he reads across various topics but is able

to put disparate yet related things together, does he have some sort of note-taking system

basically?"

Okay, you get the point. How do you organize your research, Ray?

I don't. My notes over the years are the most disorganized thing you can imagine. Occasionally,

they're helpful to remind me where I was, but definitely not like having a card file

of things that I've read, but just going from one thing that interests me to another.

Okay, just a minute. So this is shocking to me. So when somebody emails you about something

and then you reply to them and then you attach like eight abstracts, you're going to PubMed

and finding those abstracts or what?

Yeah, some of them I've put into my computer over the years for different reasons, but

usually I find things on PubMed that will answer a person's questions. Even though I

consider PubMed to be largely a propaganda source, it's a leaky propaganda source.

I want to second that, Ray's method over the years have struggled with many different methods

and eventually realized that the only thing that really worked was effectively acting

like a child, just following whatever interests you at the current moment in time. And at

least for me, synchronicity seems to play a big role. Things that I'm reading currently,

somehow miraculously in a few minutes later, I find other things that pop up that they're

disparate but similar, to use the quote from the person. Have you noticed the same thing,

Ray? That if you're reading on a certain topic, basically a similar concept will pop up in

another article, in another source of information, without you actually searching for it?

Yep. That contributes to my basic view of how the brain and the universe work. That

there's sort of a magic synchronicity, probably just because it seems like synchronicity or

magic just because we aren't clearly aware of the mechanisms that make it happen.

Have you noticed that children's play is structured very similarly? They basically base everything

quite naturally based on interest, right? They're not being told what to do when they're

little, and their attention shifts pretty quickly, but they always seem to be heavily

engaged into what they're doing, almost as if in a state of meditation.

Yeah. And with kids, their choices of foods tend to work the same way. They'll eat a lot

of something once and then maybe not touch it again for a month, but they're responding

to something in their physiology. And I think that is true in their play. There's something

in their physiology that wants to be developed as a true play.

So have you had similar experiences as an adult with food, which is related to the next

question that I think Danny is going to read? In other words, sometimes you eat a lot of

something and then the next week you encounter the same thing and you're like, "Eh, I

don't really feel like eating at all."

Yeah. I think it works the same in adults sometimes, but more often in children.

Georgie, can you push your microphone back a little bit? It's for some reason clipping

a little bit. Like, no, not close to you, farther away.

Oh, okay. Like this?

Yeah. Or if you move the actual unit a little bit back. Yeah. Okay, good. Thanks for that.

Okay. So speaking of that question, so this person made sure to clarify and they said

they weren't asking this so they could copy you. They were just curious. And so this person

says, "Can Ray go over what his past week of eating has looked like? Meal examples,

new preferences and tastes, or new experiments with food/meal ideas?"

They tend to cycle. Today, so far, I've had an omelet, milk, orange juice, and coffee,

and then some leftover mushroom soup and carrot salad and orange juice and coffee for the

afternoon. Yesterday, I had an appetite for a cheese taco, a toasted taco with melted

cheese on it. And it just is what I feel I have an appetite for that particular day.

I think our last chat with you increased tortilla sales by like 1,000% all over the world.

Ray, you're responsible for the inflation of food we're seeing all over the US.

I noticed that many years ago when I discovered that the Safeway store was selling chicken

necks at something like a dollar a pound. And I found two or three thyroid glands in

every package, a couple of pounds of necks. I mentioned that in my nutrition classes and

never saw a package of necks again. They constantly were buying them up and then Safeway stopped

selling them, I guess, when the word got out that they contained thyroid glands.

You've got to be careful about those liver sources and other things that you need to

feel well. Yeah, for sure. Okay, next question here. And then I was interested in, after

these questions, asking you some things just about, of course, the culture stuff that we

always go over, but I thought this would be a nice break from just getting questions from

Georgie and I. Okay, where ... Now I've lost my place in these questions. Thanks everybody

for watching. Give this episode a like. Again, all super chats or super stickers or whatever

are donated to Ray. And sincere appreciation for Ray and Georgie being here and taking

their time to do this for everybody. Okay, building off of the idea that when thyroid

is functioning properly, you can think any way you want to about anything. Can you explain

more about the physiological aspects of how our energetic state influences our thoughts

and perception? Is there an energetic component to thoughts that matches biological energy,

or is it more so that a higher energetic state ... And I think I clipped this question, but

you get the idea. Yeah, I think the high energy state is a

relaxed state of readiness. The infant brain with a very high metabolic rate easily goes

into complete relaxed sleep and replenishes its energy so it's ready for another episode

of very intense activity. That kind of episodic energy burst, I think, tend to give you an

image-oriented kind of chunky approach to reality and the problems you're thinking of

rather than just doggedly assembling bits and constructing a knowledge system out of

learned bits. It gives you an animal quality to your episodes of learning and thinking.

And like ruminating on the past, so that's that junky quality you're talking about, like

thinking about things that have literally no importance and can't move you forward?

Well, sometimes it's necessary to think about where you've been to better understand why

you want to go in a certain direction. So ruminating can be constructive.

One last thing. So I think you specifically talking about that quote, somebody emailed

you about trauma a long time ago, and you basically said if the toxicants and the energy

substances and things are right, you can kind of think how you want to about past events.

And so that just includes kind of intermittently thinking about things that have happened in

the past. That doesn't mean you reject what's happened to you. You're just not stuck on

them. Is that right?

Yeah. My view of memory is that it's a developmental state. Even though it passes in a flash, still

it changes our development all through the organism. Every little so-called memory, memorable

experience that we have is changing the structure of our organism. And it's simply scanning

the state of our organism when you're ruminating or considering the meaning of the past. It's

all present in the state of your organism. When you're remembering, you're really being

present to yourself.

Interesting. Okay. This one is, "May you ask Ray what he thinks about some people being

more subservient to authority than others? Why do some have this innate rebellious attitude

while others follow the narrative, no questions asked?"

It has a lot to do with your metabolic energy, how much DHEA and progesterone and pregnenolone

are circulating through your system. So you feel resilient enough to reject every little

thing that seems unhealthy.

Great stuff. I didn't know if this was true, but this next one says, "Thoughts on Chernobyl

steadily reactivating." Is that right?

Say it again.

It says, "Thoughts on Chernobyl steadily reactivating." Is that a thing?

I'm not sure what it means. The area around Chernobyl continues to be extremely contaminated

and deadly.

There were a few articles, I think it was last week, at least the ones that I saw, that

said that the detectors that are there in the sealed reactor that is under a concrete

sarcophagus, they're detecting levels of radiation that are increasing and can only be produced

if the chain reaction is somehow intensifying.

That's definitely possible. Molten fuel, for example, is moving around.

Yeah, they were thinking of essentially sending a robot in there and basically sealing the

actual reactor, the smaller portion of it, with graphite, is what they said, to sort

of stop the chain. They will try to stop the chain reaction, but they're also kind of hedging

their bets and saying, "It may actually trigger a nuclear blast, so we're not promising any

results."

We'll do a few more of these and then we'll let you go at, well, it's my time, your 6.30

time for sure, Ray, so we won't keep you too long.

Okay, "How to stop, slow down body hair and beard hair growth. Could topical progesterone

work or something else?"

There were studies published in France in the 1960s of topical progesterone showed women

with definite sideburns and whiskers and masculine chest hair who, through topical progesterone,

two or three months later, showed them with a feminine, hairless face and chest.

And same thing for a man, right? That would be the estrogen maybe activating the adrenals

and causing the skin to kind of be androgenized, is that right?

Yes, when you're deficient in those protective hormones, especially pregnenolone and progesterone,

then you're likely to overdrive the stress hormones and come out with too much androgens,

especially in women, and too much estrogen in men.

And just an update, on the Coke here, now all of the bottles say "Reducido Azúcar,"

and then I talked to the dude that works at the Tienda and he said all of the Coke now

is like that in Mexico. And so that is a thing now, like they've just changed the formula

of Coke and all of it tastes different now. And the dude confirmed that, just to give

an update for anybody who cares. So that is very sad day.

What kind of sugar is this?

I wish I had written it down, but it was like a mixture of new types of sugar. This is totally

new to you, right?

Yeah, I hadn't heard it at all.

I told the guy it was "Muy Malo," and he laughed. Okay, so let's get to these last, I skipped

over a few, but let's get to, okay, this was a popular one. Is there a way to remineralize

teeth and heal cavities?

Basically no. If the enamel is just slightly eroded and the protein framework is still

there, yeah, it can be very nicely remineralized. But once the decay has gone through the thin

layer of dentine and has broken down the dentine, gone through the thin layer of enamel and

entered the dentine, then the tooth from the inside can close off the progress. If you

have a very stable hormonal vitamin D calcium balance, the tooth from the inside is constantly

renewing the cytoplasm in the dentine channels and will close off, create resistance to the

advancing cavity. But I've never heard of being able to fill a cavity from the inside.

It can simply stop the progress.

Have you seen that study that got published in 2018? I think it was basically they showed

that applying aspirin topically to the tooth, despite being acidic, actually led to tooth

regeneration. I forget how much was regenerated, but it reversed that process and some actual

regeneration happened.

Was it in the dentine or just the enamel surface?

That I don't know. I mean, it may have been just a very, very shallow cavity and that's

why it regenerated. But I remember it was aspirin, it was topical solution. And they

were surprised too. They thought that because it's acidic, it should actually erode the

tooth even more. But in fact, it actually led to some regeneration.

I think the acid theory of tooth decay has tremendous weakness. The idea that bacteria

just make an acid. I think it's much more complicated than that involving antibodies

and subtler handling of the minerals.

You may have seen it. There was a study earlier than that back in 2015, which said that unbeknownst

to most people, competitive athletes have extremely poor dental health. And that study

tied that poor dental health to low thyroid function because of the constant exertion

they were having.

I didn't see that one, but thyroid is the main regulator of the health of your saliva

and the quality of your saliva really is in charge of what happens to your teeth on the

outside and it tends to correspond to the vitality of the pulp chamber, which maintains

the dentine from the inside. But definitely the thyroid is the main hormone governing

the quality of saliva.

Great stuff. So I was thinking for the last 25 minutes, we would just tune into the Great

Reset and is there anything new that, of course there is, but is there anything to focus on

that's happening that's mildly interesting or reveals something that they're doing?

The established lies are coming apart and resistance is starting to show some effects.

Do you mean the Wuhan lab stuff?

Yeah. Ron Unz, he has a good article showing the value of two articles, different theories,

whether it was a lab accident or not, but then he gives a third interpretation that

everyone seems to be carefully avoiding, which is the long established germ warfare policies

of the United States. Unz goes through the facts that align so much more perfectly with

this third option than with just the lab accident or not theories.

There's another article on the site, a recent one on his site, which says that basically

it was a failed bioweapon attack on China launched by the United States and when the

Chinese didn't take the bait, then basically the US said, well, we have an opportunity

to use it on somebody else. Who would that be? Well, our population and the rest of the

world and we're going to use this to tighten control for whatever other reason we have.

Iran really was the second target, just the elite politicians in Iran had a very terrible

attack right after China. I think one misapprehension of the germ warfare people, they really seem

to have believed that the ACE2 enzyme, they thought it was the receptor that let the virus

attack and enter cells. I think they really believed that. And the fact that the Chinese

have about 30% higher expression of the ACE2 enzyme, especially in women, women have a

higher expression than in men and in both sexes, the expression of ACE2 decreases with

aging. But I think the fact that the Chinese have such a thick expression of this ACE2

anti-angiotensin enzyme, I think that led people to believe that the Chinese would suffer

much more intensely from this virus than Americans or other racial groups. But in fact, the ACE2

is what defends us against inflammatory attacks such as virus. And so the populations that

express the most ACE2 rather than being the most susceptible to catching the virus, they're

the ones with the most powerful means for resisting the inflammatory consequences. So

women, young women are the most resistant, but it happens that the Chinese heredity gives

them an especially high resistance.

I'm not saying it wasn't produced in a lab, but isn't the idea that it's a bioweapon kind

of conflict with the idea that it's not harmful at all? I mean, the activation of the renin

angiotensin system, but that all of this stuff is just way overboard and just about control.

Yeah. Rona Unz talks about that, that it wasn't intended to kill many people and didn't really

kill lots of people, but it was a nuisance just like an effective cold virus. But the

theory was that it would give Chinese 30% more colds than it would give Americans.

Oh, interesting. And for this whole thing to work, would they really had to have created

something? I don't buy into it, but the alt narrative that there's nothing, you know what

I mean? And actually a lot of major, I think Patrick Timpani, he keeps listing people saying

that there is no virus, but isn't the whole thing now that, what's that word they say

for making viruses? It's in the news all the time now. You know what I'm talking about?

The Fauci keeps saying it, like they'll enhance a virus or whatever.

Oh, gain of function.

Yeah, gain of function. But anyways, you're saying they had to have created something,

right?

Yeah. Luc Montagnier has clearly expressed that he, in his lab work, understands how

you create a gain of function. You find some species difference, like the human expression

of the ACE2 enzyme was chosen as a target. And so they just adjusted the enzyme to be

able to stick more firmly, adjusted the virus so that it would stick more firmly to that

enzyme. And the people are arguing against the whole existence of viruses are in a way

onto something because the mechanism by which we maintain our genetic and physiological

interactions among the various parts of our body, the circulatory systems are carrying

exosomes in which our cells put out genetic messages that are sent to other cells. But

this apparatus is the same one that the viruses use to replicate the viral message. And in

size and structure, our exosomes are in most ways indistinguishable from the things that

are classified as viruses. And so if you give a vaccine or catch a virus and get the nucleic

acids into some of your cells, those cells experiencing distress will increase their

production of exosomes, which pick up relevant bits of nucleic acid and proteins and lipids

and package them in a little virus-like package, which those exosomes then travel to different

parts of the body and are excreted in sweat, in the breath, in the urine and so on. And

so we are creating things that function like viruses and look like viruses and are made

in the same system in the cell that replicate viruses. So I think the people that deny that

there is such a thing as a virus are really just helping to call attention to the probable

origin of all viruses was the mixture of external transmitted nucleic acids, basically transmitted,

excreted and transmitted in the form of exosomes as a natural physiological adaptive process.

Now, aren't the mRNA vaccines essentially an artificial replication of that whole exosome

paradigm, but in a really harmful manner?

Yeah, I don't know how aware the virus people were of exosomes, but that's something that

is completely left out of most of the discussion. In fact, the vaccine nucleic acid, the messenger

RNA can be packaged into exosomes and transmitted to other cells, including our germ cells and

into our sweat and transmitted to people we touch or breathe on.

Speaking of that-

A couple more things on Montagnier. He said as early as March, 2020, that the virus is

most certainly man-made after having studied it for a couple of months. And he basically

said this virus contains sequences that are not known to occur in any natural virus of

the same category of the coronavirus, including a protein sequence that is known to be part

of the HIV virus. And then of course, immediately French press started publishing articles saying

he must have run out of his anti-psychotic medication.

Yeah, what they're doing now, the last two or three days, I think they've created another

crazy story claiming that he says all the vaccinated people will be dead within two

years just to make him sound crazy. He didn't say that, but by inserting that claiming that

he said that they're denaturing, defanging his actual message that the virus was deliberate

and stupid and dangerous.

What about his other message from the same interview, which he said that having a vaccination

campaign during pandemic is absolutely the dumbest thing a public health agency can do

because it's actually causing the virus to mutate in order to avoid the vaccine and evolve.

And that's what's creating the new "variants". And in fact, it's making people more susceptible

to dying from these new variants due to the antibody dependent enhancement process.

Yeah, that's the sort of thing he says that they want to shut up by making him sound crazy.

Do you think there's any truth to that? Basically, that these people are now more susceptible

to dying from future encountering either another coronavirus or any virus really? Because you

said something similar about the flu vaccines, that some of the deaths from coronavirus were

following flu vaccination campaigns.

Yeah, but several studies have shown that people who were vaccinated for influenza the

following season were much, much more likely to catch a coronavirus. So you become partially

immune to influenza, but instead you substitute increased susceptibility to coronavirus infection.

So the whole thing, all of the facts invalidate the claims both about influenza vaccines and

the COVID.

So which one do you think is a bigger worry for a vaccinated person? The chronic inflammatory

state, which these vaccines will probably trigger and keep for a long time, potentially

for life and even transgenerational, or the potential for ADE when this person encounters

another virus later on in their life?

The risk of exaggerated antibody intensification of symptoms, the risk is so great that even

though we don't know how often it's going to happen, it's just a very crazy risk to

take for the world population.

So these people could die 10 years from now when they encounter a completely different

virus and of course you'll never be tied back to the vaccine they got 10 years ago.

Yeah.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the Israel-Palestine stuff, but one question I have for you about

that is why, and maybe this is wrong, but why doesn't Israel give the Palestinians vaccines?

Or is it some kind of reverse psychology thing that they're withholding vaccines from?

Part of the truth is probably that like American, black people often look at the history of

what the CDC has done experimenting on black people, experimenting in other countries,

doing experiments in the guise of vaccine where really they're doing something else.

I think a lot of Palestinians are likewise fearful of being experimented on by the vaccinators.

So that would just be a no-sell immediately, like if Israel was like, "We have vaccines

for Palestinians," they would never accept those?

If I was a Palestinian, I don't think I would.

No, I mean, there's actually documented cases around the world.

I think in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they kicked out representatives of a World Health

Organization because now they're firmly convinced that the vaccines that they're getting, donations

from Western countries are intended to sterilize the population.

And we have now some evidence that the same thing is happening in Africa.

So I don't think it's just the Palestinians that are mistrustful.

It's kind of like a third world being always suspicious of the rich people and their attempts

to provide benefit to the poor plebs.

They will never take that openly.

Right.

I kind of understand why the elites here would want to depopulate the US, but why would they

want to do that in Israel?

Oh, well, they're set on getting rid of the Palestinians.

But why would Israel vaccinate its own citizens if the higher-ups, assuming that they understand

that this vaccine is to harm people?

I'm not sure what they understand.

So Netanyahu doesn't think it's possible that he doesn't know it's for depopulation?

I think that's possible.

In other words, the elite may be sometimes stupid and not know that what they have unleashed

on themselves.

Is that what I'm hearing?

Yeah, the elite isn't unified.

On a world scale, they're unified in the sense of being a ruling class with its own interest.

But within that power system, there are constant subdivisions of power conflicts.

And so you have to look at each country's power elite and how it relates to the others.

So like Maxwell doesn't care about some Israeli citizen that, I don't know, shine shoes or

something, just as much as a Rockefeller doesn't care about an American.

Kind of the same type of thing?

Yeah.

The European Jews have a very race-like discrimination against the Jews of other origins, especially

African-originating Jews.

Interesting.

Okay, so we have about eight minutes left.

Is there anything that we should navigate to quickly before calling it a day?

You know what, though?

Let me answer that question that I just said.

What do you think about the ousting or throwing under the bus Bill Gates?

I haven't heard much about what's going on.

Well, he was framed as a womanizer and then Melinda and him got a divorce and now his

name is like the media is all over him as a bad person.

It has been coming out gradually ever since Epstein killed himself, supposedly.

The story was involving Bill Clinton and lots of the elite out political crowd and he was

in it right from an early stage.

It just takes time to develop.

I know that, but do you think he was impeding kind of their goals?

Like he has such a bad reputation now that they're like, "We need to do something

to get this guy off the air," or something like that?

I know I'm asking you to speculate, but it just seems so odd that they turn on...

Like that Epstein stuff has been around for a very long time and then the media just automatically

picks up on it now.

Like, it doesn't make any sense.

I think the media are in turmoil.

They are confused by things leaking out that shouldn't have, and I think they are in the

process of reorganizing and trying to find a new equilibrium that can be sustained, but

everything does seem to be falling apart.

Yeah, I saw an article.

It was in Russia Today, which not many people read, but basically they're saying that Western

media is largely collapsing due to...

Also I mean, no pun intended, collapsing viewings and readings from the general population.

Nobody seems to be going to mainstream media anymore.

I mean, an increasingly smaller percentage of people are reading it, which means less

ad revenue, and unless the government starts to pay the media directly to subsidize them,

they don't really have a survival plan.

Yeah, I think those forces are really stirring up confusion in the mass media on different

sides.

Okay, absolute last thing, and then I'll read the super chats.

Ray, I feel like the olive oil on the carrot or mushrooms is like a revelation.

I think it works so much better than coconut oil, and so I just want to...

I think my digestion is the best it's ever been, and the only thing that I can think

of that I changed was the olive oil.

Does that make sense?

Yeah, I noticed the same thing.

There are allergenic properties in coconut that even extreme refining can miss, but olive

oil in the unrefined state, it's a fruit oil, not a seed oil.

And as such, it brings with the oil a lot of anti-inflammatory, very protective intestinal

redesigning and protecting drug effects.

One last food question for me, because since you brought up the food thing.

Ray, I noticed you've commented in the past on orange peel as being very high in things

like naringenin, hisperidin, et cetera, et cetera.

What are your thoughts on orange peel wax, which is available as basically food grade

material and it's got this really dark red, almost brownish color, which makes me think

it's very, very high.

It's a concentrated form, basically, dietary form of all of these flavonoids.

What was it called?

Orange peel wax.

It consists of about 50 to 60% of polycorsonil basically, but its color is very dark red,

almost like a brick, which makes me think it's high in these flavonoids that we know

have protective effects.

It sounds good.

I'll find out more about it.

But meanwhile, marmalade tastes very good and has those same things.

So does the pulp need to be removed?

It's only basically a thin scraping of the peel?

Is that what's the beneficial part?

Pretty much the whole thing, the white stuff as well as the orange stuff, has those flavonoids.

Okay.

So here are the donations.

My computer doesn't start.

Okay.

Peggy for $10.

Jean Pack for $20.

Thank you so much, Jean.

Plu Plus for 50 SAR.

I don't know what that is.

David Hendricks for $20.

Thank you so much.

Janet Pack for $20.

Thank you so much, Janet.

Piordor, I won't even try your last name, 199.

Thank you so much, Piordor.

Linda Belfry for $5.

Thank you so much.

And Pure Therapy for 499.

Thank you so much, Pure Therapy.

And then there's one last one, I think from Michelle for $50.

Wow.

Okay.

I will send all of those to Ray.

Let me do one more advertisement for Ray here.

The newsletter is available by email now.

It's $28.

You can send it to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And then you can purchase progesterone, Progeste from Keenogen by emailing Catherine at keenogen@gmail.com.

And each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

Okay.

That is the last thing.

Ray, any parting words?

And Georgie, any parting words?

Not really.

I mean, I'm glad that the narrative is falling apart and hopefully the elite will consume

itself and not force us to take matters into our own hands.

Well, okay.

Ray, stay on the line.

We'll just keep you for one minute extra.

Guys, thank you so much.

Give this episode a like, share it online, et cetera.

We have an amazing listenership.

Sincerely appreciate it.

These are always extremely fun to do.

Sincere thanks to Ray, sincere thanks to Georgie for making these possible and our amazing

audience for also making it possible.

Thanks everybody.

Take care.Okay, and we're live, Georgie DeKalb, Ray Peat.

Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.

Thank you, Georgie.

Thank you, Ray.

And we're just going to rifle through a bunch of questions, but before we do that, how are

you, Ray?

Very good.

Yeah?

So the weather had gotten a little bit sunnier in Eugene, so that's always a positive.

It's going to be in the hundreds, over a hundred this weekend.

And then how do you, do you go sit in the sun or what do you do?

No, I'm going to stay inside all day, tomorrow at least.

We open the door at about 1 a.m. when it cools off, blow in some cooler air and then close

it up for the day.

The house is concrete, so it holds its temperature for about a day.

And blocking that 5G as well.

Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

Okay, and then Georgie, how are you, sir?

I really like your elevator music that you put at the start of the show.

It was very soothing.

Did you hear it through my headphones?

No, I heard the music.

Was I not supposed to hear it?

Oh, no, you weren't.

Okay, that's a little bit weird.

Ray, did you hear the music too?

Yeah.

Oh, okay, weird.

Okay, that's a new...

I thought it was kind of interesting.

You tried to hold a conversation over this really loud music and I thought, "Wow, that

must be a new feature."

That's one of the...

In conference call music.

That's one of the reasons we're upgrading equipment, because when I'm talking to you

guys before the show, I'm always hearing music and it's obnoxious.

Okay, enough of that.

This show, like I said, told you guys before, I don't feel like it's for me or necessarily

per se Georgie, although Ray and Georgie, you guys' interfacing and bouncing ideas off

each other is, I think, what the people are here to listen to.

Okay, so I'm just going to go through these questions and read them.

And Ray, some of this stuff is going to be redundant and answer as much or as little

as you want for all of this.

So our first one is from Drew F. and he says, "Trestosterone/MENT is not 5-alpha reduced,

but bodybuilders and some post-finasteride sufferers experience benefits in terms of

mood, anabolism, et cetera.

Is androgen receptor agonism a likely explanation for the effects?

It is a much stronger androgen than testosterone."

Which reduced testosterone is it?

Georgie, do you know what this is?

It's...

Yes, I know.

It's a new steroid.

It's 7-alpha-methylated version of nendrolone, which is a carbon-18 steroid of the estrein

family.

So it was...

I was always suspicious when they add the methyl group.

Yeah, it's actually very hepatotoxic.

As you know, Ray, methyl groups at position 17, 7, and potentially others, they've all

been proven to have severe hepatotoxicity.

But bodybuilders like it because I guess they don't value their liver that much, but also

it's the steroid that can achieve the same with lower doses and they think it's worth

it instead of abusing the testosterone in higher dosages.

That steroid was developed as a male contraceptive candidate, and I think it's still in clinical

trials for that.

But even the company that developed it and is running the clinical trials got discouraged

given the hepatotoxicity.

Ray, do you want to clarify the methyl group?

So adding a methyl group to a steroid is risky, you said?

Yeah, it just sends it off on unknown pathways.

The liver never had to deal with such things, and so I think it's extremely unpredictable

and dangerous.

Good stuff.

And then we've talked about post-finasteride a bunch, so I want to kind of get into that

again.

I kind of want to...

I think his main question was, "Is activation of the androgen receptor a plausible explanation

of the antidepressant and general feelings of well-being from using these androgenic

steroids?"

I think it's plausible.

Great stuff.

Thank you for that, guys.

Okay, Marcelo, this is just kind of a statement.

Thank you, Danny, for your contributions to the community.

You are a big reason why Ray's work...

Wealth of knowledge is available to us.

Thank you so much, Georgie, for his continuing curiosity and dedicating his life's work towards

advancements in this space.

Hope this helps.

Thank you, Marcelo.

Sincerely appreciate that.

Thank you to Ray for being humble and inspiration for all things.

Andrew Wallace says, "What would you do if you had Crohn's?

What would be your protocol?"

Me?

Yeah, Ray, I always assume...

I guess I'm just asking you, and then Georgi can chime in at any point.

Pretty much what I do anyway.

Assume that the intestine is my contact with the world, and I have to protect it, and so

I don't want to offend it in any way, and Crohn's disease is a seriously offended intestine.

And from what I've read, it seems like you've dealt with a lot of serious intestinal things

over the years, as one would in this environment.

And so it's not like you're speaking from reading...

I know you read, obviously, a lot, but you're speaking from personal experience.

Is that right?

Yeah.

Starting as a baby with migraines, which recurred every time I would do certain things

wrong up until my mid-40s.

I would still...

The last one, for example, was when I was visiting in San Francisco and didn't realize

that they had fluoridated water, and I would occasionally drink some of that water, and

I was taking Cynoplus or Cynomel orally, and within two or three days, I had a tremendous

migraine, and that started me thinking about it, and fluoride can totally wipe out the

activity of T3 if it happens to be present in your stomach and the T3 is exposed to it.

Amazing stuff.

Okay, so obviously...

I have a question in regards to Crohn's disease.

Ray, have you seen some of the more recent studies claiming that Crohn's disease may

be caused by a type of mycobacteria, which is known to cause Crohn's disease in animals,

and now they're saying the same thing may be true in humans?

Yeah, but the inflammation and poor digestion are set up to conditions for such things to

accumulate and multiply.

So basically making sure that you don't irritate your intestine more than absolutely necessary

is at the basis of a protocol for keeping...

You can find a mycoplasm in just about any sick person.

It's sort of opportunistic and looks for a sort of place to live.

So maybe this antibiotic therapy that they're now trying in Europe for this potentially...

They're treating it as a bacteria infection, but it's really destroying the microbiome

and keeping the intestine sterile, which reduces the inflammation.

Not necessarily...

It's not only one bacteria, it's just...

This is helping because it's reducing the amount of bacteria in the intestine anyways.

Yeah, just taking a series of penicillin doses or eating raw carrots, for example, can have

very similar effects.

And in both rats and people, it turns out that anything that cleans up your intestine

will lower your cortisol and estrogen and increase your progesterone just because the

intestine is such a chronic drain and source of stress.

In regards to the carrot salad and in general fiber, what are your thoughts on supplementing

with pure cellulose if one could find a pure source?

It would be interesting.

They used to sell basically a cellulose tablet for weight loss.

I've never tried one, but it seemed like a good idea because cellulose doesn't have the

estrogen-promoting symptoms that a lot of other fibers do.

Yeah, the reason I'm mentioning is I was reading some studies.

They're using various cellulose esters as binders for drugs for developing pharmaceutical

drugs and some of these esters, like for example, ethyl cellulose, showed remarkable antibacterial

effects in animals and reduced inflammation.

So I thought maybe it's because it's clearing out their intestines somehow.

Oh, yeah.

It was a very popular laxative effect as well as weight loss.

Was this in the past, like in the maybe '60s or '70s?

I used to see the ads for it on TV as recently as 1986, I think it was.

Interesting, very interesting.

Speaking of cortisol, okay, this one's from New Health and they say good cortisol blocker

supplements for weight loss.

What is your thoughts on that, Ray?

What blocker?

Like a cortisol blocker.

Progesterone and pregnenolone are the best ones I know of, but working at the pituitary

level, a lot of things, sugar, aspirin, probably sodium, anything that stabilizes your blood

sugar and metabolism, reduces inflammation, will defend you against cortisol.

Thanks for that.

New Health says, "There's now a spinoff of the Ray Peat community with Morley Robbins

ideas, aka Ceruloplasmin.

Would you be willing to do a show on this from a Ray Peat perspective?"

I think these were when they originally thought that Georgie and I were just going to do a

Q&A.

Ray, what are your thoughts on Ceruloplasmin?

It's an acute phase reactant, so do you want to be increasing Ceruloplasmin?

Is that a goal of a diet or lifestyle or supplement routine?

Not my goal.

Do you want to comment on Morley Robbins?

You know who that is?

Are you familiar with their work?

No, no.

I have a question.

If somebody has low Ceruloplasmin, some of the studies claim that this is a sign of low

thyroid function.

In a situation like that, considering that Ceruloplasmin apparently takes care of the

copper and makes sure it doesn't become toxic to the various organs, would somebody be potentially

at risk if they have low Ceruloplasmin and low thyroid?

Would they be at risk when eating high copper foods like liver and shellfish?

I think so.

Did you ever read Carl Pfeiffer's books?

I think he caused himself to lose pigment by being so obsessive about keeping copper

down.

He was very concentrated on the risk of too much copper, probably having seen some people

with Ceruloplasmin deficiency.

Ann Louise Gittleman, Andy Cutler, and Carl Pfeiffer were all about copper toxicity.

It seems like from reading your work that they were misled in what they thought was

going on.

Yeah.

He took a little capsule of flowers of sulfur every day for many, many years.

He had no trace of skin or hair pigment left.

Okay, great stuff.

This one's from Joseph.

He says, "Can you speak about nitric oxide and the word on the street that it's good

for Cialis or Viagra, so that it works like those substances?"

I'm afraid there is quite a bit of overlap.

The initial, as soon as nitric oxide was discovered to be produced in the body, they were seeing

its involvement in everything degenerative and harmful.

Then when the Viagra came on the market, suddenly for about five or six years, everything published

was how great nitric oxide is, it prevents hypertension and protects you against everything.

Thousands of articles came out suddenly reversing it from a dangerous free radical to a cure-all.

Then about 10 or 15 years ago, there was a gradual return to sanity and realizing that

it's one of the very central things to degeneration, aging, the follow-up of trauma, estrogen interactions,

everything stress-related and degeneration-related involves the pro-inflammatory effects of ethanol.

Two follow-up questions.

One says, "Is aspirin safe to take every day and also is lactose-free milk?"

It doesn't taste very good, but I think it's safe enough.

It probably doesn't let you absorb nutrients quite as well as natural lactose-containing

milk, but I don't think it's harmful.

Then your thoughts on using aspirin every day?

Yeah, when I had a good supply, I was taking it every day very consistently, but sometimes

I forget to take it when it isn't in a convenient form, like some of it is powdered so fine

it's choking when you try to take it just on your tongue.

Georgie, interrupt me at any time.

Okay, this one's a little bit long, so bear with me for a second.

"I've been trying to have a baby for more than a year, but I have azuspermia.

Found after three semen analyses and undetectable levels of spurn after a testicular ultrasound,

they found a small varicocele in both testicles.

I've been taking seven to eight milligrams of extremistain for three weeks.

For how much longer is it safe to take?"

So this is the first question.

"Will continued extremistain use help me fix the varicocele as well as the azus-"

What's she taking?

Exemistain.

It's a steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

I'll just finish up this question.

It's like there's two more sentences here and we can go through it.

"If exemistain doesn't fix the azuspermia, what else can I do?

I'd like to avoid having a varicocele ectomy or even worse, surgical sperm extraction from

IVF.

After three weeks of exemistain, my total testosterone went from 400 to 756.

Exemistain has also increased my FSH and LH and are now above standard range.

I thought FSH and LH would go down as testosterone goes up."

So were there bits of that question that you have comments on, Rick?

Yeah, I think you can get a safer inhibition of aromatase using aspirin, progesterone,

completely safe things.

Thyroid is very important, but just with aspirin, progesterone, and thyroid, you can get your

ratio back, testosterone, pregnenolone up and estrogen down.

Supplementing pregnenolone and thyroxine historically was very effective for correcting infertility

and enlivening inactive sperms.

And so the azuspermia, if the cholesterol is high and the person wasn't taking enough

thyroid, that would be a result of that with high estrogen?

Yeah, the thyroid and pregnenolone make their energy-producing system revive.

Great stuff, thanks for that.

Okay, Peggy says, "Question for the Q&A.

Thoughts on ivermectin for COVID, prophylaxis, and any alternative as it is almost impossible

to get a prescription for it.

Thank you."

Prophylaxis suggests you would be taking some every day for an indefinite time until you

didn't get the infection, and the normal use of it is a very short course.

About one person in a thousand in the studies of using it to treat parasites will show signs

of brain damage.

I don't think it's a good idea to take maybe thousands of daily doses, even a moderate

amount of something that once in a while is known to cause brain damage.

There was some podcast that was talking about ivermectin and a bunch of people emailed me

about it the exact same time.

Again, Georgie, interrupt at any time.

Okay, so this person says-

I can give a few more, I mean, based on the studies that recently came out.

Methylene blue, a well-known antiviral, at least four studies came out in the last month

saying it can both prevent and treat COVID-19.

Of course, there's no medical advice, but that's what the study said.

Another hydroxychloroquine, you can try plain old quinine.

My personal favorite, hydroxychloroquine is just a patented, more liver-toxic version

of quinine.

Naringenin, also a few good studies.

So drinking orange juice should have similar effect than taking the isolated version.

And aspirin, vitamin C and vitamin D, I mean, all of these now have quite a few studies

behind them.

Unfortunately, everything is being censored by mainstream media, so you have to go to

PubMed to find them.

But I wouldn't say-

Ivermectin would be one of the last things I would try considering all the other safer

alternatives that are out there.

Cyproheptadine, famotidine, which is an acid blocker, but apparently is also a potent anti-serotonin

agent as well.

Really, I don't know where the Ivermectin craze is coming from.

Maybe that's the only thing that hit the mainstream news, but tons of other chemicals, safer and

cheaper and available over the counter that can do just as well, if not better, than Ivermectin

with fewer side effects.

Vitamin D is very effective.

There was a study done in Spain in a hospital which was withdrawn after a lot of doctors

wrote ignorant letters to the publisher.

For some reason, the editor caved in and had it withdrawn.

But it was very clear that they gave, I think it was 6,000 units, something like that, per

day.

Maybe it was 8,000 first dose and then 6,000 units a day to people who were admitted to

hospital intensive care, very sick with COVID.

Simply that treatment with vitamin D reduced mortality by about, I think it was 60%, just

an absolutely clear difference, but the readers who didn't like vitamin D quibbled that they

hadn't done statistics quite right.

But you can't miss a 60% disappearance of dead patients.

I would like to see a doctor argue that 60% more live people is statistically insignificant.

Very stupid people who are complaining.

A shout out to the Kate Deering and Kitty Blomfield podcast you did with them.

I thought it was like a tour de force and you at least, I thought you cleared up every

single anti-vitamin D argument that exists on the internet right now.

I was very thankful for that podcast and I think you can type in Kitty Blomfield, a win

at life podcast, vitamin D, Ray Peat, and a person can find it instantaneously.

Okay.

Hi, Danny.

Hi, Georgie.

Hi, Ray Peat.

Many thanks for the show.

Please keep going.

I have one question.

My 10 year old daughter has hypothyroid symptoms, low energy, weight gain, digestive problems.

Her TSH is between four and five and her free T4 is around 12.

Doctors here don't test for other markers, unfortunately.

Doctor says everything is okay and no need to worry.

Do you have any suggestions what we can do?

Preferably nutritional plus lifestyle.

Thanks again, Timo.

P.S.

I'm lucky you could take my question.

What do you think about that?

Very important to get the TSH down.

TSH at that level itself is causing symptoms, pro-inflammatory symptoms and it's going to

disturb her puberty development, all kinds of development and the history of that bizarre

attitude towards TSH, I think it's on my website, 50 Years of Fraud is part of the title.

There's just no scientific basis for relying on TSH, especially at such very high levels

as five.

And you know, just my limited understanding of things of reading through hypothyroidism,

the unsuspected illness, like he wrote, it talks about childhood hypothyroidism and it's

not crazy to investigate a thyroid supplement for a child, right?

Oh, not at all.

Sometimes it has started at a very young age.

It's increasingly important around seven or eight or nine when the first signs of puberty

are coming on because the estrogen is going to slow down the thyroid function.

Great stuff.

Okay.

This one's from JV Marketing and they say, "Hi guys.

I recently started taking thyroid 12.5 micrograms of T3 and 37.5 micrograms of T4.

I am day three into this and my waking temperature has been slightly lower than usual.

Is it normal for a slight dip in temperature before improvements are made?

Could this be a nutritional deficiency?"

You know, very low thyroid people will have, especially during the night, high cortisol

and adrenaline usually.

And you should check your pulse at the same time when you wake up along with the temperature.

And then after having a breakfast with, for example, a lot of orange juice, the stress

hormones are going to be decreased when you get your glucose level up.

The adrenaline goes down, the cortisol will go down.

Both of those have kept your temperature, both of them, and pulse rate kept up by high

adrenaline during the night.

And so by which of those changes the most, you can tell what night stress was responsible

for them and when you get your thyroid gradually improving your carbon dioxide production and

stabilizing your glycogen stores, your nocturnal stress goes down and so you're revealing the

hypothyroid condition that was hidden under the stress hormones.

During daytime testing, people who were very hypothyroid such as a 5 or 6 on the TSH level

have been very hyper and normal seeming, not fat or edematous or sluggish or anything,

but they were found to have 30 to 40 times the daily output of adrenaline making up for

the low thyroid production.

And so it's pretty common to have extreme slowdown when you start on your thyroid.

That's why it's so important to keep a chart marked off for at least 2 or 3 weeks showing

your temperature and pulse rate both on the same chart so that you can draw a line and

where it should with an ideal starting dose of thyroid, you should see the lines rising

steadily towards the goal of pulse rate and temperature at the end of 2 or 3 weeks.

But if at first you see the numbers going down, that's evidence that you're getting

out of the stress.

Great stuff.

Thank you for that, Ray.

Okay, this one's from Jean, mega super supporter of the show and she says, "I wanted to..."

A lot of these people are mega super supporters, "but I wanted to ask and hear more about why

people who are vaccinated are getting colds and flus right now.

There seems to be a lot of discussion in my neighborhood that people are out sick at work

and feeling flu/cold symptoms, even though it's extremely warm here."

The purpose of any vaccine is to create a systemic inflammation and in general that

weakens your overall immune system, even though it pumps up your specific antibodies, the

general inflammation is a weakness at least during the time you're having symptoms and

unfortunately sometimes for a much longer time such as the year after people have an

influenza vaccination, their rate of coronavirus infection was greatly increased, 50% of the

people were infected, 60% more likely to get infected by a different virus because they

were protected against influenza virus.

So the idea, the officials actually say stupid things like, "Get vaccinated, it'll make

you healthy."

Thanks for that.

And we'll take a break here, Ray, like, I don't know, like maybe 20 minutes or so because

I know this, I don't want to give you like a lobotomy from just asking you a hundred

questions, but I know...

I have a question about the vaccines.

Is there any truth to saying that basically the vaccines are sacrificing general immunity

in order to boost specific resistance to a very specific virus while at the same time

making you vulnerable just as you mentioned, you also mentioned influenza and corona, but

I think this applies to any virus, right?

If you shift the immune response, protecting from only one virus, you're exposing yourself,

becoming more compromisable to all the other viruses.

Yeah, there were, I think, 10 studies showing that with influenza.

Follow up, the whole doctrine, going back to Ehrlich's time, it's a drug industry-centered

theory of what immunity amounts to.

Paul Ehrlich was selling his patent drugs and he shared the Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff,

who was an embryologist who saw immunity as the whole organism maintaining itself, a total

inclusive concept of what immunity or resistance is.

Ehrlich proposed a theory that was ideal for selling magic bullet drugs.

The concept of magic bullet was converted to the antibody theory of immunity that your

B cells produce the specific immunity.

So logically, if you don't have a specific drug for every conceivable disease, then you're

going to need a vaccine for every existing or possible disease because the antibody theory

of immunity is really just a silver bullet, one drug to sell for one disease.

Great stuff.

Okay, this one's from James B. and he says, "Question," okay, this kind of trends on the

first question we talked about.

He says, "Question, if your lab rat was supplementing with pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHE,

and you had the task of building the most amount of muscle while somewhat preserving

your health, could you outline a potential stack you would use?

I was thinking about 50 milligrams of testosterone base along with 25 milligrams of masteron.

I know these aren't hepatoxic, but would you dissolve these in tocopherol and take sublingually

before swallowing for maximal effect?

P.S.

Your thoughts on low-dose trenbolone base?"

Even with natural testosterone, I think people are generally getting overdosed.

Very healthy, very young man might produce four or five milligrams of testosterone per

day and so one or two milligrams well-assimilated should give you a tremendous boost of virility

and muscle strength.

And with DHEA, the teenage production is 12 to 15 milligrams and so it goes steadily down

with aging similar to testosterone.

But by the time a person is 30 or 40, five milligrams will still bring them up to a normal

level of DHEA.

And the others, the overdose is apparently the desired state.

I have a question about the amounts of steroids.

Yes, a younger, young, virile man will produce four to five milligrams of testosterone, but

they also clear estrogen much more effectively than an older person.

So their testosterone to estrogen ratio or testosterone to cortisol ratio is pretty high.

An older person basically tends to be overloaded with both estrogen and cortisol while having

their testosterone levels.

So the four to five milligrams, yes, they will potentially bring up the testosterone

levels up to the levels of a young, virile man, but they won't necessarily fix the issue

with the high estrogen and high cortisol.

So that person may not be necessarily feeling the same anabolic or mood boosting or whatnot

effects that a younger person would get from such a dosage simply because their stress

hormones are too high.

And I think that may be why older people and bodybuilders in general, they're overdosing

these steroids simply because they're not addressing the thyroid angle and they're trying

to shut down their stress hormones by simply over flooding them and overcrowding them with

these androgens.

That's why that may be one reason why they're using such high doses.

For several reasons, thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone.

It directly activates protein synthesis, lowers cortisol and the breakdown of protein and

inhibits the effect of cortisol and inflammatory things on aromatase.

It's an aromatase and cortisol antagonist.

So basically an anabolic approach with steroids should always take into account thyroid, right?

Or at least some other option of blocking cortisol in a safe manner.

Yeah, as a basic anabolic substance.

The muscles, if they're under stress or in forced idleness, will cause the muscle to

actually produce and secrete cortisol and estrogen.

And when they're properly activated with thyroid and activity, they will be a source of testosterone

and a sink for cortisol.

Okay, great stuff.

Thanks for that guys.

Okay, so this one's from Craig.

He says, "Craig Doe, I've been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea induced by arterial

fibrillation.

I'm on meds that make me feel terrible.

Tried cardioversion, didn't work.

I'm 53 fit.

Use a CPAP.

Any ideas how to get off meds?

Thank you."

People who are using CPAP are almost always hypothyroid and low in progesterone.

For many years, they've been curing sleep apnea with prothyroid things and progesterone.

Progesterone lowers the stress hormones, improves the depth of sleep and maintains regular breathing

and prevents hyperventilation.

The real problem in sleep apnea is cyclic hyperventilation followed by cessation.

When you go deficient in carbon dioxide, your breathing stops and you could even die from

respiratory arrest if you are producing so little carbon dioxide.

So thyroid and progesterone directly corrects the problem.

Acetazolamide has been used, I think, for 50 or 60 years to treat sleep apnea and it

indirectly raises your carbon dioxide level and keeps stimulating your breathing through

the night.

Amazing.

Thank you for that, Ray.

This next one's from-

I have something to add.

Most drugs on the market currently for AFib, which is the common name for atrial fibrillation,

are blood thinners.

And the flagship drug known as Xarelto was approved by the FDA with the FDA's knowledge

that the clinical trials conducted in Mexico and other Latin American countries were 100%

fraudulent.

There's a famous article by the Slate magazine, which came out in, I think it was 2016 or

'17, where they did an exposé of how FDA knew that the trials were fraudulent, not

simply deficient, but fraudulent.

Data was made up to support the approval of the drug.

And when Slate and other journalists tried to contact FDA, basically FDA refused to comment

on it and threatened the journalists that they will sue them and impose a gag order

if they continue walking around and talking how Xarelto is a dangerous, potentially murderous

drug.

So I would try to get off that drug because there are many other safer blood thinners.

A subsequent trial was done outside of the United States, I forgot where, but it compared

aspirin to Xarelto and found aspirin to be more effective and safer.

So I think Xarelto may be causing a lot of these problems, especially with the lowering

of carbon dioxide.

It's really not a safe drug.

Wait, you're saying the pharmaceutical companies are corrupt, Georgie?

I'm saying the FDA is corrupt.

Okay.

I had never heard that before.

Okay.

That is wild.

Okay.

Thank you for that, Georgie.

Thank you, Ray.

Where was I?

Okay.

Okay.

This was from Mohammed and he says, "Question for Dr. Ray Peat.

My mom is borderline diabetic, removed thyroid, and has pain in her feet that bothers her

a lot.

What can she do to treat this?"

What was her thyroid condition?

I think she had it removed, he said.

Oh, well, the doctors likely prescribe thyroxine, and in women, thyroxine fails to be activated

properly because of estrogen interfering with liver function, which should account for about

two thirds of your active thyroid function.

So for most women, thyroxine being what doctors like to prescribe just isn't correcting the

problem.

And so getting on a real thyroid supplement is essential when you've had the gland removed.

And maybe you feel confident in Armour in the US right now?

I haven't tried any Armour in recent years, but I haven't heard any new bad things about

it.

For several years, they were going back and forth, failing FDA tests and so on.

But for several years now, I haven't heard bad things about it.

So it's the only glandular right now that I would trust.

But during the time that Armour was being reformulated in the early '90s, I shifted to the synthetics.

First, Thyrolar formulated by Armour to exactly imitate natural Armour thyroid, and then Cynoplus,

which exactly imitated the Thyrolar formula, and made by the same company that makes Cynomel

or Pure T3.

And so those have been very reliable now for at least 30 years.

Thank you for that.

Amazing stuff.

Okay, we're coming up on 45 minutes or so.

Thank you, Ray.

Thank you, Georgie.

I sincerely appreciate you guys making this show possible.

Harrison, huge, gigantic donation.

Thank you so much, Harrison.

Thank you.

Thank you for making all this possible.

Matthew T., also another extremely generous donation.

Thank you, guys.

And then we'll move on to these super chats.

Maybe we'll take a quick break here, Ray.

And maybe we can talk about Progest-E, just a millisecond.

So 3,400 milligrams of progesterone per bottle dissolved in vitamin E. You can email Keenogen@gmail.com,

aka Catherine.

And you can...

She'll ship it extremely fast.

She just shipped me 12 bottles of it.

It's sitting in my refrigerator right now.

And Ray, do you want to dip into your gigantic bag of positive progesterone stories and say

anything about it?

Oh, no.

Nothing occurs to me right now.

Okay.

One thing you said on the vitamin D with Kate Dearing and Kitty was you didn't really think

of it like a hormone.

It's just this generalized stabilizing factor in cells.

And so I think you've said that before, but that resonated when you talked about it.

That was like a...

The brain is a major source and goal of progesterone.

And men have just as much in their brain, or should, as women.

And it's involved in the cell division process all the way up to nerve and muscle function.

Every conceivable thing in higher animals depends on progesterone.

Great stuff.

Thank you for that.

And if you're at gmail.com, you can message Catherine and she's very nice and she'll send

out the progesterone very quickly.

So thanks to Catherine.

Thanks to Keenogen.

Okay.

Nick P174 just donates $10.

Thank you for that, Nick.

Rising Stronger for 999 says, "For Dr. Peat, I've heard you mention milk and fruit as the

cosmic diet and wonder if there is an ethical component to how you view and structure your

nutrition.

Thanks to the three of you."

Yeah.

It has to do with cosmic entropy, actually.

It's why the whole energy concept of existence involves the cephalization process in all

animate beings.

And you can trace those processes of increasing consciousness and brain development through

the physics of the universe.

It all has to do with creating order, maintaining order.

And it happens that milk and fruits are the simplest and most order-preserving way to

integrate your life with the cosmos.

I love it.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Okay.

This one's from Umar.

And they say, "Does a benign tumor have a similar metabolism to a cancerous one?

I have had a benign osteochondrodroma on my upper femur since childhood.

What ways/supplementing can help in removing it?"

Thank you all.

If it's quiescent, not inflamed or growing, no, it doesn't have the cancer metabolism.

It's just a structural defect.

But any inflammation, according to the degree of the inflammation, is going to start having

the cancer metabolism.

Great stuff.

Thanks.

I wanted to mention rubbing progesterone on it, since it's simply a fibrotic structure,

may help a lot.

There's some older studies that seem to have stopped around the '70s that kept calling

progesterone the most potent anti-fibrotic chemical known to man.

And they suddenly stopped.

I guess the pharmaceutical industry got involved.

But they had success in animal studies by applying progesterone topically or subcutaneously

and managing to dissolve multiple metastases of much worse and malignant tumors.

So I don't see a reason why it couldn't be applied in this case as well.

The anti-fibrotic effect, I've seen examples of hundreds of times.

I think the reason they stopped talking about that effect is that the mechanism involves

interfering with estrogen's pro-fibrotic effect, activating nitric oxide and serotonin.

That group of inflammatory things, estrogen, nitric oxide, and serotonin, are all blocked

by progesterone.

And those are the pro-degenerative, pro-fibrotic substances.

Great stuff.

Thanks for that, guys.

This one's from James.

"Guys, I've had man boobs for years, which recently developed into gynecomastia, but

only on my left breast.

Is there a way to reverse this?"

Thank you.

Just today I got an email saying that his chest fat and gynecomastia regressed thoroughly

from taking quite a bit of progesterone.

But I think it's essential to use vitamin D and thyroid and all of the anti-aromatase

substances, including some aspirin, to keep it under control.

Amazing.

Great stuff.

This one's from another James.

They say, "When approximately did the United States transform from a constitutional republic

into an empire, or was the USA always set up to be one from the beginning?"

Well, the spreading from the colonies across the continent, taking the Western United States

away from Mexico and then following that up with war against Spain to take the Philippines

and Cuba, the imperial mentality goes back right almost to the beginning.

But the 20th century has been steady imperialism with the banana republics being kept in line

with sending battleships every year so they would threaten another country in the hemisphere.

And there was a temporary let up with FDR's good neighbor policy, or as good as we are.

Ray, are you still there?

I just actually—

Yeah, he's there.

Okay, I just lost everything.

Okay, we're back.

Sorry about that.

Go ahead, Ray.

Sorry.

Well, it has just grown in its intensity.

Starting right at FDR's death, policies were absolutely 180 degrees reversed where he had

planned a post-war anti-imperialist policy.

He had a conference with Wendell Wilkie.

They agreed that whichever party won after his term was up would follow the decolonization

anti-imperialist world policy.

But it happens that Wilkie got a cold and died at a very young age.

And then just before Roosevelt could find out that Alan Dulles was committing treason

and outlying himself with the German intelligence, Galen system, to take over the world, Roosevelt

died just before he could learn that fact.

And so immediately with his death, the Dulles faction took over with a single-minded imperialism

that had been followed steadily.

Great stuff.

I'm getting told that the audio is a little bit wonky, but I guess we're just going to

have to keep going here.

I don't know what's wrong.

This is why we're trying to buy new equipment.

Okay.

Where was I here?

Okay.

Nick says, "Hey guys, say a guy lost the ability to ejaculate and then also slowly over a period

of a couple of years was also basically unable to get an erection.

What things would be the most important to look into?"

Doing blood tests would be very useful to see what your cortisol and estrogen, DHEA,

testosterone and thyroid and testosterone are doing.

Great.

Yeah, I want to add to that that sometimes doctors will just test the testosterone, but

several large human studies show that you can have erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory

problems and fertility problems, even in men with normal levels of testosterone and DHEA,

as long as either prolactin or estradiol are either elevated or in the top 25th percentile

of the "normal" range, which we know it's not really normal.

Great stuff, guys.

Thank you.

Okay.

This one's another from Nick and he says, "My heart rate is in the low 50s while sitting,

but while standing and also resting, it's in the 80s.

Should the sitting be close to the 80s causes?"

I think it should be higher than that, unless there's some reason.

If you have a really big heart, it can pump a lot of blood with pulses as low as 50, but

ordinarily you aren't pumping enough blood to keep things in very good health if it's

running that slow.

And that would just be a general sign of hypothyroidism?

I think so.

Great stuff.

Okay, Space 99 Yak says, "Is the herb Boutilla Superba Root good for DHT?"

I've never heard of it.

Any thoughts, Dr. Ray?

I'd have to look it up.

I mean, I don't know.

I've heard of the herb, but I don't know through what mechanism it would be good for

DHT.

I know nettle root is actually a drug in Germany and they're using it to treat prostate problems.

And they kept saying for years that, "Oh, it's because it lowers the androgens."

And then it turned out it actually contains aromatase inhibitors and is raising DHT instead

of lowering it.

Great stuff.

Okay.

This one's from Gaza Mongo and they say, "Can the thyroid be damaged with exogenous T3?

Is the feedback loop shutting the thyroid down activated by a certain amount daily or

per dose?

I.e., could small doses be additive rather than a replacement?"

If you get as much thyroid function as you need, the gland should adjust itself.

It's always responsive to signals such as adrenaline and TSH.

You can shut the TSH down completely and then if you stop shutting it down with the large

doses, it pops back very quickly.

I've seen my own thyroid gland when I was taking 50 micrograms of T3 per day.

I developed holes about as big as my index finger on each side of my Adam's apple between

that and the muscles.

And so I stopped taking the T3 for just a day or two and immediately within 24 hours,

my neck had leveled out.

The gland swells and shrinks according to need.

So a lot of doctors will talk about suppressing or damaging your thyroid gland by supplementing

because their reasoning from what happens to your adrenals or testicles if you overdose

on one of the hormones, high cortisol or glucocorticoid use can cause your adrenals to shrink to

the point that if you suddenly stop the supplement, you might die from the absence of adrenal

production.

But the adrenals will gradually over about a month recover if you are well nourished

after you've totally suppressed them with too much cortisol.

The thyroid gland only takes a day or so to completely recover.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Kana?

I have a question about pregnenolone and the adrenals.

As you know, Ray, the older studies in the early 20th century showed that when you give

people under stress pregnenolone, it decreases their output of 17 ketosteroids.

Isn't that a sign of potential partial adrenal suppression by pregnenolone or is it simply

giving them a break?

I think it's applying whatever function they were producing so they aren't needed.

In the study of rats, they measured their cortisol production and other hormones and

found a normal variation.

Most of them were normal.

A few were hyperproducers of cortisol but they gave them, I think it was 10 grams of

injected, a stomach full of powdered pregnenolone and then studied their hormones.

There were no endocrine changes that they could detect except in those which had been

under stress with high cortisol production.

Their cortisol went down to normal receiving those gigantic doses of pregnenolone.

So the person basically that's under a lot of stress, pregnenolone, doesn't just have

an anti-cortisol effect but it also gives the adrenals what they need, gives the adrenals

a break, I guess for lack of a better word.

Yeah, the adrenals and gonads are potentially self-regulating.

The pituitary is just there for an additional boost.

When Han Selye was experimenting with removing adrenals, he found that after the tissue-stored

steroids had dissipated, just a moderate amount of stress would kill the animals because they

didn't have the adrenal resilience to meet the stress where the ordinary rat would die

from a little bit of a stressful situation.

He noticed that the pregnant rats didn't even notice, had no ill effects from an increased

adaptive stress and so he experimented removing the adrenals and supplementing progesterone

and they lived a normal lifespan with no adrenal hormones at all.

Progesterone supplement totally replaced all of the adrenal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol

in particular.

Have you seen any studies that discuss the effects of pregnenolone specifically on the

pituitary?

I know there are a lot of studies by Selye and others.

Only that old 1950s study in which cortisol was corrected.

So you think pregnenolone does have a direct effect on the pituitary?

Yeah, the same way that any anti-stress substance, progesterone or sugar or aspirin for example

will stop the exaggerated pituitary activity.

Great stuff, thanks for that guys.

Okay, this one's from Joshua and he says, "My wife is 24 years old experiencing low

libido and hot flashes after having our second child.

What can be done to bring her sex drive and energy back?"

Generally, thyroid is the thing that you have to check the whole nutritional pattern.

Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D interferes with your mitochondrial energy production

regardless of your thyroid status.

So drinking milk, taking vitamin D, drinking orange juice and maybe supplementing thyroid

would be the usual thing to do.

Thanks for that, Ray.

This is from Kana for 2,440 yen and she provides a sticker and I can't really tell what's

going on there.

Thank you for that, Kana.

No question there.

Okay, so Space 99 Yak says, "Your thoughts on how to reverse the aging process and increase

health span.

The basics and advanced stuff that you might not talk about as much."

Carbon dioxide, very important for stopping the stress and degenerative processes and

vitamin D, calcium and thyroid and progesterone are part of their function is to normalize,

optimize the balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid.

I have a question about carbon dioxide.

You talk about in your articles, it's actually a Lewis acid and you also talk about partial

oxidation, putting the cell in an oxidized state.

It has a structure similar to the quinones.

It's much simpler but it does have those two carbonyl groups.

I'm not aware of any direct reaction in the organism where carbon dioxide actually directly

takes an electron and becomes reduced in the process.

How does its electron withdrawing function work in the organism?

The inductive effect, wherever it's attracted to an electron rich area, those electrons

sort of bulge towards the Lewis acid that has an electron attracting effect.

The bulging of those electrons by induction through the carbon chain reduces the electron

availability two or three carbons down the line.

The whole electronic quality of the whole protein molecule is affected in a shift towards

positivity or relative electron deficiency.

When you're full of CO2, all of your proteins have that shift and the flavonoids from orange

juice and milk and lots of fruits and vegetables, they can, by partial oxidation, like vitamin

C inside the cell, becomes oxidized and then becomes an electron recipient.

The flavonoids become similar electron attractors and shift the whole structure of the cell

into that relatively partial electron deficient state.

That affects, through the inductive effect, one protein has its influence on surrounding

proteins.

So the whole system is a cooperative electron slightly deficient condition, an acidic condition.

In other words, the whole cell turns into an acid.

So a more specific example, let's say you have a molecule of NADH, the reduced version

of NAD, it's the electron carrier.

So the presence of high amounts of carbon dioxide, would they be able to directly oxidize

NADH back into NAD or would they have a more indirect effect?

Indirect, shifting the whole system, activating the electron transport chain, turning off

lactic acid production, shifting the balances everywhere towards reducing lactic acid and

NADH and glutathione, shifting it towards the oxidized balance.

And the flavonoids, looking at their structure, they actually are capable of becoming fully

electron withdrawing agents, right?

They will actually be able to oxidize the NADH back to NAD.

Yeah, that seems to be why things like fisetin have an anti-aging effect.

They turn off the inflammation and stress excess of electron production.

And one of the ways you have to think about it is that this isn't a static condition,

it's a pressure of electrons flowing.

There are electrons in motion between the energy source and the electron consuming cytochrome

oxidase.

So if you think of the Venturi effect in gas or water, the pressure goes down as the speed

of flow increases.

And so what thyroid and these pro-oxidative substances do is to accelerate the flow of

electrons, decreasing the risk of random lipid proxidation by escaped electrons because

as the flow increases, the pressure, electronic pressure decreases.

So the whole cell becomes shifted away from electrons towards oxidation.

So in theory, combining carbon dioxide, whether, I mean, raising carbon dioxide and having

the presence of these direct electron withdrawing agents would be even more therapeutic.

Yeah, so I don't think anyone knows what the upper limit of oxygen consumption is, but

health and longevity, as far as anyone has tested, will increase as that flow rate increases.

Have you seen that recent study on fisetin being a very effective senolytic, I think

is the word, senolytic chemical?

Yeah, I think it's more than that.

I think it can actually correct the inflammatory process and not have to kill the cells.

Do you think things like naringenin, apigenin, other similar flavonoids would have similar

effect?

Yeah, a lot of them have been tested, for example, for preventing or treating radiation

sickness, the ultimate in electron excess disease.

And they're very powerful in protecting against or curing radiation injury.

So it sounds like a glass of orange juice and a little bit of vitamin B1 would be a

great combination as an anti-aging agent.

Yeah, probably every few minutes a glass of orange juice.

Great stuff.

Thanks for that, guys.

Okay, Space99Yak, or you know what, there's another one about ivermectin.

We kind of already talked about that, but they say, "Can ivermectin help protect against

the harms of the spike proteins modified by the AstraZeneca DNA vaccine by occupying spike

protein receptors?"

I don't know if that connects between ivermectin and the receptors.

We said earlier that was a risky substance, and so it's like combining two risky substances

together, basically.

I think a safer method would be trying to raise the levels of the ACE2 enzyme, because

that's what the spike protein binds to, if I'm not mistaken.

Right, that's the medical establishment got it exactly backward, and the things that increase

the ACE2 substance and the 1-7-antitransfer fragment, which is the result of ACE2 action.

Those are increasingly recognized as the therapeutic and curative agents.

And so everything that we know of as protective against COVID involves the increase of the

1-7-antitransfer and the ACE2 enzyme that produces it.

I found a very interesting study showing that progesterone directly increases, and quite

dramatically, the levels of ACE2, while at the same time lowering the amount of ACE.

So it should have like a double punch effect, like protecting both from COVID and potentially

the spike protein.

Of course, there are many other bad things in the vaccine, but I think progesterone seems

promising based on that study for protection against at least the virus.

Yeah, and it's safe to use all the time, preventively.

Do you think it may help?

I mean, I know there are studies about progesterone and influenza.

Have you seen any studies about progesterone and other viral particles?

Yeah, it actually has some antiviral or anti-replication effects, stabilizing the cell, makes the virus

not have any support for replicating.

Thanks for that.

Okay, Space 99 Yak says, "Any way of getting rid of acne scars?"

Depends on the scars, like if it's still inflamed, sort of like a slight keloid, vitamin E and

progesterone applied to it can shut off the production of inflammatory things like estrogen

and nitric oxide and restore the tissue to more or less normal so it loses the inflamed

appearance.

I have another thing to add.

There's a human study showing that a 4% niacinamide solution, separate studies actually, one used

4% niacinamide solution in water.

The other one used 1% aspirin solution in water.

Both of these help to reduce the formation of scars, even in severe acne.

I think combining them into one solution, 4% and 1% would probably work even better.

Great stuff.

Okay, this is from Ellie and they say, "Morning temps not budging, but day temps improves

on thyroid."

Why?

Morning temps not budging, but day temps improves on thyroid.

So they're taking thyroid, they're...

Go ahead.

That's pretty good.

While you're lying in bed, hypothyroidism isn't doing so much damage.

So the important thing is to keep the numbers optimal and steady during the daytime.

Thanks for that.

Thanks Ellie.

Thanks Ray.

Janet Pack, again, another...

A lot of these people are chronic supporters of the show, but she just sent a sticker for

$50.

Thank you so much, Janet.

DBO514 for $10 says, "Get yourself some gear, son."

Thank you so much, DBO514.

Kirk says, "What's the best strategy for someone with diabetes with swollen purple legs and

significant water retention?"

Thank you all.

I would start with vitamin D, getting adequate calcium, normalizing thyroid progesterone

and pregnenolone.

And then when you get your metabolism steady and some of the edema reduced, then shifting

the diet chronically, probably decreasing total protein somewhat to keep your total

fat intake lower.

Any kind of reliance on fat for energy is going to interfere with your sugar use and

the thyroid and calcium and vitamin D are going to help restore your ability to oxidize

glucose.

Thanks Kirk.

Thanks Ray.

Teresa and Diana both sent super chats, but no questions.

Thank you, Diana.

Thank you, Teresa.

Another one from Space Jack.

They say, "Best med/supplements to increase mitochondria and mitochondrial function."

Carbon dioxide is essential and very powerful for that.

And so all of the things that support oxidative metabolism are going to shift you towards

the better supply of carbon dioxide.

And the antitension inhibitors are starting to be recognized as supporting mitochondrial

energy production, reducing inflammation and degeneration.

So the boutique supplement of breathing into a bag.

Yeah.

Okay.

Kirk has another question here.

He says, "My 67 year old mother has one 1.2 centimeter nodule on her thyroid.

Her TSH is 2.5, free T4 1.0.

However, her TPOAB is 32.9 IU/ML, which is well beyond the 5.5 limit.

What would you suggest to correct the nodule?"

Thank you.

Which one was high?

TPOAB, thyroid peroxidase.

Is that what it is?

TPOAB, 32.9.

Oh, correcting the, getting the TSH down to something like 0.4 would be tremendously helpful.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Thanks, Kirk.

Cornelius says, "Any thoughts on how to treat excess saliva?

It happens whenever I eat, I get massive excess saliva.

Foods high in choline, eggs, et cetera, are a lot worse, I think.

It is a cholinergic crisis."

Often getting your thyroid going helps to shift your balance towards sympathetic adrenaline

activity and suppress the parasympathetic.

Thanks for that, Cornelius.

Thanks, Ray.

Zachary says, "16 year old, breast cancer, received radiation, had a lupine, lumpenectomy,

had a couple, had a couple lump scars since now, lump scars since.

Now 19, what remedies would you recommend to help prevent it coming back?"

Lower estrogen/corazole?

Sure.

Thyroid, vitamin D, and aspirin are very powerful protectants against estrogen and cancer development.

Thanks for that, Zachary.

Thanks, Ray.

Cornelius has another one.

He says, "Does Ray have any thoughts as to why taking supplemental T3 may cause a negative

change in body odor?"

Negative being worsening?

That's what I assume.

Yeah, it can increase your sweat production.

Just taking one or two showers with 10% sulfur soap can eliminate permanently a bad balance

of bacteria on your skin and can make a difference in the odor of your body, the sweat for a

long time.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Thanks, Cornelius.

David says, "What are your opinions on nicotine as a pro-metabolic substance and is there

some overlap with nicotinamide?"

No, I don't think there's any overlap that I've ever run across.

What about you, Georgi?

Do you know of any overlap?

I don't know of any overlap.

I think there is some evidence that nicotine in low-dose, well, actually, there's some

studies showing that it's a powerful aromatase inhibitor and there's some other components

of tobacco leaves such as cotinine, which is structurally similar to nicotine, but they

all seem to activate the adrenergic, the sympathetic system when overdone.

The animal studies that I've seen that showed protection for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's

disease, heart disease, and cancers, they use the equivalent of one to two milligrams

daily, which is half a cigarette.

I think most people that use the nicotine gums or the patches, they consume drastically

more and it becomes very quickly becomes a stress agent.

At least that's what I've seen.

On the excess saliva question, I should have mentioned that the things that promote the

sympathetic system, such as atropine or even the anticholinergic effects of cyproheptadine

and the antihistamines are likely to help.

Great stuff.

Thanks for that, guys.

Awesome.

Okay, Victoria says, "How do I lengthen my menstrual cycle, both follicular and luteal

phase?

I'm 26 years old and my cycle ranges from 23 to 29 days with 26 being the average."

That seems close enough, but increasing the thyroid level will lower the estrogen and

sometimes that will make it click into a very standard 28-day cycle.

I've never seen any bad effects associated with a variation of only 26 to 29 days.

Great stuff.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Okay, our buddy Comrade James for $30, "US, but no question."

Thank you, Comrade James.

Francis Bacon Cheeseburger says, "Recommendations for daily progesterone routine for a male

in their 30s?"

If you don't have any symptoms, I think just a drop or two of progesterone or maybe 5 milligrams

has a probably protective general stamina increasing effect.

We get a lot of people saying they're taking, men taking 20, 30 milligrams, you know, like

in they seem to be doing really well on it and that seems to be some, George and I are

both constantly inundated with that anecdote.

So that is very interesting.

Yes, sometimes that's enough to shrink a man's penis temporarily, but for others, because

it inhibits conversion of testosterone to estrogen, sometimes it's powerfully libido

promoting pro-testosterone, but it's very individual.

I get emails all the time from men over 50 saying that they're using 100 milligrams from

progesterone and they recovered their morning erections, which they had lost like 20 years

ago.

Very good.

Thanks for that, Ray.

And thank you, Francis Bacon Cheeseburger.

Okay, I think that's the same question we already talked about with James.

Zach says, "Do people typically experience negative symptoms during the process of reducing

endotoxin, cortisol, serotonin, or estrogen, i.e. getting worse before they get better?"

I always doubted that.

That's an old medical trick.

I give you my personally compounded drug and you get very sick.

That's evidence that it's curing you.

When you get sick after a vaccine, that's evidence that it's working, they are saying

now.

But that's been a constant, centuries-old ploy of the medical industry to say you have

to get worse before you get better.

Yeah, when they cut, burn, or poison you, you're going to get worse first.

Or at least they're saying, "Look, we actually gave you something that does have an effect.

It's not a placebo."

Isn't there like a name for this?

I think it's called like a Hertzheimer reaction or something like that?

Yeah, that's basically the same thing, a medical invention to defend the harm they do.

So the heroic therapy for cancer is basically an extreme version of that.

They kill you in order to save you.

Yeah, the statistics show that the survival rate has never been improved by surgery, radiation,

or chemotherapy as a whole.

Individual studies are constantly showing it.

But if you added up the thousands of individual evidence of benefit, it would be very strange

that on the whole population you see, if anything, a slightly worsening of the outcome.

I'm just refreshing my page here so I can get more of the super chats.

Who was the guy, Harry Rubin, Henry Rubin, the guy that went across the world and he

found that treating cancer was of no value at all, at least by standard medical procedures?

Yeah, I was at a seminar, 1969 I think, a world conference on the immune system.

He and a beginning Oregon instructor in biology were the only truth-oriented people there.

All of the big shots from around the world were there and they were all doing their phony

thing.

And Harry Rubin and this young professor, no one listened to them very much, but they

actually had facts and supported evidence and interesting stories that showed the falseness

of what all of the immunologists were doing.

Amazing.

We have about 30 more minutes here, so we'll rush through these, not rush through, we'll

try to get through as many questions as possible.

Ray, Peat, thank you so much for doing this.

Sincerely appreciate it.

Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much for being my partner in crime and always doing all of

these and making the show what it is.

So thank you to both of you guys.

Thank you for our amazing listenership, which is extremely dedicated and loyal and sincerely

appreciate all of you guys so much.

Okay, so Jordan for $5, no message.

Thank you so much, Jordan.

Elliot Cactus says, "How is THC and CBD understood in the bioenergetic view of health?

Any recommendations, dietary supplements/drugs/lifestyle for regular marijuana users?"

Oh, THC, was that the question?

Yeah, how is THC and CBD understood in a bioenergetic view?

I've been looking for the real beneficial effects and it's always very ambiguous as

far as I can see.

It is sedative and in some circumstances anti-inflammatory, but not always.

And for many years I haven't been able to resolve the ambiguity to have a definite opinion.

Thanks for that.

Elliot, go ahead.

One more thing for me to add.

A study from 2017 came out, demonstrated that pregnenolone can antagonize most of the intoxicating

effects of marijuana, which is probably not what people are looking for.

They're trying to get high on it.

But also animal studies subsequently show that it can protect from some of the anti-androgenic

effects and estrogenic effects of marijuana as well.

So I guess if somebody is using heavily marijuana and wants to continue to use it, which I don't

think is a good idea, but if that's their thing, the human equivalent of about 30 to

50 milligrams of pregnenolone based on the mouse study seems to be able to block most

of the negative effects and some of the positive if sedation is your thing.

Thanks for that guys.

Appreciate it.

Okay, David, boy for $4.99.

No message.

Thank you, David.

Jordan.

Okay, this might've been his question.

He says, "Preparing for dark days ahead, what supplements should my wife and I have on hand

and how do you recommend storing us dogs, chickens living in MN?"

Is that in Minnesota?

Minnesota.

Yeah.

Dark, dark days in what sense?

IE, cyber attacks, BLM infiltration in your home.

You know, I guess all the things we're chronically talking about.

Food chain.

Yeah, food chain disruptions and things like that.

Having some stable calorie supplies and some protein, if the crisis comes, you're going

to want to share your supplies with the people who didn't stock up so the quantity that you

put away should be economical and long lasting.

We happen to have a barrel or two of coconut oil and it's always good to have a few 20-pound

bags of sugar and maybe 40 pounds of gelatin powder on hand.

Great stuff.

Great suggestions.

KBP.

Quick question about the food.

Have you seen, Ray, have you seen that Walmart sells this thing called Astronaut food supply

and they're basically commercializing what NASA did in the '70s.

Basically it's powdered eggs, dehydrated milk, sugar, and I think they have some kind of

a starch, which I don't remember what the source of that was, but basically they claim

it's a complete diet that can last for a century at room temperature and they're selling three

months, six months, 12-month supplies.

Do you think there's any value in getting those dehydrated eggs and milk or do you think

it's dangerous?

I've always wanted to have a good supply of powdered milk on hand, but I've been having

trouble finding out exactly how they prepare the particles that don't clump and I've been

afraid that they're using nanoparticles as anti-clumping agents and so for the present

I would not rely too heavily on that.

What about evaporated/condensed milk, which is sold in cans?

You're basically getting the equivalent of a gallon of milk in a small can?

Yeah, I think that's good to have.

The can might eventually deteriorate, but it'll last quite a while and maybe some canned

sardines.

Great stuff, thanks for that.

Okay, KBB for $9.99, no message, thank you so much KBB.

New Health again says, "I seem to get a low, a lump in my throat feeling and itchy spots/hives

on my body from Cynomel/Cynoplus.

Any solutions?"

How fast was it taken?

That's sometimes the problem.

If you try to correct the problem in just a few days or a week, that can cause the gland

to shrink so much that you get discomfort in your throat.

Interesting.

And we talked about it a little bit earlier, I think this is probably worth clarifying,

how much do you think is too much at one time with food?

For a T3?

Yeah, T3.

With a meal, 10 micrograms is probably the maximum that you want.

Otherwise it shouldn't be over 5 micrograms at a time.

The meal will spread it out quite a bit and make it a steadier supply.

And last question for me, would you feel confident swallowing that tablet that it would dissolve

in the stomach or would you chew it?

Oh, I always chew any tablet.

It helps you know somewhat what it's made of.

Is there any benefit in taking thyroid with fat, the long chain fats, in order to go through

the lymphatic system instead of mostly going to the liver?

I think as it digests, it's going to distribute itself.

The amino acids that are more hydrophobic might get taken up in the chylomicrons.

Great stuff.

Thanks for that, guys.

Okay, Tom says, "I've had numerous people note the development of varicose veins with

pregnenolone and progesterone use.

Please could Ray comment on this?

Thanks all."

I would question the quality of the supplement used first because their biological functions

are just the opposite.

I've seen horribly bulging veins normalize in an hour with a big dose of progesterone

and more slowly with many big doses of pregnenolone.

I think someone who got bad products reported that and started people thinking about it

and then if they don't get immediate improvement, they think they might be getting worse.

I wanted to add something to that.

It's very important to make the distinction between varicose veins and more well-defined

veins.

Sometimes people when they have edema, you can't even see the veins, even the contours

on their hand or their legs and when they take progesterone or pregnenolone, the edema

rapidly decreases and then the veins become more visible.

That's not the same as varicose veins.

I've never seen a person develop varicose veins from pregnenolone or progesterone.

Yeah, the effect when you get enough is exactly the opposite.

For example, a big vein known to be so bulging that it can't possibly have any valve action

with a very big dose of progesterone, the muscle can be activated to the point that

the vein narrows and the flaps of the valve on each side of the vein can then reach each

other and close off the flow.

What would you consider a big dose in that context?

It depends on how high your estrogen is.

If a person has very high estrogen, it might take 400 milligrams of progesterone, but that

amount would knock some people out.

And we're talking orally, right?

Yeah.

Okay.

Do you think there's any benefit in taking a lower dose orally to avoid the sedation

and rubbing, I guess, the other half on the actual vein?

Yeah.

Putting it optically on while taking a moderate dose is probably the best approach.

Great stuff.

Andy Congo says, "Any critique on the croissant diet?

Claims SCD1 causes obesity and sugar raises that.

It's a low PUFA, super high saturated fat diet."

Whose diet?

What diet?

There was a study showing eating a ton of French croissants, which basically were baked

with almost fully saturated fat, but also, of course, a lot of starch in them, led to

a drastic weight loss and improvement in health.

The sucrose itself, some experiments show that you can increase the metabolic rate by

20% just with sucrose.

And so when you do it just right, sugar is a very powerful weight loss instrument.

Great stuff.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Okay, we're heading to the end of our time here, but I'll keep reading these.

KT has no message.

Thank you so much, KT, for your donation.

Yodi the Wodol says, "Alcohol in terms of capitalizing on the social libidinal economy.

I recently realized I wasn't drinking enough.

What amount is best for lipofuscin?"

I wasn't drinking enough.

That's great.

Vitamin E is known to be fairly effective at clearing up lipofuscin.

Progesterone is effective.

The amount of alcohol that can clear it up is very small.

Something like a gram or two a day is enough to have a helpful effect on lipofuscin.

Space99yak again says, "Georgie said the outer layer of the adrenal gland atrophy.

Is there any way to reverse that if that happens to someone and any way of knowing if it has?"

Adrenaline and progesterone both help to protect the adrenals so they can regenerate.

What I meant by that comment was that with aging, the layer that produces DHEA and pregnenolone

tends to atrophy and then the only one that remains is the cortisol producing one.

Ray, what was that guy?

He has a series of excellent papers on this subject.

I think Parker, do you know who I'm talking about?

He studied this in depth.

He doesn't ring a bell.

No worries.

Okay, last few questions here.

Spencer says, "30 male, low total cholesterol, 116 to 119 and low DHEA for the last 10 years.

Got the cholesterol up to 166, cutting starch, using the carrot salad, increasing sugar,

fructose and calcium.

Have all hypo symptoms, but my temps and pulses are normal.

Any advice?"

Why?

Not on any thyroid.

What kind of symptoms are hyper?

I'm not sure what that means.

Maybe I misspoke.

He said hypo.

I think this person had gynecomastia.

I think he had thinning hair and I think he had a kind of classical, I can't remember,

maybe constipation as well, but kind of like classical types of hypo symptoms.

And temperature was normalized?

I think he was reading them on a, they were higher like through the day, but in general,

I think this person felt terrible.

Checking for anything pro-inflammatory in the diet would be a first step to see if the inflammation

was interfering with their function.

Wouldn't sometimes very high cortisol and serotonin produce like a high body temperature

at the expense of destroying the muscles and everything else?

Yeah.

The stress hormones generally rise when your thyroid is low and it takes quite a while

when you're under stress to adapt fully to the thyroid supplement.

So Bruno Barnes over his career learned that it was best to aim for three or four months

for full correction with thyroid and people got so impatient, they think of correcting

efficiency as sort of a matter of a day or two, but it really, since the whole system

has to evolve in a different direction under the better energy supply, you should look

at the timescale of something like three months.

Yeah.

I think he has a whole section on that in his book, like what to expect and when, and

when changes will occur and when they won't.

Great stuff.

Okay.

Andrew Gassile says, "Thank you.

Tyromax is the bomb.

I can sweat again."

Thanks, Andrew.

Oscar Gomez for $5, but no message.

Thank you, Oscar.

MercyMe for $9.99, but no message.

Thank you, MercyMe.

Ben, he says, "Take more of my money."

Thanks, Ben.

Carlos Rangel for just a sticker, but no message.

Thank you, Carlos.

Carlin Brooks for $25, but no message.

Thank you so much, Carlin.

And let me just refresh this page really quick.

And while I'm doing that, Ray, what are you working on right now?

Not working on anything, but thinking about some of the old themes, giving them a new

perspective.

So, atherosclerosis and estrogen, for example, something related to that is going to be my

next newsletter.

Speaking of the older views, since Metchikoff was an embryologist, do you know of any field

in medicine or science in general that's still retaining some of those views and teaching

them to the younger generations?

No, they were all effectively erased from the profession by the mid-1950s.

And so, a few of the very young people are starting to look around and might be hope

for the future.

I can't believe this.

We're probably going to get through the questions here.

So, guys, we have 187 people watching.

Please give this episode a like.

I know it's arbitrary, but it really helps with the show.

Again, thank you to Ray for sitting here and being barraged by questions for two hours.

Sincerely appreciate it.

Thank you, Georgie Dinkov, again, my partner in crime, making this all possible.

So there's just a few more questions.

Maybe we can get through these and just call it a night.

Okay, so I mentioned Karlin.

This one's a scout.

And they say, "Do you think magnetofection could have been added to the COVID vaccine

to facilitate the mRNA getting into the cell?

Could that explain all the magnetic videos on the internet?"

I don't think they had to add anything.

The naked nucleic acids have no problem getting into cells.

I think they were calling the lipid coat a necessary way to get it into cells.

But when they've compared lipid-encapsulated DNA molecules with free DNA, in some situations,

the free DNA works better than the lipid-encapsulated forms.

And I think the real situation is likely to be that the so-called lipid carrier is really

a powerful adjuvant, a source of inflammation.

Thanks for that.

Another sticker from Fuhiha.

Thank you so much for that.

Peggy.

Hey, Peggy.

She says, "How to use progesterone to postpone menopause."

Thank you.

Oh, just using it cyclically is the important thing so that your liver doesn't get in the

habit of excreting it too fast.

So you have to lay off for one or two weeks every month and stay on cycle with it.

I've mentioned before that I met a gynecologist who was in his 70s and he had this very young-looking

wife.

He said that I've been giving her progesterone every month for 20 years and she's still menstruating

at the age of 63.

That's amazing.

Okay.

This one's from Nancy.

She just sends a sticker.

Thank you so much, Nancy.

Space99, yuck, again for...

He says, "The benefits..."

Talk about the benefits of allopregnanolone.

It's mostly what progesterone does.

It's one of the important conversion products in the brain, a neurosteroid.

And so everything we think of progesterone doing to mood perception, stability, stopping

seizures, helping with psychosis, it's really partly the effect of the allopregnanolone.

Amazing.

Thanks, Space99.

Thank you, Ray.

And the last...

All right, maybe we have three questions left.

This one's from Gregory and...

What is the time here?

Okay.

This one, Gregory says, "For the last few years, my father has developed excessively

dry palms to the point they crack and the flesh is exposed.

Doctors don't know what the cause is and just prescribe ointments.

Any ideas?"

Thank you, Ray.

Check his thyroid.

It's responsible for both sebum and sweat production in the skin.

If your thyroid is low, your skin almost invariably gets dry.

Okay, the absolute last two questions here, and then maybe we can talk about some cultural

stuff if you don't have to go, Ray.

But this is from Zach.

He says, "How to tell sugar is converting into carbon dioxide versus lactic acid?"

You feel very good.

You might feel panic and anxiety to the extent that it's turning to lactic acid.

Thanks for that, Ray.

Thank you, Zach.

Okay, the last question here.

Kirk, he says, "Hi, Ray.

I think I have heard you mentioned in a talk that 1,000 calories a day while still getting

all the RDA protein as well as for vitamins and minerals is an effective short-term way

to lose weight in the short term.

Any truth to this?"

Yeah, it isn't good for your health if you have to lose weight.

Keeping the minerals up is very important.

Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium are very protective against too much of the

stress reaction.

I just have a related question.

They're now starting human studies with the drug RU486, which you have an article about

mentioning that drug, Ray.

And it's basically, even though it's known as the abortion pill, it was developed as

a cortisol blocker.

That was its original design and purpose.

And now they're having several clinical trials showing sustained, rapid and sustained weight

loss by using anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams of that thing daily.

Do you think something similar can be achieved with progesterone instead of messing with

the diet and drastically reducing the calories?

Yeah.

Carefully adjusting your thyroid and progesterone and DHEA, pregnenolone, those can sustain

a very high metabolic rate, increased body temperature so that you burn calories much

faster.

So Dr. Bagniewski basically said, "How to burn fat while eating the Ray P. inspired

diet I gained 10 pounds."

And so it kind of intersects with what we were just talking about.

What should be the focus if a person is gaining weight?

Not to eat too many calories first and then to gradually shift towards a lower fat intake,

whatever keeps your temperature up without having an excess of calories.

And as your temperature stays higher, you'll be burning more calories and able to eat more

and more up to maybe 3000 calories a day for a sedentary person without getting fat.

Thanks for that.

And Goalie Ag doesn't have a question, but they donated $20.

Thank you Goalie.

And then Space Yak again donated more cash.

Thank you so much Space Yak.

We're going to call it there.

Ray, I don't like keeping you more than two hours.

Is there anything specifically interesting that you feel like needs a spotlight shined

on that's happened through medical or cultural or anything like that?

Or do you have to go and we can also just let you go?

Well, more and more kids are dying right after getting vaccinated.

So I think more people are starting to think in terms of murder rather than coincidental

deaths when they get sudden swelling of the heart that kills them.

I think the public is slowly starting to wake up.

Didn't the CDC like stealth edit their page or something and say that kids actually did

not need vaccine when they had been promoting the idea for a period of months or so?

Yeah, they said that very openly.

And then the reaction from the press was such that they erased it from their website.

And someone who mentioned the original statement that kids don't need the vaccination, his

comment was censored as contrary to Facebook's policy.

So in effect, the World Health Organization was censored by Facebook.

And people might not tolerate kids dying as much as they would just older adults.

Yeah, everyone is fine with when 80 or 100 percent of the people in the nursing home

die right after getting vaccinated.

But when a 13-year-old kid dies suddenly three days after his second vaccination, people

are starting to question authority.

And then this is not won't be surprising to you, but I did peruse a paper.

It was something like 84-year-old man autopsy after first Pfizer vaccine.

And the gist of the paper was something like all of his vital organs contained the, what

is it, like the RNA, the viral, the spike protein or something.

And so again, just more confirmation of everything you've been saying since March of 2020, that

this whole thing is a total charade and it's not localized and that it likely killed this

person like 18 days after.

And I guess this was like a landmark because it was the first autopsy of somebody who'd

been vaccinated.

Yeah.

And people should keep remembering that influenza was effectively wiped out by the surge in

so-called COVID deaths, meaning that the total pneumonia deaths didn't change.

Do you think, have you seen some of the new proposals in Congress and Senate to break

up and rein in big tech?

Do you think there's any, I don't know, honesty to these efforts or do you think it's all

a game?

To rein in what?

The big technology companies censoring people left and right and basically destroying society

as we know it?

It's hard to imagine that person surviving a breakup of the computer industry and Facebook

and Amazon.

That's such a totalitarian system.

I doubt that she's going to be able to accomplish anything.

So basically the empire really depends on for its survival on the big tech complex.

So any attempt to subvert that will probably be met with brutality.

I would guess so.

And then last question, any thoughts on impending cyber attack, you know, cyber polygon, the

world economic forum, it's going to happen next month and it's not rare for these things

to go live after a month or two, you know, is there anything you're doing right?

Like how would you survive if infrastructure and things collapsed?

After a while, I'm sure I would end up in Mexico.

But you don't really depend on the internet to live a productive life, do you?

No, not at all.

So it may be a blessing in disguise.

You'll simply go back to pen and paper and calling people on the phone and meeting them

in person.

Yeah, sort of hoping that that will happen actually.

Yeah, it'd be kind of counterintuitive for the system that sustains the ignorance to

be turned off.

But some people are saying people would go like psychotic within a week or two.

Do you think there's any truth to that?

No.

Well, unless you define psychotic as contact reality.

There may be a withdrawal period, a period of like abstinence or something.

But I also agree.

I think people will quickly discover how much they've been duped and how much they don't

want their internet connection back.

Yeah, including throwing away their cell phones.

Okay, great stuff.

I won't hold you any a bit longer.

Stay on the line.

We'll just say thank you again.

So Ray, thank you so much for doing this.

Georgie, thank you so much.

And we have an amazing listenership and I'll stay up after this and I'll do timestamps

for all these questions and things and sincerely appreciate all the support.

When you see us again, I think we'll have a souped up system and it will be very nice

and my computer won't be overheating and on the verge of collapse every single time we

do this.

So guys, thank you so much.

A special appreciation to Ray for just two hours answering questions.

And Georgie, thank you again and thank you to our amazing listenership and audience.

Have a safe weekend everybody and we'll talk to you guys soon.

Okay, take care.[silence]

[music]

[silence]

[music]

How about silently spraying epheromones on top of them and have the local bees chase them?

One minute. Guys, welcome to the show. Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.

Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov. Georgie, I interrupted you. Go ahead. What were you going to say?

No, I was saying instead of a stick, just silently spray them with like, because there's this odorless spray that they sell.

They're called bee pheromones. And you spray a few like a few sprays on their clothes.

And basically they will have every domesticated and wild bee and potentially hornets chasing after them no matter where they go.

Just for some context, I was asking Ray what he would do if, you know, if the pressure keeps tightening for vaccination.

I asked Ray what specifically he would do if somebody knocked at his door and what it would take for him to leave.

But yeah, I don't know what I feel like we haven't talked, you know, for a little while.

What you saw, the notion document that I sent you, is there any and we can go in any specific direction here.

You know, it doesn't matter. Is there any specific topic do you think is critical?

And, you know, we could fill the first, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes of the show with no nothing special.

I've still been thinking about the topic for the July newsletter.

I try to finish my thinking by around the end of the month for a newsletter.

And it's going to be something related to iron and calcification of tissues, stress and aging.

And these are themes that I got involved with more than 50 years ago.

But I see that there are just little glimmers of change and interest in the culture.

These are, again, timely topics. Age pigment and lipofuscin, for example.

For sure. I mean, that is something that's become more popular in the last year or two, just in general Internet land.

But even that's what you wrote about, you've been writing about for decades, you know, the inflammation, swelling, fibrosis, calcification.

You know, that seems to be incredibly misunderstood, you know, and so I wasn't sure if that was something worth addressing as well.

And that linked to the old newsletter, which I talked to you and said informed kind of this newest newsletter that you were thinking of.

Yeah, I see that. And I think it was 20 years ago that newsletter was concentrating on the connective tissue response to estrogen and stress.

And it talked a lot about the collagen surroundings of cells, which is one of the basic harms that stresses and estrogen activate.

And the people were really doing definitive research in the 30s, 40s and 50s.

And then that pretty much disappeared because it impinged on industrial profit motives.

The crude oil industry, the estrogen industry and various branches of the drug and medical industries.

So what's the typical medical view of fibrosis and how does your view differ?

I think the reason for all of the differences is that they're thinking in terms of the classical cell chemicals and enzymes enclosed in a barrier membrane and the signals as being reductionist signals.

So 50 or 60 years ago, someone named Schwartau, I think it was C-H-B-A-P-A was his name,

found that hypoxia and estrogen created the conditions to produce fibrosis by collagen synthesis.

And following his perceptions, I've tended to think in terms of global stresses and the functions where the standard medical thing is to think in terms of a concrete signal like an irritant or a pathogen that is creating the irritation and fibrosis.

And what really shaped my dissertation in 1970 to '72 was seeing that hypoxia, radiation, estrogen and excessive PUFA, all of these things created the same biochemical reactions.

On the cellular level, it was analogous to Han Selye's general adaptation syndrome on the level of the organism.

Here's the local adaptation syndrome on the level of cells and tissues.

On a more basic level, can we say that fibrosis is basically the connective tissue equivalent of the lipid pathway for getting rid of excess electrons, unpaired electrons?

Except it doesn't get rid of them. It's a bad solution. It gets rid of them in the sense of killing off that part of the organism, walling it off, detoxifying it, but cutting it off from function.

So it's like a dead storage for electrons, basically.

Yeah, separating the area of damage like a lizard throwing off its tail.

So would fatty acid synthesis precede fibrosis, basically? Would it be like a less suboptimal way of getting rid of these excess electrons?

Oh, yeah, I guess that's a more physiological way. You just blow up with fat instead of calcifying and cut off a part.

Right. So it seems like people gaining weight during middle age, it's a very common process.

And then fibrosis and deterioration and essentially losing muscle mass and getting saggy tissue and whatnot and skin looking like a cowhide.

That's basically seems to be the process that happens later on if metabolically things are not recovered.

Yeah, it's doing on the systemic, organic, whole organism level what the local fibrosis does.

It's preserving the organism at the expense of losing its functional tissue such as muscle, replacing it with fat.

And exactly the same processes are involved. Intense calcification will cut off an area, turn it to stone.

And the process of aging is very, very slow turning to stone.

It involves calcification but in a diffuse way that increases inflammation as it lowers function.

But the whole organism goes down more or less in a coordinated way rather than calcifying your ears or your pituitary or some particular tissue.

And the calcium initially gets there with the intent to help because the cells need it as an anti-inflammatory.

But if the cells are de-energized, then calcium starts to accumulate too much.

And then I guess under the influence of parathyroid hormone starts to form this, it starts to become part of the fibrotic tissue. Is that correct?

Yeah, the parathyroid hormone is working by amplifying the de-energized situation that starts it all.

And something I noticed in the 60s, it turns up over and over in the old microscope literature,

is that calcium deposits generally involve, when you're staining the tissue, if you use stains for iron,

you'll see an association of iron with all of these little calcium deposits.

And that's where it really gets interesting how the whole organism is organized to protect against calcification and excess iron, uncontrolled iron behavior.

But you get a diffused iron activity along with diffused calcification in a gradual slow aging.

Or in a local area, you get both of them very intensely involved in essentially killing off and protecting against that damaged tissue.

What's the signal in the organism that decides between killing off and separating a particular tissue or organ, or turning into a tumor?

Is there a threshold, or is it more or less a chance event?

Adolf Farberg talked about that.

He pointed out that there's always a progression from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification.

And then somewhere along that line, some cells manage to survive in a damaged condition.

The tumor is a revolt of certain cells in the area that's being isolated and killed off.

Those cells decide to survive.

And since the organism didn't have the resources to prevent the loss of that calcifying area,

they are also likely to lack what it is that the escaping cells need.

And so although they escaped, they don't have the support from the organism to continue functioning as part of the organism.

So they were just an alternative deterioration, alternative to the calcified tissue.

So if somebody were to look at a solid tumor localized to an organ and analyze the tissue around it,

it should more look like concentric circles with the tumor in the center,

and then a layer around it, maybe calcification, and a layer further out, fibrosis,

and a layer further out, very inflamed, and a layer further out, be like basically glycolytic metabolism.

Is that something that's commonly found in tumors?

One of the common things is that a tumor itself will be turned off by calcification.

The body will wall it off and not let it go farther.

So calcification is basically a desperate attempt at walling off a metabolically deranged tissue.

Yeah, and it can do the same with invasive bacteria or parasites.

Is there a situation where this process is adaptive and should not be interfered with?

In other words, if you're lowering parathyroid hormone, is there a situation where the body says,

"No, I need that in order to wall that tumor off, and now you just lowered my parathyroid with calcium or like vitamin D,

so now I cannot get rid of that tumor"?

I think the better choice is to hope you can provide the energy and the vitamin D,

and suppress the anti-metabolic parathyroid hormone.

So this newsletter, obviously you implicate estrogen in the centrality of it all.

You mentioned also parathyroid hormone.

What other hormones are coordinating this low energy shift that's getting progressively worse as presumably the inflammation gets worse?

Prolactin is one of the next involved.

It involves serotonin and prolactin and aldosterone.

Eventually, growth hormone tends to be brought in as part of the failing tissue.

So like we talked about last time, the pituitary being roused in proportion to how bad the situation is.

Yeah, and serotonin generally activates too much pituitary activity.

And then the pituitary hormones intensify the inflammation.

First, they create intensified inflammation in the organ.

They're tuned to like gonadotropins create inflammation and eventually cancer.

The gonads, TSH, which activates the thyroid, eventually leads to all of these inflammatory hardening,

fibrotic processes and cancer of the thyroid gland.

So the pituitary hormones rouse the tissue, but without the resources to function, they lead to the same excitatory damage.

The prostaglandins and leukotrienes are also intimately involved, right?

If we consider them hormone-like lipids signaling?

Yeah, and since I don't believe in such a thing as essential fatty acids,

I see the whole doctrine of the ideology that has built up around the prostaglandins and other prostein,

the derivatives of arachidonic acid, I think shouldn't be there at all.

An Australian guy found the series of prostaglandin-like substances that are made from the mead acid,

omega-9 fatty acids, which we make if we aren't poisoned by external linoleic acid.

That series of N-3 and N-6 fats, we make basically singly.

The monounsaturated N-9 fatty acids produce that mead acid series of prostaglandin-like things.

This Australian, I think his name was Cleland, found that they are without exception,

that they're anti-inflammatory and constructive for all of the arachidonic acid derivatives end up being harmful.

I don't want to interrupt you, Gordie. Go ahead.

Let me see.

[Laughter]

I haven't got it. Go ahead.

I'm sure you've seen the studies, the older studies that essential fatty acid deficient rats heal their wounds without any scar.

Wouldn't that implicate PUFA as the cause of the scar formation and the fibrosis and everything else,

while the serotonin, prolactin, estrogen, etc., they're not innocent bystanders.

They're certainly contributing, but they're not the primary players here.

The derivatives of linoleic and arachidonic acid are amplifiers of the little bit of inflammation

that should trigger replication and repair.

If you had only the mead acid derivatives, they would take care of limiting the inflammation response.

As it is on our present environmental foods, instead the prostaglandins amplify the inflammation

and can't derange the healing process and make scar tissue or keloids or cancers.

Ray, something you're so good at is distilling the hormones down to their basic functions with a naming convention.

Estrogen, what did you call it, the hormone of new beginnings, or aldosterone, the brittleizing hormone.

What would you call serotonin, the pseudo-hibernation hormone, and then what would you call prolactin?

In fish, for example, it's a fluid regulating.

When a salmon comes from the ocean and confronts the absence of salt in the river water,

they have a kind of shock reaction, an estrogenic reaction, and put out a burst of prolactin,

which like parathyroid hormone, dissolves their bones and gives them an immediate old person humpback,

even though gravity doesn't bend their spine like it does in a human bending over with old age from osteoporosis.

The fish get an equivalent humpback as their skeletal deterioration is the prolactin,

which is handling this estrogenic excess of water, is at the same time pulling calcium out of their bones.

That happens under, for example, estrogen increases our water retention and imitates the condition of a salmon hitting fresh water.

The shock of that hypotonic condition turns on prolactin.

In terms of the whole fibrosis calcification, and first being an inflammatory process,

the prolactin is causing swelling under the direction of estrogen.

There's that like Striskov paper you quoted in one of your articles that said

one of the primary functions was to suppress oxygen consumption and lower the thyroid function.

It's maybe acting early on in the whole process from inflammation to fibrosis to calcification, or it's during the whole thing?

Yeah, like parathyroid hormone turns off oxidative energy production and shifts over to lactic acid production.

You get a substitution of protective carbon dioxide, which hardens the bone tissue and keeps soft tissue soft.

Instead, you get lactate, which softens the bone tissue and tends to calcify your arteries and other tissues.

Are estrogen and prolactin also involved in activating the stem cells in response to tissue injury?

And then carbon dioxide is supposed to kick in and differentiate them into normal organs,

but if that doesn't happen, then basically too many stem cells and you get cancer?

I think so.

Awesome. And then one thing we didn't touch on was the role of fibrin.

That seems like it kind of kicks things off and leaks out of the cell and causes havoc to other cells. Is that right?

Is it produced by the liver mostly?

Fibrinogen is produced in the liver.

Normally, there's a constant balance, a whole system of enzymes that produce fibrin and tend to form clots.

But this fibrin that is constantly being produced from the background of fibrinogen,

a very thin layer of it is normally deposited on the inside of capillaries,

giving them a little extra strength, like just a reinforcing film, and on the outside of red blood cells.

And one of the factors that governs the balance between this constant formation of a small amount of fibrin

and the constant breakdown thinning of that layer so it doesn't get too thick,

one of the main factors governing this balance is estrogen.

So a high estrogen person gradually gets thicker capillaries, linings, and thicker coating on the red blood cells,

making oxygen take longer to get out of the red cell and through the capillary into the tissue.

And probably just about every hormone we have is contributing to that balance.

Estrogen has been studied as a regulator.

And just recently, people are starting to see the D-dimer breakdown fraction of fibrin

that indicates how much stress there is, or in the case of estrogen,

it indicates how excessive your estrogen is because you have the enzymes,

proteolytic enzymes breaking down the coating so it doesn't get too thick.

And that is seen to be happening in a stress disease or a viral disease like COVID-19.

And so just checking the blood for the D-dimer is a way of seeing how much stress your system is under.

So basically it's a biomarker for clotting.

I didn't hear that.

It's a biomarker. It's a reliable systemic biomarker for clotting.

Yeah, and the regulators, several of the regulators of iron, for example,

high ferritin and high hepsidin, which is sort of a blocker of iron uptake.

Both the ferritin and the hepsidin levels are increased in COVID,

and that goes with the defect in the red blood cell iron physiology.

Did you see the recent study that came out that said vitamin E, specifically alpha-tocopherol,

drastically inhibits viral repression, specifically for COVID-19, for SARS-CoV-2.

Just 10 micromole per liter concentration basically obliterated the virus.

So it's a very interesting study.

And I'm wondering, since vitamin E also has anti-clotting effect, anti-estrogenic effect,

potentially even anti-serotonin effect, it may have additional benefits if COVID-19 is mostly a clotting disease.

Yeah. Have you read the Schutt family's works?

Evans Schutt was one of the sons, the father and two sons.

He was working on blocking the anti-fertility effects of estrogen.

And one of the effects of estrogen was exaggerated clotting of the blood,

and vitamin E in protecting against all of the effects of estrogen.

They followed up and showed that it would accelerate the removal of established blood clots

and various circulatory diseases and protect the heart from forming new clots.

And it turns out that estrogen is a basic pro-inflammatory activator.

Vitamin E as a very essential anti-estrogen factor is also a very fundamental anti-inflammatory agent.

It works at several levels to prevent prostaglandin toxic effects.

Does every viral infection involve inflammation in one shape or form?

I think so.

So that's why aspirin, vitamin E, progesterone, things like that, aside from any direct antiviral effects,

they're simply stopping the inflammatory cascade, which is really what eventually kills people if the condition is really severe.

Yeah, basically, we wouldn't be bothered by viruses getting churned out and produced and eliminated.

It's the inflammation that some of them produce.

So is it fair to say that, I mean, since we already discussed that maybe the evolutionary purpose of viruses is horizontal gene transfer, more or less,

then the only reason we get these viral diseases is simply our suboptimal health state, not that the viruses are necessarily trying to kill us.

Yeah, it's the same with our exosomes, the particles that we make as part of our repair, maintenance and development processes,

the communication of genetic material and proteins and hormones between cells for regulation and development.

The viruses are almost identical to our own exosomes.

They're made by the same machinery, are roughly the same size and structure and so on.

So when you're in a weakened state where you are susceptible to viruses and get exaggeratedly sick from a cold virus like COVID,

you're also likely to be having poor reactions to your own exosomes and a sick cell can put out sickness-communicating exosomes.

So a tumor can produce tumors by sending bad exosomes around the body.

I think that's a way of thinking of why viruses vary in their harmfulness.

So as you mentioned before, during stress, cells start shedding their retroviruses into the bloodstream.

Are these retroviruses just a simple, harmless signaling mechanism or can they actually cause issues?

You know the main theory that HIV is causing AIDS. It's been disputed many times since it's a retrovirus, right?

I mean, it's not supposed to be harmful for us.

Do you think there's any situation where these exosomes, retroviruses released by the cell during stress can cause issues?

Yeah, in the case of cancer, for example.

Cancer cell is a profoundly stressed cell and it sends out crazy alarm signals as exosomes.

Speaking of coronavirus, I wanted to talk about David E. Martin, Ray, who you've mentioned a few times on your more recent interviews.

But first, I wanted to talk about your newsletter.

So the newsletter is available by email now. It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal at raypeatswithansnewsletter@gmail.com.

And so we were talking earlier about your new newsletter, which should come out somewhere around the end of August. Is that right?

Oh no, I'm hoping to get it written this coming week and quickly mailed, so hopefully before the 10th of August.

Oh, amazing. Okay. And then same deal with raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And they can email that address to order from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular medicine, generative energy, my favorite, mind and tissue or nutrition for women. Is that also correct?

Right.

Perfect. And then I wanted to talk about Progest-E from Keenogen.

You can email Catherine to purchase Progest-E, keenogen@gmail.com.

And so something, you know, Ray, we talked about, maybe it's 2016.

I told you that I thought I was contributing to lots of my own problems by taking oral supplements.

And so since then, I've been much more partial to using topical, like oily substances on my skin.

So what do you think about using progesterone on your skin if somebody noticed that they had some kind of digestive irritation from it?

First of all, any vitamin E is, if it's pure, it's very viscous and has an unappealing taste.

And the viscosity going down your throat in a lot of people will trigger a retching reaction and can irritate just by its viscosity.

And so one solution is to mix it with butter or put it in your baked potato or whatever that prevents that concentrated oil reaction.

And that's a problem with lots of supplement people. People take their vitamins or minerals as tablets rather than as blended into their foods.

So apart from any impurities that are causing allergic reactions, just the fact of a pure chemical hitting your stomach can injure it to some extent.

But to lower the viscosity of the vitamin E so that it will go in your skin faster, you can add a little bit of olive oil on your skin first and then spread the viscous progesterone onto it.

And you don't want to mix it in the bottle because the extra olive oil tends to destabilize the solution.

But mixing it right on your skin, you'll get a much faster absorption.

Somewhere around 10% of it is likely to go into your body.

So it takes a bigger dose even on top of the accelerating olive oil.

One woman who had two rigid hands from arthritis, we experimented on her hands rubbing pure progesterone onto the back of one hand and adding some olive oil with progesterone to the other hand.

And in less than an hour, she could flex and have normal function in the hand that had the olive oil added to the progesterone.

It accelerates the absorption that fast.

I have another cool report about Progest-T.

One of your clients, female clients, who's been buying these bottles for her mom who has dementia, she's in her late 80s, and urinary incontinence.

And she emails me once in a while asking about why taking progesterone orally irritates her mom's stomach.

And we discussed several other methods.

And I suggested that she try a drop in each nostril.

And apparently that worked tremendously well.

And her mom is now back and taking care of herself.

And the urinary incontinence is gone.

And apparently she can get by just by using a single drop in each nostril, which makes the bottle last for months.

Do you have any qualms or misgivings about nasal administration of Progest-E?

With any oil in your nose, you have to be careful with the quantity because if it gets high enough that it can rain down into your lungs, oil in your lungs is something you absolutely want to avoid.

It's only one drop in each nostril.

She said that's plenty.

And it immediately puts her to sleep.

She sleeps through the night without waking up, without being her pants.

And apparently now both problems, dementia and incontinence, are gone just by one drop in each nostril.

Ray, can you critique my approach?

So for the last few years, I've been taking like an eighth of a teaspoon.

So that's like, what, 50 milligrams of progesterone and then whatever, how much I've mixed in with DHEA.

And I'm putting it from my knee to my ankle.

And I'll put the olive oil on first.

Do you think that's too much for an average-sized knee to ankle leg?

No, but that's about what I use.

And would you ever use more than one-eighth on one leg?

Oh, if I have a sore elbow or something, yeah, I'll put maybe a quarter of a teaspoon on it with some olive oil and cover it from shoulder to hand.

Get as much in as possible, as quickly as possible to get rid of the inflammation.

In order to improve the absorption, do you think it helps to like thoroughly clean the skin with rubbing alcohol before that?

After a bath, it really is good if you can soak your skin so that the top layer of skin comes off.

And then I know I've asked you before, it might have been on that 2016 Safe Supplements episode,

but with progesterone, like obviously if you were putting whatever the amount was, whatever teaspoon, half teaspoon or whatever,

that would be very sticky, right? But that doesn't mean you're wasting it.

If it's sticky, you would just be using more of it. Is that right?

Well, if it's noticeably sticky, it's going to go under your clothes and bedding, and it doesn't do any good on your clothes and bedding.

It ruins them.

If you rub it thoroughly, you won't see any stickiness or shininess left.

And that means a good proportion of it is far enough into your skin that it's getting into the blood.

Okay, interesting. I just do this every day. That's why I'm asking you so many questions about it.

But you don't need that much olive oil because you couldn't, if you use a lot of olive oil and the progesterone,

it'd be just like a shiny, slick type of skin, right?

Yeah, just two or three drops of olive oil for a leg is enough.

Okay, that's extremely good to know. Do you have any other questions, Roger, or we can move on?

Okay, so we have questions. We have some good questions that I thought would be interesting to bounce off of you.

Did you want to talk about David E. Martin? I thought, you know, what is there to say about all this stuff that's going on that hasn't been said?

And watching his videos, I thought were extremely interesting.

You know, his evidence, his hardcore evidence-based approach with the patents.

Is there anything that needs to be said about his work and what he's found?

Yeah, some people worry about his credentials and background and the fact that he wears several big rings.

And he seems to have studied oratory from Bob Hope and Jack Benny.

When you watch his delivery of profoundly disturbing information, he does a Bob Hope or Jack Benny pause.

He's extremely effective, but you just have to accept that he isn't a medical professor.

Well, it seems like he was like a double threat because he understood the law.

And then, I mean, everything I heard him, I only watched one or two videos of him, but everything he said, he seemed like he understood the science as well.

Yeah, obviously, it's extremely bright.

Yeah. And then in one of the, I don't know how to say the guy's name, the Reiner Fulmike,

but he, when they were talking in German and then he said he understood what they were saying, I was like, "Oh, this guy's pretty smart."

But yeah, and then in one of those videos, he was talking about a quote that Georgie and I talked about last week from Peter Daszak, you know, that, I mean, I know there are a lot of smoking guns in this, but do you know what quote I'm talking about?

He says, "We need to increase the public." I mean, that seems really like a smoking gun almost.

Yeah, if we get the media to hype the pandemic, the investor money will follow.

Those people, Ralph Berrick, the germ warfare virus designer, has commented on how much money they're going to get from this work.

So public money is the basic motivator as well as whatever evil germ warfare is involved.

And then towards the end of that quote, he says, "We need to use the hype to our advantage to get to the real issues."

And so, like, the real issues being what Eric Schmidt is talking about and what we talked about a little before we went live, the destruction of the legacy, so-called legacy systems and people's livelihoods and not wanting to compete and playing the empire game.

Yeah, what Eric Schmidt outlined in detail in 2019 was happening to a considerable extent already in 2020 with many billions of dollars lost by common people, working people and small businesses collapsing all across the country.

And all of that wealth being concentrated in Amazon and the drug companies, a few billionaires getting huge multiplications of their wealth while the traditional economics of people working and having their businesses was collapsing.

Exactly what Schmidt said had to be engineered for the US to get ahead of China by developing artificial intelligence to do the work rather than an ordinary human-based economy.

I have a question about China. I mean, yes, it does some good things for its people, but it seems like their system is not much different at its core. It's still the same thing. It's using people as assets without much care and worry about the individual person or allowing them the freedom to expand and live their lives meaningfully.

Yeah, they are just better capitalists than their opposition. They're using capital in a fairly arrogant way, but they're helping to eliminate poverty in China, and that will increase the productivity of their population.

So it's going to be profitable to the people invested in their industry. So it's not at all anti-capitalist. But the good thing about them is that they don't have hundreds of military bases around the world.

So they can pour these resources, at least for now, into their people until they decide otherwise maybe one day.

Yeah, but they have a history of several thousand years of not going abroad to enslave people.

And Ray, I apologize. I know we talked about this before we went live, but it might be worth mentioning just for everyone. So there's a quote. I think it came from an interaction with you with somebody from November 2020.

And you guys had a few back and forths, and one of them was, "Since RNA vaccines haven't been used before, there's no way of telling in detail, but there's no doubt that general immunity will be seriously damaged.

Looking at the dismal results of vaccination campaigns so far, I think it could reduce world population by 80 or 90 percent."

And so I posted that, and I thought it sounded like some people were saying it might have even been fake. And so is there anything to clarify with that?

It could reduce the population. It could annihilate every last human being. It could kill off elephants and wombats as well. But we just don't know how deadly it's going to be. It's already killed 18,000 people in Europe, something like 10,000 in the U.S.

They keep changing the numbers from 6,000 to 12,000 and back to 6,000 at the CDC. Anyway, it's verified that it is killing thousands, but the biology of it indicates that it could keep killing not just the acute first days and weeks and months, but that damaged the immune system.

It's fairly likely to accelerate all of the inflammatory aging processes, and there are even the mechanisms. For example, the vaccine is known to concentrate in the ovaries, and if it transmits that ability to produce spike protein to the next generation,

then the weakening of the biology of the offspring could mean that the longevity of that generation is drastically reduced. And so over a period of a few generations, what they're doing now, you can't foresee that it isn't going to kill off the majority of the species.

Did you see the study about the women who took the vaccine in the first or second trimester had 88, more than 88 percent of spontaneous abortions?

No, I didn't see that, but the World Health Organization for years has been advocating giving flu vaccine to pregnant women, and the vaccine has adjuvants intended to create systemic inflammation, and it's firmly established in animals and humans that inflammation during pregnancy causes damage to the fetus,

all degrees of damage, brain damage and shape of the organs and so on. So what they've been doing in pregnancy is a large scale crime. Now for them to do this experimental treatment on pregnant women is just hard to believe.

As far as the vaccines, I know the mRNA vaccine can get incorporated into our DNA, and there's even a study that came out demonstrating that it's possible. What about the DNA vector vaccines like AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson? Is the damage, is the risk to them mostly related to the inflammatory state that they cause for a few months while that foreign DNA is in the body?

Yeah, what form is their DNA? Is it in a different virus or a constructed virus?

I think they're basically taking, I mean, the mRNA vaccine has a synthetic portion of the spike protein, right? Synthetically created. And the DNA vaccines, the vector vaccines, I think they have, again, a synthetic version of a spike protein different from the RNA vaccine, but it's encapsulated into a chimpanzee adenovirus, and that's what they're using it to get it inside of the cell.

So I know there's horizontal gene transfer, so there's still the potential for this getting to be incorporated in our tissues, but probably less so than the mRNA, right?

Well, if the RNA gets into the cell, the same thing can happen to it.

Okay, so it doesn't matter that it's a vector vaccine, it's still that foreign protein that it carries, that piece of spike protein, it can still get incorporated?

Last thing before we move on to questions here, and I feel like you can't state your hypothesis enough, you know, because so many people are getting into your work. But anyways, I posted something from your 1994 Generative Energy book, and it was "More life and more energy can solve many of the basic problems of life."

And then I put Albert St. George's quote, it's like an abridged quote, but "The more life does, the more life it is." Dot dot dot. "Life supports life. Function builds structure, and structure produces function." Dot dot dot.

And I, again, you know, it's the core to a lot of things you're talking about. Is there anything more to say about that that hasn't been said?

Yeah, in one of his simple experiments on rabbits, he showed that progesterone allows the heart muscle, and by implication, other smooth muscles, allows the heart muscle to build structure.

So the function, the more the heart functions, the better the structure is, permitting a more adequate pumping action.

Seeing a concrete version of what you just quoted from him, that progesterone facilitates that energy and function, builds structure, and structure enables better function.

I love it. Thanks for that. And then, Georgie, unless you have another question, we'll just move on to these questions that I pulled.

It's more of a, I mean, it's an article that I saw that came out this week. It's related to Einstein and, I guess, another house of cards collapsing.

As Ray, you know, Einstein said, he replaced the ether with the space-time continuum, and he said, "We don't need the ether. This space-time continuum can do everything that the ether could do."

And basically, it has no properties. And now they just came out with a proof that electromagnetism is a basic property of space-time, which means that, I guess, Einstein was not proven wrong, but that the idea of this abstract, empty space that somehow is devoid of properties,

and I think that kind of gave the impetus to the development of a lot of abstract reductionist theories in the 20th century, that seems to be now on its way out.

Yeah, and you know, the Michelson-Morley experiment didn't show a null effect. It showed something like a 20% drag effect of the ether.

And then, I think it was Morley and Mitchell, I think, did the follow-up work for many years, over and over, doing the original experiment, but in more and more refined ways, in basements and on higher mountains and so on, showing that the earth does drag an ether with it, affecting the velocity of light according to the direction the earth is moving.

And I think there's one that NASA commissioned in the '80s, which for some reason is not getting much publication. Well, maybe because it confirmed the ether again. It's by a physicist, I think his name is Silverlight. I don't know if you've heard of him.

But he was a staff NASA physicist, and apparently the guy that they went to when they wanted to debunk really controversial claims, and he confirmed the ether again, and NASA got really angry and said that the reason for his results was abnormal temperature in the room where he was conducting the experiments.

Yeah, and those follow-ups to the Michelson-Morley experiment, carefully controlled for temperature, because that had been brought out as a defense of the space-time thing. And they absolutely showed that the temperature wasn't involved.

Ray, have you ever heard that NASA stands for not a space agency? I heard somebody said they say that in the CIA, but whatever. Okay, so here are some questions. Some of these are pretty heavy, and so feel free to talk about as much or as little about any of these as you want.

Georgie, were you going to say something? No. Okay, I thought you were going to point with your hand. Okay, this one's from Green, and they say, "He has many nutritional, physiological tools to improve metabolism. What kind of personality changes can be made? What is a healthy way to look at the world, or what is an unhealthy way to look at the world?"

I think it's important to get pleasure from looking at the world. Intrinsically, the process of being involved and learning from the world gives pleasure. Insight is pleasurable. And the attitude towards the world, that it's a place to be dutiful and do your work, that is a less healthy approach to reality.

Everything should be more or less spontaneous and fun and intrinsically motivating to continue in that direction.

I have a question about this. If attitude is largely the result of what the world and the environment allows our health to be, shouldn't we be not forcing a particular attitude? If the environment is crappy and oppressing us, isn't it normal to feel down? Isn't it abnormal to try to force ourselves into positive thinking in such situations?

Well, not force, but to find the route to get to the different state where you aren't being oppressed by the world.

Okay. The reason I'm bringing this up is because I'm sure you've seen when they get these terminally ill patients, they're trying to improve their suffering by doing humor as a therapy. And I always thought, "What a bizarre situation. Here are these people dying from cancer, some of them children, and then there's this clown, literally a clown, in addition to the other clowns in white coats, trying to make them crack a smile."

And you can see that they're suffering, they're struggling to smile, and they don't want to be entertained. It's not entertaining, they're in pain. So in situations like that, it's more natural. I don't know. I guess you can find other ways to improve their lives instead of forcing them to be happy. That would be pathological, right?

Great stuff. I had another follow-up question that I don't remember what it was.

Anyways, okay. So this one's from MGAthlete. They say, "Ray has mentioned process theology before. Can you ask to expand on how he has arrived at that and his experience with religion/church in his life?"

Well, my experience of the world right from the beginning was that it was a process that I was involved in, the nature of my being and the nature of other beings. Everything was obviously an ongoing process in which all of the entities were actually processes, rather than having any fixed points of reference.

Other than as part of a general picture that you're putting together. And then reading William Blake when I was 18, I saw that his orientation was essentially similar.

And then Alfred North Whitehead, right around the same time, went into details and he gave that name "process and reality," which that orientation is now called either "process philosophy" or "process theology."

And it's in place of all of the theological apparatus. It sees universe as processes at every point.

And that view, is it heretical in a biblical sense? Or is there things that point towards that? How did Griffin arrive at that? How do you still be religious and believe the Bible with that? I'm not saying you do that, but it seems disconnected from the Bible that I'm aware of.

Yeah, Griffin, he was in a Bible school a couple blocks from the University of Oregon when I was in graduate school there. And he studied his way out of fundamentalism and found his way to that same viewpoint by studying Whitehead.

And just to be completely clear, when somebody asked you this, you said, "My view is closest to process theology." It wasn't process theology per se, correct?

No, I could call it Blakeian consciousness easily.

Isn't that similar in outlook to phenomenology? Basically that life is a consciousness with interaction with the world around it?

Yeah, and it depends on your definition of phenomenology. Husserl himself sketched it out as something that sounded just right to be aware of your awareness and essentially to feel yourself as a process within processes.

But then Husserl, for some reason, tried to reduce it to platonic reductionism. Very weird.

He became idealistic. Have you noticed that when your metabolism is at its best, you basically tend to, I don't know if it happens to you, but it happens to be, you tend to suspend judgment in regards to the events that you experience?

Yeah, because your thoughts are best when they extend and incorporate a large span of time. Only by suspending judgment can you fill up your consciousness with what it takes to support that perception and understand it.

Love that. Okay, this next question is from Phil Greaves. He says, "What does Ray think of Marx's scientific method and social revolution?"

Several Christians and capitalists have said Marx's science was very useful. For example, Nelson Rockefeller said he understood Marx as well as the leftist reporters he was talking to, but he used Marx's ideas to increase his power and wealth.

That's the nature of a science. Anyone can use it to do what they want to for good or bad purposes.

But where Marx got his ethical orientation was right out of Christianity. Christian communism and Christian socialism had been going on almost 2,000 years when Marx created a scientific understanding of why society is built the way it is.

But the way you use that scientific understanding, Rockefeller knew it could be good for him to understand society that way.

The thing I feel like we will get comments down below. I feel like people are going to say all this stuff is because of Marx. So what would you say to that?

All this stuff is what?

All this COVID stuff, like making people…

The BLM, Black Lives Matter, the riots, everything is driven by Marxist ideology.

Everything is Marxism and they're imposing it on us. What would your response be to that?

I don't see any connection at all. You could say it's the Rockefeller world controlling class, the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and World Economic Forum.

They might understand Marx and use Marx, but Marx had the ethics that you should not kill off billions of people.

Great stuff. And then have you ever heard that the Club of Rome, like the World Economic Forum is like an extension of Club of Rome? Have you ever heard that before?

Extension of what?

A Club of Rome, those people that…

Oh, Club of Rome. I think the same people were involved, definitely the same class purposes.

Yeah, nice. I thought that made the old elite history and the new stuff make a little bit more sense when somebody suggested that.

Thanks for that, Ray. Okay, so, and I won't keep you longer. We'll go another 25 minutes or so.

And I sincerely appreciate it, Ray, coming on here. It's always really special when you do that.

And Georgi Dinkov, my partner in crime, thank you so much. And thank you everybody for listening.

These are always so fun to do and we have such an amazing audience and you guys all make that possible.

So sincere appreciation on my part.

Okay, so this next question is from Michael and he says, "How much," he has a bunch of questions, but I picked the, "How much does intuitive thinking coincide with intellectual processing and why does intuition at times seemingly lead us to poor choices?"

Well, analysis and reasoning can lead to horrible outcomes. Intuition, the way it's different from simple reasoning, is that instead of starting with postulates and leading to logical conclusions, you're always open.

When you change your postulates, you have a flexible, open view of the world. That's an extreme, that's the process view of the world where you don't, you aren't committed to a formal, defined set of logical statements.

And you're constantly refining your hypothesis about the world. So it's open to change or the rational approach to the world.

You have to get someone to write new algorithms for you and the organism is absolutely not a bunch of algorithms. It's a process that is constantly revising itself.

Do you think one of the reasons for intuition leading sometimes to bad outcomes is because some people live in a world that's been deliberately engineered to disfavor such approach to life?

Yeah, it's trying to implant its doctrines and ways of reasoning.

And Ray, you maintain that, I don't know how to say this, but a pure type of intuition, an animal intuition, is altruistic in nature?

Yeah, that's one of the properties of either liberation theology or process theology or Marx's approach to understanding Marxism.

It's that you have to recognize that there is a reality to good and justice and evil and injustice. The nature of the world is that we are able to appreciate those differences.

Where the artificial intelligence type of rationalism makes no difference between good and bad, better and worse.

And not to beat a dead horse here, but that natural altruism or good nature, can that be overridden by lack of basic needs, do you think?

Yeah, by injuring the person or the animal.

Yeah, you've seen that study with the locust and the grasshopper, right? Where basically they simply injecting a grasshopper with a little bit of serotonin turns them, you know, they're usually they're gregarious, they're playful, they're curious, they're altruistic.

You inject a little bit of serotonin and then turn into cannibalistic homicidal beasts that devour everything on their path, including each other.

Thanks for that, you two. Appreciate it. Okay, I skipped over this one accidentally. This Macaroni Delta says, "Is the desire for revenge always serotonergic or can it have a place in a healthy person's psychology?"

Yeah, I think if you've been slightly injured, you have to process the damage that has been done. And at least mentally, you can think of getting revenge as restoring your wholeness.

It's a mental process of understanding why a person would injure you and incorporating that. You can have thoughts of revenge as part of the process of how to interpret that and go on without actually having to do destructive retaliatory things.

There was a study with prisoners of war in Vietnam and they found out that the ones who psychiatrically/psychologically did the best were the ones who fantasized about either escape or getting back at their captors but without acting upon it because the ones that did act upon it either got killed or for some reason, even when they were liberated or managed to escape, they did not do well health-wise.

They ended up with a post-traumatic stress disorder or something else, but the ones that didn't revenge but had vivid imagery of how they're going to pay back to their captors or escape, they seemed to do okay.

Yeah, that kind of mental imagery is part of a healing process, I think, activating your creative ability in a bad situation. It can involve some bad images, but when you do it, you can reconstruct yourself as a constructive, ongoing person with responsibility for improving things.

And it tends to happen when the person is isolated, right? Because normally they will talk to other people and process their trauma through others. But if you're in a prisoner camp, you don't have much opportunity to do that, so you're essentially replacing that with these vivid mental images.

This actually ties in with the process theology, right? Because in your Blake newsletter, you say the desire for vengeance comes with a delusive commitment to the world of memory. Virginity is constantly renewed in the world of the imaginative life.

While Blake said that you can't forgive someone until they stop hurting you, the desire to be forgiven indicates that there's an opportunity to resolve the problem.

Also, I think I detected what you said, if you understand the pathological nature of the person that's hurting you, does that alleviate the frustration of "why are they doing this?"

Yeah. Once, a cop was extremely unjust, and I thought intensely about that, and what a miserable person he was. But then, in the process of mulling it over for a few hours, I was able to put him in the context and see him as a victim who suffered.

Suffered from various pressures that caused him to become such a miserable thing.

Didn't Mark say that even if you take a serial killer and then you start digging through their life, especially as a child, you'll quickly go from very mad to very sad in regards to their persona?

So instead of hating them, you'll be like, "Wow, it makes total sense that a person would act that way."

Yeah, there are cases where a very bad cop or criminal has got out of that situation and sought forgiveness and realized what he had been doing and changed.

So that's a very Christian ethic, right? As long as you're willing to ask for forgiveness and willing to work to improve your life, then God will grant you forgiveness.

Yeah, and it's basically a good biological reflex. Healthy biology.

Would you agree with Alice Miller when she says, "Contempt is the weapon of the weak, and defense against one's own despised and unwanted feelings?"

Sounds right.

Yeah? And I think you replied to somebody about the development of these types of authoritarian automatons, and you suggested reading Alice Miller and Wilhelm Reich on how those people develop.

Great stuff. Go ahead.

No.

I have a related question. The theme of love is a very central theme in Christianity and many religions, if not all of them.

And many people intuitively feel that being in a relationship, in an intensely loving relationship on both sides, is extremely therapeutic and gives tremendous meaning to life.

What is the physiological underpinning to that, do you think?

Well, it was already incorporated at the time of Christianity. A few chapters in the Bible talk about that.

Reich, in his book "The Murder of Christ," quotes a lot from the Bible and creates a very different orientation from what you hear in a lot of sermons, a very biological, very Christian and ethical approach toward the world.

Right, but when somebody is in love or feels loved and accepted, do you think that the underlying mechanism is basically you're completely stress-free because the world, through this other human being, accepts you for who you are?

You don't need to pretend and do crazy things in order to be accepted.

Yeah, the primitive Christianity was historically, for a couple hundred years, that seemed to be the central theme. Love thy neighbor in a practical way.

Great stuff. You know, we won't go too much longer here. I'll let you go very soon, Reich. I sincerely appreciate it.

This one's from Mac, and they say, "Hi, Danny. I would love to hear more about how the mind affects biological processes, processes, however you say that, along the lines of mind and tissue.

I know you have spoken before about how a stimulating life encourages positive biological processes/processes, however you say that."

You know what I think they're talking about is when you said in "Mind and Tissue," when you go outside to an interesting place and the brain starts consuming tons of glucose and it's very stimulating? That's what reminded me of when I read this.

The way we think about the body and its organs, we've been indoctrinated to think in terms of substance and energy as different things.

Energy is what pushes matter around in space, but it isn't a factual description of matter and energy.

The body we experience is a unitary process, so the organs and tissues and cells and conscious experience are really all one substantial phenomenon.

Great stuff.

One substance in which energy is moving you as a whole. You don't have to think about the way your life is specifically working on cells and organs.

Great stuff.

I have a question about routine versus interest in life.

If you're doing something repetitive, wouldn't that give a signal to the cells in the brain that they don't need to produce as much energy through oxidative phosphorylation because it's the same thing every single time?

Eventually, they're kind of like traveling down their oxidative phosphorylation and may get rid of it altogether if all you're doing is the same thing over and over again.

Yeah.

You can't really do anything twice.

Like Heraclitus said, you're always changing.

If you're trapped in that kind of repetitive behavior, you either have to escape or go to sleep.

People tend to put themselves to sleep rather than escaping from pointless work.

Are you saying that the tendency to doze off and fall asleep when you're doing something boring, that's a normal physiological reaction to escape the energetic stress that this activity is causing?

I think so.

Okay. That's very interesting.

Would it be therapeutic if somebody's stuck at a job?

I know the best thing is to leave, right?

But if somebody's stuck at a job that they consider repetitive or routine or generally unfulfilling, would it be therapeutic to remind ourselves of what Heraclitus said?

You may think you're doing the exact same thing, but it's really not.

Every moment of your life is different from one second to the other.

Yeah. That's the process that should be happening.

I have to say, when I worked at Apple Retail, every moment seemed exactly the same, unfortunately, Georgie.

I don't know about that.

Okay. Awesome.

Two more here, and then we'll let you—I think Georgie has a question as well, and then we'll let you go here.

Okay, this one's about a tortured dog.

They say, "My dog was brutally tortured before I adopted him." S-R-A, I think it's satanic ritualistic abuse, I believe.

"How can I help him reset this trauma and live a normal life? After two years, he is still unable to relax or play."

I think lots of personal interaction, perceiving what he's experiencing, and giving him rubdowns and body pleasure, good massages,

rubbing his head and neck and ears a lot while paying close attention, trying to draw out little bits of pleasure that are there.

Amazing. Okay, we'll end with this last one. I don't know if you even understand this one.

He says, "What are Ray's thoughts on planes of existence beyond our physical world, such as the etheric and astral planes?

And if possible, how would your definition of energy coincide with this cosmological view?

If pure energy is the primordial essence of creation, is it confined solely to the physical world, or does it emerge elsewhere?"

I don't think there is any elsewhere. And part of those categories derive from thinking about matter as inert substance.

If you have a very metaphysical idea about what matter is, then you have to have an idea of what animates matter,

and so you get involved in separate energy and planes and so on. But there are all different levels of subtle interactions.

It isn't just the powerful energy that runs through us metabolically to maintain our structure,

but given that complex structure, our sensitivities increase in proportion to how well-structured we are.

And insects and probably dogs, for example, can detect at a distance a single vibrating molecule.

For example, a pheromone molecule can be at a distance and very spread out, but the infrared oscillations emitted by the molecule just sitting there

are strong enough to be sensed by insects. So the environment is constantly offering us information about itself,

and those levels of subtle energy interactions depend on our sensitivity to them.

And by tuning in, you can find out that our world is full of lots of information and messages that are ignored if you believe in inert matter and separate energy and so on.

Doesn't the idea of having a reality beyond this one ultimately lead to either one of these two paradoxes?

Either what the Church calls "creatio ex nihilo," which is something was created out of nothing, which to me is absurd,

or an infinite regression, which they call "reductio ad absurdum."

So as soon as you start talking about a world beyond this world, ultimately you'll end up in one of those two, with one of those two explanations.

And both of them are, to me, sound absurd, sound senseless.

Yeah, I think that line of reasoning is because we have been taught a certain doctrine about reasoning,

of Rene Descartes' idea of inert matter and consciousness, activating it and so on,

putting dualism or worse into the very definitions that you're working with.

You have to start looking at language as something that you can work with.

You don't have to accept what people tell you. It is built into reality of language.

So if we had higher rates of metabolism and we paid attention more, we could talk to Aphrodite the cat like you did?

I think everyone is open to that sort of communication.

It's just that the animals are always willing, but people live in their dream world of word consciousness.

Why do you think the second signal system evolved, Ray? I mean, it seems to be a largely pathological development in evolution.

I think it has practicality to make remote things something you can talk about,

rather than having to stay with the surrounding immediate reality that animals and people can talk about.

And maybe potentially pass down through the generations, like abstract information?

Yeah, remote in time or space.

Okay. But invariably, if it gets pushed to the extreme, it becomes quickly pathological, right?

Too much analytical thought, too much deductionism.

Very easily pathological.

Inferring people from about the age of five or six on participates in flowing mental perceptions.

Is there an easy or at least quick way to gauge in a particular society or country,

like how much of each system is at play on average in their population?

I mean, some countries have the stereotype of being extremely logical and analytical,

and others being primitive brutes, which to me is a euphemism for they're probably first signal people.

Yeah, I tried to do that when I was studying linguistics 60 years ago.

I tried to identify those traits of national identity and language differences.

So is it something that can be gleaned through from the language that a specific country or group of people uses?

I think so. I think the countries that have lost their grammar to some extent

have opened up their ability to receive messages in a more realistic and biological way.

So you're saying cultures with fewer grammatical rules in their language tend to be more open-minded?

I think so. That was what I was starting my linguistics thesis on.

In the economics world, they're saying that you can measure a country's freedom by the sheer number of laws it has on the books.

Do you think that's a good surrogate too? Basically, the more laws, the less free a country is?

Yeah, that's a reflection of how many laws are built into your language.

You don't have to have a written language, but that helps to turn it into a distracting country.

If you have a language that is more fluid, flexible, that lets you have better perceptions.

I'm going to close the show, Georgie. Do you have one more question?

No, I'm fine.

raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com is available by email now. It's $28 US, which can be paid through PayPal at raypeats@gmail.com.

You can email the same newsletter to buy all of Ray's books in digital copy.

Can they get those in print as well?

Some of them are still in print.

Amazing. Progeste from Keenogen emailed Catherine. She just shipped me 12 bottles. She packages it extremely nicely.

Ray, is that film over the progesterone to protect it during the shipping process?

Yeah, to keep out maybe even x-rays to some extent.

That's what I figured. That's amazing that she does that.

Each bottle of Progeste contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

Ray, thank you so much. Stay on the line. We'll chat. We'll let you go. Thank you again.

We have an amazing listenership. Sincerely appreciate these things. These things are so fun to do.

Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much for being my partner in crime.

And again, thank you, Ray, for all your work and everything you do. Sincerely appreciate it.

Have a safe weekend.

We'll talk to you guys soon.

OK, peace out, bye.

Okay. Peace out. Bye.[long pause]

- Okay, hello everybody.

Welcome to the show.

I just interrupted Ray

and he was talking about the CIA and art.

Ray, go ahead and reiterate or say whatever you were

gonna say before I interrupted you.

- Oh, just that the traditions in painting

had accumulated lots of knowledge

from the time of Michelangelo

and the older, older so-called classical paintings.

They had been learning actual physical principles

about light and geometry and teaching their art students

sort of an aspect of physics

to use in representing the world.

And then the first world war,

the Dada surrealist reaction and Freudianism

rejected the whole so-called rational system

that created such terrible things as the world war.

And that went with a lot of experimentation

in both the arts and sciences and humanities

trying out different things

and Hitler closed all of the experimental art schools

and descending science programs and such.

But right during and after the second world war,

the CIA created the thing they called

Congress for Cultural Freedom

in which they imposed that revolutionary

attitude towards painting,

destroying the old because of its connection

to the corrupt system.

But they put it out as the glory of Western culture,

of freedom and Siqueiros,

the Mexican painter called it ghost art

imposed by the Rockefellers to destroy consciousness,

abstract expressionism, for example,

all of the abstract approaches to art

and the activities of the CIA

through the Cultural Freedom Foundation

shamed and expelled from the universities

the traditional people who preserved

the great tradition in painting

so that a whole generation of painters

in the universities didn't learn how to paint at all.

We're just now beginning to come out of that phase

where the whole culture was deliberately being destroyed

and rerouted down the Rockefeller ghost art route

to destroy actual understanding.

I see Noam Chomsky's linguistics

so-called as being one of the most powerful

examples of that.

Real linguistics had developed

with Franz Boas and his students

and they had created descriptions

understanding of a great variety of language and culture

that sort of a peak idea was the Horafian hypothesis

showing the absolute interaction

between conceptual understanding of the world

and how the language is structured.

And that was a way of understanding

the role of language behind science and art and culture,

the way that language can propagandistically

destroy understanding of reality.

That was part of the real tradition of linguistics.

At MIT with Pentagon funding,

the trend under Noam Chomsky

was to throw out everything that was real

in the linguistics tradition

and substitute mysticism based views

of consciousness in which words

are essentially determined by genes.

It's a long story that many historians of language

have looked back on it and pointed out

that his so-called generative linguistics,

generative grammar couldn't generate anything

and wasn't a grammar.

It was a total fraud, but school textbooks,

high school books incorporated his ideas

and supposedly since it described language production

in terms of a language apparatus

which is genetically determined,

supposedly learning his so-called linguistics

would make it easier to understand the English language

or whatever language you're studying.

And they actually sold those books

to school boards across the country.

Absolutely destructive, not only useless,

but destroying a consciousness of how language really works.

So when he got famous for his anti-imperialism,

the world just sort of politely forgot

how fraudulent his linguistics work had been.

Do you think that he--

Fraudulent in the direction of opening

the philosophical world to accept whatever

the Pentagon and CIA wanted to substitute for consciousness.

Do you suspect he was working under the direction

of anybody specific?

No, I think he was one of the originators

having grown up studying mysticism,

it blended right into, I think he believed

in that mystical idea that there is no consciousness

other than words, which in a fairly recent video

he was explaining that dogs can't think,

animals can't think because they don't have words.

But he said, I forget, canine or dog, he spelled out,

he said if they heard me say dogs,

they would get excited and think we were going somewhere.

So he was saying dogs don't have consciousness

because they don't have words, but then he had to spell out

the word because he didn't want to get the dogs excited.

Are you going to say something, Georgie?

Oh, Georgie, your audio.

I think you're muted, Georgie.

Sorry, can you hear me now?

Yeah, now you're good.

Yeah, so weren't the experiments in North Carolina

with deaf and mute people that the state thought

they were, I guess using Chomsky's theory,

they thought that these were complete cretins

that had like no consciousness, no feelings, no mind,

and they actually forcibly sterilized them.

And then later on, somebody did IQ tests on those people

and turned out that they're perfectly intelligent.

So doesn't that invalidate Chomsky's theory directly?

How is history connected because of their speech?

Yeah, exactly. So these people had no language, right?

They were born deaf and mute and all they could do basically

is like, I mean, they had sign language,

which eventually they learned, but initially

they had no language and all they had is perception

and visual perception and tactile perception.

And when a psychiatrist did IQ tests on them,

turned out that some of them were like slightly behind,

but most of them had normal intelligence.

So it's difficult to argue that Chomsky was right

because this directly proves even in humans,

people with no language are perfectly capable

of conscious experience.

Yeah, everything in reality falsifies Chomsky.

Why is this guy still a tenured professor at MIT then?

Is it just inertia?

Well, at the same time, he was creating his anti-linguistics,

anti-science doctrine of generative grammar.

One of his students said that even though the press

all through the US was saying Chomsky has explained

how the brain creates language,

he in person said when he says generate,

he means it in a mathematical sense of account for.

He was knowing that people were being misled,

that he was aware that it wouldn't actually generate anything

that was useless for that purpose.

But at the same time he was doing that,

Norbert Wiener with his more holistic approach

to cybernetics, non-digital, analog approach,

he was present at MIT, but because he criticized war,

wouldn't take money from the Pentagon, he was ostracized.

Chomsky was glad to receive funding from the Pentagon.

He was a supporter of a Pentagon rocket man

to be the chancellor of MIT, very close to the Pentagon,

powered and taking their money,

and being in a way the Pentagon's pet anti-imperialist.

Chomsky used to be a close associate,

if not even a friend of Marvin Minsky,

one of the creators of the AI movement.

And I think where Minsky greatly disagreed

with Chomsky's theory that language is genetically determined

because Minsky said, listen, if that's the case,

we should have been able by now to create an algorithm

that would allow a computer to generate and learn a language de novo.

And we miserably failed every time we tried.

- Yeah, that's what Chomsky led the public to believe he had.

But a couple of times when I was teaching linguistics,

nationally known linguists would go around basically propagandizing.

And when they would come to my class to talk,

I would have a chance to explain what was wrong with Chomsky's thing.

I pointed out that you can create a sentence

if you pick out the right system, right series of his rules,

you can create a sentence in any language in the world.

But only if you know what the sentence is you want to produce

to know what series to choose your rules in.

You can't make a sentence that you don't know already applying his rules.

The choice of the rules has to be guided by the finished sentence.

And a couple of them actually understood the concept.

You can see that they only took them a couple of minutes to forget it.

- In one of your articles you said that the real structure of language is images based on images.

So if I understand this correctly, language comes after perception,

just like anything else in this world.

So if language is based on images,

is the fundamental structure of language based in physical brain structure,

which always changes with time and experience?

- Yeah, the brain structure as formed by interaction with the world.

- So in other words, metabolic rate, which greatly influences changes in brain structure,

it may be the ultimate determinant in the evolution of language.

- Yeah, you can analyze language.

Someone looked at letters that nuns had written in their 20s,

and then they knew the outcome.

And those who developed Alzheimer's at a relatively young age,

they could see that their language structure in their 20s was simplified.

And at a young age with a lot of mental energy,

the language structure is extremely complex and unique.

Every situation demands a fundamental rethinking of the whole thing.

And so there is real uniqueness in everything a healthy person says.

And when the mental energy is lower, what you get is strings of cliches.

- So basically the ability to turn experiences into language depends on the metabolic rate vitally.

- Yeah.

- And the summation of that is Chomsky was too addicted to the MIT Epstein money to change his ways.

- To change his what?

- Change his ways, change his theories. He was too committed to them.

I'm just joking.

Didn't Epstein work at MIT?

- Oh, not that I've heard of.

Oh, yeah, just a little while before he was notorious,

he was funding one of their programs,

and the guy who accepted his funding was embarrassed and quit.

- I think him and Minsky collaborated on a few things,

or at least Epstein sponsored some of Minsky's research.

At least that's what I saw recently on the global research site

and some of the other more peripheral ones which seem to be speaking more truth

than mainstream media has cumulatively done over the century.

- Well, speaking of that, so obviously we'll talk about all those things,

but first I wanted to chat about Ray's newsletter,

and then we could kind of go off the deep end on all the coronavirus stuff.

And so, Ray, you just sent out your Ray Peat's newsletter,

Estrogen, Iron, Degenerative Aging, and Progesterone.

And again, it's insane to me that you're--

Go ahead.

I was going to say, I thought you were putting together new parts of the puzzle,

and I thought it was just amazing that you're still synthesizing these new ideas

every two months, you know, so I thought it was a fantastic newsletter.

What was your motivation behind writing it?

- Just noticing that people weren't putting two and two together over the years.

Stuff that people could have been actually doing serious work on 50 years ago.

No one really has the motivation or energy to draw the conclusions.

- And I thought--

- Incidentally, some people probably still don't have their copy of it

because Gmail is limiting it to a certain number every 24 hours.

And so I think about half of them still haven't gone through.

- Bummer. If you need any help with that, let us know, obviously.

But what were some of the major points?

You're obviously conversing with the public all the time.

What are the huge misconceptions that you feel like this newsletter covered

that are just repeated over and over that you think are incorrect?

- That working on one part of it, like taking an aromatase inhibitor,

isn't going to solve very much.

At the same time, improving one thing is likely to be making something else worse.

And so to look at the whole process as far as you can

and think of how you can remedy things with the least risk of doing more damage.

- I have a question on one of the main themes that you have there,

which says that osteoporosis and dementia are associated with iron overload,

but they're also associated with an increased likelihood of anemia.

So what would be your understanding of anemia?

Just low ferritin and low iron saturation?

- No anemia, low blood, low hematopoietin, low hemoglobin.

And about 50 years ago, someone was studying the health of California migrant workers

and found that the kids running around somewhat hungry and dirty

were healthier than the local middle class Anglo kids.

And one of their features, the immigrant, very poor kids,

had I think a hemoglobin of 10 or 10.5, something like that.

And it isn't just malaria in Africa that flares up and kills people

when they give them an iron supplement,

but right in the U.S. they can see that so-called anemic kids are healthier

than the ones with the so-called normal levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin.

- So by iron overload, you mean the accumulation of unusable iron

in the forms of lipofuscin and other iron complexes?

- Yeah, and estrogen is one of the things that causes you to retain iron,

but protectively lowers your hemoglobin and hematocrit.

And for 100 years, doctors have looked at the women

sometimes with very low hematocrit or hemoglobin and prescribed iron pills

and kept prescribing it even if their hemoglobin got lower,

not understanding that the same thing that makes them overload on iron

is blocking their bone marrow formation of red blood cells.

- So the well-known effects of increasing hematocrit and hemoglobin

under the effect of androgens, is that due to the opposition of androgens

to estrogen or a direct effect of androgens?

- Both direct on the bone marrow in particular,

androgen stabilizes it and helps it get warmer,

more productive, estrogen tends to lower the temperature,

and that goes, among other things, with a tendency to inflammation and iron toxicity.

- Have you seen those studies that claim that the purpose, apparently,

of fever is to deplete serum iron and tryptophan,

which helps greatly in fighting off an infection?

- Yeah, and it reduces all sorts of cytokines,

chilling creates inflammation, secreting inflammatory cytokines,

and causes cells to take up water,

and the falling temperature is not only a sign of,

but it's one of the mechanisms by which estrogen changes the body physiology.

- Can you run through the calcium metabolism and how that leads to the accumulation of iron?

What does parathyroid hormone have to do with iron overload?

- The way parathyroid works, for example,

under stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,

that system activates the parathyroid hormone.

Serotonin, pro-inflammatory, activates the parathyroid to provide more calcium

to the bloodstream by taking it out of the bone.

And the way it takes it out of the bone is to suppress the formation of carbon dioxide

because carbon dioxide helps the present calcium to crystallize into the bone

as calcium carbonate.

And when the CO2 production is lowered,

it's replaced by glycolytic production of lactic acid,

and the lactic acid in itself helps to dissolve the bone.

pH isn't the thing because you can have low pH with CO2 forming bone

and the same pH with lactic acid disassembling the bone.

And in all the rest of your tissues, including the cells in your bone,

making the lactic acid,

all of the intracellular processes, blood vessels in particular, suffer.

When they shift from producing carbon dioxide to producing lactate,

the intracellular pH rises,

increasing the negative ionization of the cell proteins,

increasing their affinity for metals with a positive charge.

Ionized calcium with two positive charges, iron, aluminum, lead,

any other metal that is present will be stuck inside your soft tissue cells

along with the calcium,

especially if the calcium is deficient in your diet.

You will be taking up more iron, aluminum, lead,

whatever is present in your intestine.

So the more calcium deficient you are, the more parathyroid hormone you make,

and the more other metals will be present under the influence of parathyroid hormone

to crystallize, poisoning your blood vessels and brain cells and kidney cells in particular.

In Gilbert Ling's theory, potassium, which is another alkali mineral,

has the highest affinity for the intracellular proteins.

How are these other metals, such as sodium, calcium, and iron,

able to displace potassium and disrupt the structure that potassium forms in the proteins?

The carbon dioxide causes its affinity for electrons as an acidic Lewis acid molecule,

and as it associates with the proteins, the electrons are retracted,

making the electron cloud holding the potassium proton,

holding the potassium alternatively with protons,

making it experience a lower attractive concentration of electrons.

And since the water polarization of the big potassium atom

doesn't interfere with that lower electronic attractive field,

the potassium is strongly attracted even to an electron retracted protein.

But as the carbon dioxide is decreased and the pH rises under the influence of forming lactic acid,

then the electron cloud on the protein is no longer retracted towards the CO2,

but it forms a more intense concentration of negative charge,

which will overcome the highly polarized water layers around sodium, for example,

but also around other highly concentrated positive charges.

So once the sodium starts displacing the potassium,

then the calcium and lead, mercury and iron will have a chance to get in at the same time as the calcium.

So you're saying that during the elevation of lactic acid production, intracellular pH rises,

but that's because the cell quickly expels the lactic acid it produces, right?

That's what's raising the pH, because if the lactic acid stays inside,

the pH will drop and the cell will probably die.

Yeah, but the lactic acid quickly moves out of the cell and acidifies the environment,

creating other problems, activating inflammatory signals and so on.

But what happens inside when the lactic acid leaves is an increased pH

because of the way the NADH handles its protons.

Does lactic acid increase the reactivity of iron?

I don't recall how they interact directly.

Okay, so iron basically, by being in the body, if there are a lot of reactive oxygen species,

they're the ones that turn iron into the reactive form, which is the ferrous iron,

and that's what attacks the polyunsaturated fats?

Mm-hmm. The CO2 is known to have an inactivating effect on iron,

helping to keep it in a relatively oxidized state because of that acid property of CO2.

And just by displacing CO2, then lactic acid is, in effect, likely to make iron more reactive.

When you reduce the triply ionized ferric iron, you get the highly reactive ferrous iron.

So the reducing property of lactic acid is for sure going to create iron damage.

And in that case, the reactive oxygen species are also a problem

because they also have this reductive effect, right?

I mean, so keeping the metabolic rate high and preventing the leakage of these reactive oxygen species

through the membrane, keeping their numbers low, is another thing that will limit the activation of iron

and turning it into the reactive form.

Yeah, it's a whole flowing system that changes the nature of the cytoplasmic substance.

It's a process that isn't just an adding of a lot of little events,

but the whole—the way Gilbert Ling saw it was that the nature of the substance of the cell

has these different ways of existing.

What is the direct conductor of this whole process?

I mean, in some articles you mentioned thyroid and other CO2,

but I guess the main effector of these beneficial changes, which keep the intracellular pH low,

keep the iron from getting into the reactive state, keep the electron flow going,

it seems that all of this, the direct agent is carbon dioxide,

but the thyroid is just the cause of the creation of carbon dioxide.

Yeah, this CO2 is the most pervasive and powerful and immediate causer.

And it simultaneously goes with your consciousness, your level of motivation and sensitivity

and all of those things, all of the life properties correspond to basically the level of CO2 in your tissue.

In your estimation, is parathyroid hormone one of the strongest stimulators of lactic acid production?

Yeah, as I presently understand it.

So all things being equal, if you were to be injected with estrogen or serotonin or PTH,

PTH would be the worst out of all of those?

Yeah, except that estrogen ends up increasing your PTH.

Well, I was talking to Kate Deering, we were trading emails back and forth,

and we were trying to figure something out, and I realized I had like a

estrogen increases parathyroid hormone, prolactin increases parathyroid hormone,

aldosterone, like every single thing, serotonin increases parathyroid,

so it seemed like that was, I don't know, the final common path of stress.

Is that how you look at it?

Yeah, the angiotensin system is very close to it, but I think that's the right way of seeing it.

But the reverse is also true, isn't it?

Parathyroid hormone stimulates the production of all of these other mitigators as well.

Yeah, because it creates the degenerative alarm condition,

and the short-term recuperative stress hormones all exacerbate the long-range degenerative processes.

And last question about this, I'm pretty, I don't know if I caught this ever,

the parathyroid hormone is stimulating the production of lactic acid from the bone specifically, is that right?

Well, that's its functional, most known action, but it can't help doing it everywhere in the body.

And then to do that to other tissues, it just has to be in the blood, is that right?

Yeah.

Awesome.

What increases cellular uptake of parathyroid hormone, and what, conversely, what inhibits it?

Is there a mechanism that can do one or the other?

One or the other, what?

Cellular uptake of parathyroid hormone.

In other words, is there a way to make the cell more resistant to parathyroid hormone?

Like, I mean, I know the medicine talks about receptors, but as you said, the cell is the entire receptor,

the entire cell is the receptor.

What makes the cell resistant to parathyroid hormone?

Nothing that I know of.

Wow.

So really the only way to protect is limit its synthesis.

Yeah, and vitamin D and calcium and magnesium are the things that are best known to do that.

But at the same time, reducing androtensin and serotonin and aldosterone, for example.

Is there a specific parathyroid hormone receptor that medicine claims is the main mechanism through which that hormone works?

I'm not familiar with it.

Okay. Maybe that's why, like, there may be steroids that compete with it, but I guess the receptor hasn't been found yet,

or at least medicine is not interested in looking at it because they think parathyroid hormone is the greatest thing since sliced bread.

It's given to osteoporotic people to increase their bone growth.

Yeah.

Ray, I forgot what article you had posted this in,

but apparently parathyroid hormone is harder to suppress as you get older or sicker,

and it was a DAMI paper, A-D-A-M-I, relationship between serum parathyroid hormone, vitamin D sufficiency, age, and calcium intake.

I think it does increase with age.

One of the interesting things that they don't like to talk about either is that the bone with aging and osteoporosis forms lots of aromatase.

It becomes a powerful source of estrogen at the same time that it's degenerating.

And that would be ameliorated by what? Just decreasing the activity of the parathyroid?

Or no, this is a functional aspect of the bone that's not going to change?

Or how do you reverse that?

Yeah. Getting your calcium and vitamin D and magnesium high enough that you turn off your parathyroid hormone,

that's necessarily going to reduce the local stress and all of the signals that increase aromatase.

Amazing. Might take a five-minute break here. We have Ray Peat on the phone.

Georgie Dinkov, my partner in crime.

We're talking about Ray Peat's newsletter right now. The newsletter is available by email now.

It's $28 US, which can be paid through PayPal.

Ray Peat's newsletter, Peats@gmail.com. Ray is sending those out right now.

You can also email Ray Peat's newsletter to purchase Ray's books.

I frequently come in contact with people that have no idea that you've written any books.

I would strongly recommend people get a hold of these. They're basically collector's items.

Ray, why don't we talk about Progest-E from Ketogen and how does progesterone relate to parathyroid hormone?

It strengthens your bones and turns off aromatase.

Once you recognize that stressed bones produce estrogen by their local aromatase,

then you see one of the reasons that progesterone is going to strengthen the bones because it knocks out,

it inhibits aromatase and knocks out the estrogen receptors.

In addition to good nutrition and calcium and vitamin D, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin K would be good things for osteoporosis?

Yeah, everything good helps your bones.

I have a question. In one of your newsletters, you said that serotonin antagonists are highly anabolic for the bone.

I've seen a number of different studies come out with the various drugs, one of them ondansetron,

which is prescribed for nausea but it's really a serotonin antagonist.

It seems that these agents somehow directly work on the osteoclasts and osteoblasts without necessarily affecting parathyroid hormones.

It seems like serotonin has a direct effect on bone health that is, while overlapping with parathyroid hormone,

there's an independent component of it too. Would you agree?

Yeah, I think everything really is overlapping.

The receptor idea is just a way of trying to introduce order kind of artificially.

Amazing. Thanks for that. Email Catherine to purchase Progest-E.

Each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone. It lasts a very long time, unless you use it topically,

which I'm going through bottles every month.

Another question on progesterone. In one of your articles, you mentioned that high enough concentrations of progesterone

can actually make the so-called estrogen receptor protein completely disintegrate.

I've seen many studies confirming that and other substances, such as caffeine, apparently have the same effect.

Does progesterone have the same sort of disintegrating effect on aromatase too, or is it simply inhibiting its effects?

I think it's just blocking the promotion.

For example, one of the powerful promoters of aromatase is prostaglandin, E.

The enzyme cyclooxygenase that makes prostaglandin is activated under almost exactly the same circumstances that activate aromatase.

So there's almost always prostaglandin, E, present, pushing for the formation of estrogen.

Progesterone is known to, in multiple overlapping ways, to block the formation of prostaglandin, E, by creating destructive metabolites of it,

blocking its formation and probably several parallel mechanisms that prevent the activation, opposing cortisol's activating effect on aromatase.

What do you think is the main mechanism behind the synthesis of the actual aromatase protein?

Is it simply under the body detects the metabolic rate is low or there are tissue and organ needs, you know, massive amounts of repair,

and that's what triggers genomically the synthesis of more aromatase?

Or is there another mechanism behind it, like radiation, heavy metals, things like that?

Yeah, all of those things overlap for more than 50 years. Radiation, hypoxia, vitamin E deficiency, progesterone deficiency,

all of these have been known to activate the formation of more aromatase.

You have to then look at what each one of these things is doing. Each one of those factors, radiation, hypoxia, and so on,

is also activating many other parts of the cell, which lead to activation of aromatase. So it's like a holistic switch mechanism

in which everything gathers up a summation of forces to either turn aromatase on or off.

Does the entry of steroids into the cell depend on the steroid structure and the status, the lipophilic or hydrophilic status of the cell?

For example, cortisol and estrogen are much more hydrophilic than things like pregnenolone or progesterone.

So if the cell is composed of fully saturated fats and is highly lipophilic,

would that decrease the amount of hydrophilic steroids such as glucocorticoids and estrogen and aldosterone from entering inside the cell?

Yeah, because at the same time it's keeping the energy state of the cell up, which maintains the hydrophobic condition.

The stabilizing of the hydrophobicity is also the stabilizing of the energy level, and that suppresses all of the things that would call for raising the amount of estrogen or cortisol in the blood.

So a very well energized, highly lipophilic cell would be resistant to estrogen even though it may be expressing the estrogen receptor at a normal level.

So it may look like an estrogen sensitive cell, but estrogen can't really do much because it cannot get inside.

Yeah, and it's probably keeping the estrogen receptors on the verge of disintegration to keep the hydrophobicity high.

Do you think that may account for some studies that show that if you drastically increase the intake of saturated fat in the diet,

it shows an increase of the amount of estradiol in the urine and sometimes in the blood as well?

Would that be simply because the body is excreting all of this estradiol that cannot be used because the cells simply are impervious to it?

I think so. A group, I think, generally led by Pasqualini has identified the processes of increasing estrogen in the cell or decreasing it.

And in about 10 different ways, progesterone's effect is to get estrogen out of the cell and inactivated,

made water soluble so that it travels through the blood quickly and is excreted.

So the deficiency of progesterone will leave your cells highly activated by estrogen.

For example, in the uterus or breast tissue that is deficient in progesterone, it's internally, it begins making its own estrogen

but doesn't depend on the ovaries or adrenals to, you know, they used to cut those out to prevent or cure breast cancer.

But if you take out the ovaries and adrenals, you're also taking out progesterone

and that activates the process of forming estrogen locally, starting with the uterus and breast, but eventually going to every tissue that has been studied.

Since the main method of deactivating estrogen is the glucuronidation process and glucuronic acid production depends on glucose availability,

would you say that...

Sulfation.

Sulfation, yes.

Would you say that the presence of sufficient amount of glucose in the diet, of carbohydrates in the diet,

is vital for the proper excretion and deactivation of estrogen?

Yeah, I think so.

The glucuronic acid is related to the vitamin C producing system and that requires the normal flow of carbohydrate through the system.

Great stuff. Before we move on, Ray, was there any other part of your newsletter that we should touch on before we move on?

Nothing occurs to me.

Okay, great.

I have a question about lipofuscin.

What is the mechanism through which lipofuscin inhibits the electron transport chain?

Does it bind to one of the complexes directly, such as cytochrome C oxidase,

or does it simply impede the flow of electrons by its accumulation and, I guess, electric repellent forces?

My basic idea is that it's consuming the oxygen and the electrons that should be available to the mitochondria

and it's directly turning them into hydrogen peroxide and superoxide and water.

But in order for that process to happen,

basically the accumulation of reactive oxygen species needs to occur,

which suggests that a block of oxidative phosphorylation is already happening, right?

Yeah, but it's like an amplifier.

Once the process starts, you're making more heme oxygenase, releasing more iron,

getting a more reduced environment that makes the iron more toxic,

and consuming oxygen, lowering oxygen tension, accelerating the process.

Once a person in old age reaches a point where they're visibly developing massive accumulation of dark pigment,

it is extremely quick that they will go on to die.

I was going to move on, Georgie. Stop me though if you have another question.

No, I don't.

Ray, we were talking before this and I joked,

and I said, "How are things in the apocalypse in Oregon?"

And you said things are halfway through.

Instead of just going through the news and talking about all the bad things that are happening,

of course we can't do that, but can you summarize what's going on?

Is this the capitalist class winning and then winning over the working class?

How can people think about what's going on in a reasonable way?

Because it's extremely confusing what's happening, I feel like.

The ruling class knows very well how to herd people, scare them with something,

get a lemming conformist trend going,

and keep them scared and inform them that everyone is going to do it

and you'll be a freak if you don't go along with them.

And so I think they're even inflating the number of people who are really getting the vaccines.

The propaganda has reached a point, I think, that it is triggering the irritation,

self-defense reflex in more and more people who are –

as they start communicating, finding ways around the censorship,

that frightens the ruling class more and so they panic and get more absurd

in the lies they're putting out through the media.

Well, people with two vaccines becoming suddenly un-vaxxed because they don't have a third one,

I mean, should shake anybody to their core that this is insane.

And of course, I mean, that's – if I were to hypothesize, given the things I've seen,

that's just to normalize constant vaccination and that's part of the agenda for whatever reason.

Yes, three vaccines in a year and that's not counting the influenza and shingles

and chickenpox and all of the other vaccines.

They haven't revised anything so it says now adults are going to need multiple, many annual vaccinations.

Even though the information has been coming out for several years that the influenza vaccine,

for example, makes you much more likely, several times more likely than the unvaccinated

to develop a respiratory pneumonia-like problem.

So there was a huge campaign the previous year, 2018 into 2019,

to get Italians vaccinated with the influenza.

And according to everything that's known, that would multiply several-fold their risk

of developing some other respiratory disease.

So that very likely was a factor in the high mortality in Italy,

that they had been so obedient in getting their influenza vaccine.

I don't know if you checked out that Notion document I sent you, but there were two tweets.

One was from Marx in 1842 and another one from Illich in 1976.

And it seems like people were sounding the alarm on the possibility of a medical dictatorship.

And so I'm sure given the amount of things you've read,

probably a lot of people have talked about this, that it would come to some kind of technocratic medical nightmare situation.

There's a movie called V for Vendetta, which was fairly recent, which was exactly about that.

I haven't seen it for years.

Ray, did – I mean, you've read a lot of Illich's stuff. Was that something he was chronically talking about?

Oh, yeah. He saw education and medicine as the two basic evils of our society that were destroying humanity.

What about technology? The Unabomber thought technology is at the core, is the actual direct agent.

Do you agree with that, of the destruction?

Well, yeah, the way technology is used in indoctrination, the existence of the technical knowledge itself needn't be harmful,

but they create this ideology of the digital view of consciousness, for example, that's separate from technical understanding.

If Norbert Wiener had been followed, there wouldn't have been this digitized reality quantization of everything as part of the philosophical reductionism.

That reality is discrete instead of continuous.

Yeah.

Ray, by the second vaccine, third vaccine, and impending fourth vaccine, would there be something a person could measure on a lab test?

Would their aldosterone be through the roof or something with inducing that spike protein? Would there be something they could identify?

Inducing the spike protein? I'm not sure what you mean.

Like if somebody was skeptical that these vaccines were harmful, could they get a blood test for something that would demonstrate that their physiology was completely out of whack?

Oh, yeah. I think the antidepressant would be pretty high.

That's an accurate blood test?

Yeah.

Interesting. I've never had a measure.

I don't know if you've seen the news, but China is embarking on a massive vaccination campaign to vaccinate 1.1 billion people by October 1st.

What do you think is behind that? Is China also under control of the powers that be?

Or do they have another motive, afraid maybe that if this virus narrative falls apart, maybe CIA or who knows who else will release another virus and that one won't be as benign?

Yeah, I think China keeps in mind the history of germ warfare of the United States, and that's probably part of their thinking.

But they also collaborated with the United States in that Wuhan Institute of Virology on this gain-of-function research.

So is that a case of keep your friends close, your enemies closer? Does China just want to get an idea of what the Americans are thinking of unleashing?

Or do you think China is on board with this whole globalization plan?

I think it's a faction in China. I think the president, he intervened and sort of cut down the Fauci faction.

Oh, I see. So that may be behind his announcement that he's going to redistribute the wealth, make China more equitable?

I guess, yeah.

I was going to move on to questions. Georgie, stop me if you have any other.

So before this, Ray, I gathered a bunch of questions from people that watch this show.

And so I thought we would run through them and then let you go.

Guys, give this episode a like. Sincerely appreciate it.

We have an amazing listenership that hangs out every Friday.

So, guys, thank you so much, Georgie. Thank you, Ray. Thank you.

So my number my first question here was hopefully like a clarification of Georgie and I were talking about collecting the urine and each liter being about a thousand calories.

But I think I might have Georgie might have said it correctly and I might have goofed it.

But can you just explain that that test, that at home test for collecting urine and how to quantify how many calories you're burning real fast?

No, I don't know how it would be used for counting calories.

Well, didn't you mention that if you discard the morning urine, then you collect the urine the rest of the day?

Couldn't you do some kind of math and then figure out how many calories you're burning?

If you measure your water, total water intake and urine, then you know how much water you're evaporating.

And that goes up as you burn calories. So you have to know the water balance.

So you basically perspire about a liter of water for every thousand calories burned, right?

Yeah. Yeah.

My apologies to Georgie, because I butchered that and I said you were wrong.

So my apologies, Georgie. Thanks for clarifying that.

Speaking of something else you can clarify, I have a quote from you in 2012 and it says, I have known, this is the relevant part,

when it's taken to small doses, 50 micrograms of T3 will usually normalize any hypothyroid metabolism.

And I actually send that quote to a lot of people and I just wanted to like bring it back up since it's nine years old and see if you still felt similarly about that kind of upper cap of 50 micrograms of T3.

That's just the equivalent of the old standard two grains of armor.

It's partly just an arbitrary number because it varies so much with individuals.

But roughly 25 micrograms of T3 sums up about the same as as one grain of armor.

And since the average replacement dose used to be two grains of armor, that's where that 50 micrograms came from.

And if somebody was taking 50 micrograms, like the people that you know who have done that, do they take 10 micrograms five times per day with food or do you split up even smaller?

Yeah, either way, but for sure split up so it comes in gradually.

Good. Stop me at any time, Georgie.

Another question from a listener here, and they said, I'd like to hear from him about some of the reasons that he is so upbeat about Mexico.

The ones that you mentioned he talked about on the call that you were on with him.

In fact, I'd like a whole show about Mexico, he says.

So I mentioned on a live stream saying that we were on a call that I didn't set up by some other people and you were very positive about Mexico.

And so I think that's on a lot of people's minds right now of, hey, I got to get out of the US or I got to get out of somewhere else.

And I mentioned that you had a very positive view of Mexico.

If you want to reiterate any of that, I think people would enjoy it.

The objective evidence is that I guess it was about 20 years ago, Cuauhtémoc Cardenas really won the popular vote, but lost the election by fraud.

And the fact that in actual votes, as well as electoral success, AMLO had national support.

The fact that the great bulk of the population supports those two individuals shows a lot about the quality of the country.

Very, very different from European-American consciousness.

Do you think there's any truth to the claims that there was election fraud in the last election, in the presidential election in the US?

I mean, if this can happen in Mexico, why couldn't it happen here, considering the sophistication of the three-letter agencies?

Yeah, the use of digital voting machines operated through computers.

It's the perfect way to hide the fraud to some extent.

Black Box voting, when it was pointing out fraud by the Republicans, was a very popular website.

But I think they're still in operation, but no one wants to investigate fraud by the Democrats comparatively.

Do you think the court system has been completely compromised, or at least compromised to the point where even if evidence is unearthed, it will simply go nowhere?

Yeah, I think the courts are well-packed with state supporting, no matter which party. It doesn't really matter that much which fascist party you're keeping in power.

Ray, before I read off more questions, is there anything you want to say about Afghanistan, and is there anything you want to say about the so-called FDA approval of the vaccines?

Oh, I think there was a possible positive interpretation for Biden wanting to do what Trump wanted to do, get the army out of some of the wars.

And I think today's bombing probably was the factions that can't afford to have any decrease in war expenditure.

The trillions that have gone through the military industry in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, they don't want to see the tap turned off to their endless money supply.

Do you think Biden's decision to withdraw, was there anything good behind it, according to you? Or do you think it was more along the lines of a political move because midterm elections are coming, he wants to please the war-weary public, money can be spent on other things, the public really doesn't want any more wars right now?

Yeah, I think their interpretation of natural positive action by Biden is reasonable. But the faction that doesn't want to stop the war will kill lots of people to try to get the reoccupation going.

Great stuff, thanks for that. Okay, here's another one. Ray has previously mentioned that his favorite animals are ants. Are there any animals that Ray considers to be evil or malevolent, such as mosquitoes or hyenas?

I don't think so. It's just what they interpret as food that isn't compatible with our well-being. I noticed someone who asked the question, I think, had the name sandwich.

It's a matter of perspective. Mosquito and hyena see lunch when they smell a person. It's just in conflict with human preferences.

You have a good memory for remembering that. On that note, do you think that hunting for food is not an immoral activity for a human?

Yeah, if there's actually a reason to hunt for food, if they really need food. It's like a hyena. You can't say that they're having evil thoughts just because they have a different idea of what lunch is.

That's exactly the context I was asking about. If a person is hungry, and if food supply becomes a problem, or becomes too compromised, and all you have is a gun in the wilderness, then it's a matter of perspective.

Yes, it's a living creature you're destroying, but you're not doing it for fun. You're doing it because you saw food.

Semi-related, but do you have any favorite examples of mutual aid in the animal kingdom?

Oh, there are so many of them.

People are impervious to that idea that nature isn't anything but terrible and harsh and cruel. That's why I feel like just getting your thoughts on it is useful.

You can see a lot of videos on the internet of animals expressing grief and gratitude and mutual support and so on.

I watched one, and it must have been a tiger or something, and a bird had fallen into a tar pit, and the tiger went over to it, grabbed onto its wing, and swung it out of the tar pit. It was pretty good.

I have several other examples. There are several videos on YouTube where you can see how a herd of buffaloes saves an antelope that a lion has basically latched on.

The buffaloes will go in and kick the lion. Usually the lion leaves when he sees a herd of buffaloes, but if he doesn't, then he'll get kicked out.

This is a very common example of how people are playing with it, not really treating it as food, and just letting it be.

I've seen videos of people releasing a grizzly bear from a trap, a very large Canadian gray wolf from a trap, a bobcat, and I think even a mountain lion.

Typically, if you get that close to these animals under normal circumstances, you will probably get attacked.

It's amazing that these animals were basically just sitting there quietly, allowing the human to free them up, and in some cases, after that, they refused to leave.

They just kept following the human around as if they somehow became friends.

Yeah, actually, animals show gratitude and friendship.

Have you seen this in birds? In one of your books, you mentioned that birds are apparently really good at trying to get people's attention and form cooperative relationships.

Yeah, and you probably remember the story I told about the ant.

I put out an ant that was drowning in honey, and its head was exposed.

An ant came along and found a drop of honey, but it ran around to see how big it was, and it saw the head sticking out and jumped back in shock, and then discussed the situation for a while.

Very agitated communications, and then it went around to the side and sat down and started eating.

Another ant came along, did exactly the same thing, jumped back in shock, except this time the communication was very short, and it went around and started eating honey.

I didn't stay there to see if more ants came along and did the same, but when I came back an hour later, the drop of honey and the ants were all gone.

Oh, wow. Do you think ants communicate strictly to chemical messengers, or do you think they can do electromagnetic things, too?

They were obviously doing some kind of sign and touch language.

The first one, they would discuss it a while, and the arrived ant would run around, and they would talk about it some more, and it ran around two or three times, describing how big the drop was before it started eating.

So these stories about a horse whisperer or a wolf whisperer or whatnot, they actually have basis in reality.

Apparently, people can learn the language of animals and communicate with them.

Yeah, I'm convinced that ants, for example, have lived around people enough that they've learned English or whatever language they're around.

A couple of times when ants were bothering a roommate who was going to get some ant poison, I just firmly and clearly said, "If you don't leave, that person is going to poison you," and they just disappeared.

You're saying we could experience a Coco the Ant-like situation with sign language. One day we could figure out the ants' language with their arms and things like that?

I think so. It's obviously a very efficient language that can take a new, totally novel situation like that and size up the nature of the problem.

So the second ant arriving got the idea in just a brief conversation.

I interrupted you. Did the ants that were bothering your friend, did they just quickly go away, or what happened?

Yep, it just disappeared.

Great stuff. You know, I have one more question. You called mushrooms an inspiration based on their structure and what they're able to do. What are so special about ants? Why are they so amazing to you?

At a relatively low body temperature, they can be so quick-witted. As they get very cold, then they slow down. But they think and calculate just with amazing efficiency. Basically as smart as anyone.

Do you think them living in those burrows, basically just like the naked mole rat, they're exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide?

I think so, yeah.

Have you seen the studies showing that ants don't age? Basically they die either from a predator or a trauma, basically. Something squashes them. But they don't really age.

That would be the outcome of living in a high CO2 environment, I think.

Okay, we'll jump to another question after talking about ants for 20 minutes. Macaroni Delta says, what advice can Dr. Peat give regarding the best way to treat romantic grief, i.e. a broken heart? What a physiological or philosophical approach to it be most effective? I think he had more there, but I cut it off.

Find a substitute or replacement.

That's excellent.

That's funny because that's what the dating community would say, is quickly find somebody new. Why do you say that?

It works.

So do you think the concept of a soulmate is basically just a fairy tale? In other words, there could be many soulmates?

Yeah.

That's really funny.

Okay, here's a philosopher. You may have heard the expression. I'm blanking on the name. It was a European philosopher. He said that love is the illusion that one woman is more special than another. I guess this can be extended to both sexes. In other words, you can fall in love many, many times and you'll be just as good if it's with the right person.

Yeah.

Great stuff. Okay, here's another one. Can you ask Dr. Peat to expand on his views of ontology? He has talked about Meinong previously. Thanks.

Yeah, the ontologists have usually been confused, getting mental processes confused with thinking about the nature of reality itself.

And the idea of continuity and of interaction constantly. Everything is impressing its aspects on everything else.

And so the nature of being is constantly changing as the world evolves. The substance itself is changing in the ontological sense, the same way a cell changes with experience.

And that's related to William James' radical empiricism, right? Same thing?

Right.

Speaking of him, did you know that he had a concept about stress called reservoirs of power? Did you ever read about that?

Nope.

I was reading a book and it was talking about Hans Selye and then it mentioned Canon and it talked about early concepts of stress.

And then it mentioned William James and I was like, what the heck? I thought he was a philosophical person.

And then I found a few mentions of something called reservoirs of power.

And he was basically talking about what I interpreted to be an extreme stress state bringing on another level of accomplishment.

But it was just interesting because he's clearly talking about, okay, here's the actual quote.

William James suggested that every person, there are reservoirs of power which are not ordinarily called upon, but which are nevertheless ready to bring forth streams of energy only if the occasion presents itself.

I don't know, you're familiar with those earlier concepts of stress. Were there any that were interesting to you?

No, not especially.

Okay, we'll jump to another question here. Thank you guys so much for hanging out with us for Friday.

Ray, I won't keep you too long. I'll let you go very soon. Thank you so much for hanging out. Thank you, Georgie, for making this possible.

I have a question about this reservoirs of power.

There are well-documented cases where mothers are basically capable of lifting cars just to save a child that's been pinned underneath.

And under normal circumstances, they're not known to come anywhere near close to that level of being able to muster up so much power.

So, I mean, do you have an idea what may be behind this mechanism? What could be causing the southern and clearly unnatural or at least not normally present amount of muscle contraction force that these women can muster up?

Is it some kind of a steroid reaction?

A very good coordination of the chemistry and the nervous innervation, I think, strengthens the fascia and muscles in a physical way that makes the parts stronger to meet the needs of the moment.

So what would the – I mean, clearly, since these women are not being able to muster up those powers on demand, it's only under extreme circumstances.

Is there any way this can be trained in a person, in other words, to be – to sort of like improve the condition, the physiology to get closer to that clearly higher potential that we have?

Yeah, I think it involves things like getting up your pregnenolone basic level and DHEA that strengthens the substance at all levels.

Great stuff. Ray, I'll only ask you two more questions and then let you go.

So this one's from Christian, wondering if you could recommend a safe and prothyroid way of oil painting.

Maybe what substances and habits to avoid when painting.

Also, maybe if he could talk about his own personal painting practice.

I try not to use my fingers too much, but I'm always tempted to smear the paint with my fingers.

That's not a good idea generally. And to have a very good ventilation is the other essential thing.

Great stuff. And then we'll kind of end it here. Could Ray describe what a typical day of eating looks like for him?

Very random in a sense, because I got tired of doing it one way and so innovate constantly.

The common themes are milk, orange juice, eggs, cheeses, occasional cheese tacos, various soups and so on.

And orange juice seems to be one of those difficult things to find.

Are you using orange juice concentrate right now or do you have a good source of oranges?

No, bottled pasteurized orange juice.

Oh, interesting. Do you have a brand? Because I know a lot of people, I get that question all the time.

And I haven't been in the US for a long time and I'm not sure what's good or not.

No, it was just trial and error. I don't remember the brand.

Awesome. We'll do one more advertisement here. The newsletter, Ray Peat's newsletter that we were talking about earlier is $28.

You can send that to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. You can order Ray's books by sending that email,

a name of the book and they'll send a digital copy to you.

And then you can order Progest-E from Keenogen, email Catherine, who's very nice and send it out very quickly in a package that provides protection for while the progesterone is traveling.

And that is it. Any final words here, Ray, that the world is going crazy and things are hard to deal with right now.

Is there any piece of advice you could give to anybody to maintain?

Keep learning about the virus. It's currently the most important thing about the reasons for the great dangers of the vaccines.

And then, Georgie, you as well.

Last question, really, do you think that the powers that be are winning?

I mean, I can see it going both ways because this whole technocratic nightmare that they're trying to impose depends on turning the entire population depending on the state.

But the United States is not really – the empire is not really in a financial position right now to sort of endlessly pay people to do nothing and become dependent simply because it's in such a massive amounts of debt.

And if you look at this fiat currency thing and the printing, they cannot go on forever because it will essentially destroy the dollars, the reserve currency, and then the dream of the neural order people is going to go down the drain too.

Yeah. The people getting conscious is the essential thing and it has to advance at a faster rate to prevent the death of the whole system.

Great stuff. Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much. Ray Peat, it's an honor. Thank you so much for hanging out and continuously hanging out with us and talking. It's so fun.

Guys, thank you so much. Thank you so much for listening, guys. Have an amazing weekend. Guys, thank you. Have a safe weekend. I'll talk to you guys soon. Okay. Bye, everybody.

[Music]Hey guys, welcome to General Energy Podcast #70. Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov. Ray, I just

interrupted you, but we were talking before about like, what was your take on Australia?

And I thought you had an interesting take that I really haven't heard before, so I thought

everybody would enjoy that.

For several decades, it has seemed that they've been heavily manipulated by the CIA or whoever

the world manipulators are. And so I see their extreme reactions as being a test case for

how fast they can get away with imposing stuff on different parts of the world. But I think

the reaction there is strong enough that maybe they're going to hold back and think of something

a little less crude for the US and Europe.

And then we also talked about, I told you I was a little confused on why the power elites

would want to turn the US into a third world country. And we were talking about just the

possibility that the citizenry of the US are the last remaining threat to the power elite.

And once they were subdued, they could do all their illicit, weird activities without

any interruption.

Yeah. In one of her recent videos, Lee Merritt, an anti-vax physician, she said that in her

state the number of people who own guns would be the equivalent of, I forget what it was,

the fifth largest army in the world.

Why do you think they don't simply own guns? They also regularly shoot them. So they're

there. Well, maybe they're not on par with an active military, but they can put up a

probably a pretty decent resistance if things really start getting ugly.

Yeah. Even though the firepower is like a million to one in favor of the Pentagon, the

actual ground level situation, if you have a thousand people with little guns and a hundred

soldiers with bazookas and tanks becomes a better balance.

Do you think the Pentagon has managed to vet its, what you call it, the most loyal soldiers

it has to the point where they're completely confident that none of these people will turn

on them if they're being ordered to attack their own, like their own families?

I think that's the purpose of Biden's talking about dishonorable discharge for people who

don't get vaccinated. He doesn't want any ambiguous people ambivalent about following

orders once he gets the vaccine resistors out, then he's got a nice robot army.

So we can expect something really bad when all those people are vaccinated, all the soldiers.

Yeah. If they're really giving them the same vaccine that is causing the CDC's death and

disability numbers to rise astronomically, then it's going to weaken the army. But I

would suppose that they know better than to give the regular vaccines to anyone they want

to rely on.

Did you see that the CDC chief, whatever her name is, she overruled her own advisory committee

and basically went against the recommendations. The advisory committee said, no, most people

don't need a booster as corrupt as we are. That's too much even for us. And she said,

nope, I'm going to overrule you. Is that legal under federal law? Does the agency have like

supreme power over the agency?

The agency's concept are internal regulations. I've interacted with some agencies that just

really didn't take their own regulations seriously.

So what I'm hearing is that these advisory committees are largely ceremonial. Basically,

they're just sitting there making mood decisions, but ultimately it's the agency head.

Yeah. Just for giving it a little prestige.

I'm scrolling through looking for an article, but it was talking about during H1N1, the

government class was issued different vaccines than the population. And so what you're saying

is like rooted in the mainstream article that I had come across at some point.

Several people have been talking about the evidence that several different vaccines or

non-vaccines have been issued and the elite get the non-vaccines.

Just a week after it emerged that German armed forces were getting a different kind of H1N1

vaccine to the general population, Der Spiegel magazine reports that the government will

also get special treatment.

What you sent me Dolores Cahill's video, and she was talking about an interesting way of

kind of holding people accountable that were forcing vaccines on people. Can you talk a

little bit more about that?

A personal liability lawsuit is one of them. You have injured me and I'll take you to court

and get redress. Another one was making them aware of the fact that they're committing

a crime. If they do anything to coerce someone in any way, but especially to take an experimental

medical treatment, that is worse than simple undefined coercion. But coercion is a felony

in some states and a serious misdemeanor in all the rest. Federal law allows up to three

years in prison for coercion.

But these lawsuits, they would only apply to actual to the actual doctors, the private

industry, because the government officials have qualified immunity, right? Just like

the cops. They cannot be sued for doing bad things to us.

Yeah, but your employer who is administering the illegal regulation, they would undoubtedly

say it was just following the orders. But that has not been working very well.

So even though OSHA can mandate the employer and say, look, we're going to fine you if

you don't vaccinate your employees and the employer does, that the employer is kind of

caught between a rock and a hard place because both places can attack, right?

Yeah. And if the employees make it expensive by suing their employers for damages, if they

get fired, then the company has to start thinking which side they'll take.

Many of the small ones will probably just simply simply fold and close shop, which I'm

starting to think that may be that may be one of the desired side effects, even if it's

not planned.

Well, the plan as expressed by Eric Schmidt two years, more than two years ago, it was

in line with the Rockefeller Foundation and other long range plans. But the Pentagon Committee

that Eric Schmidt was the chairman of outlined the need to destroy the existing economy of

the United States so that it could be quickly replaced by a digital artificial intelligence

economy that was expressed in 2019 before there was a pandemic.

You can see this basically, we all shop from Amazon, we all get our I.T. from Google and

we all get our health care from a single whatever mandatory provider that we don't even get

our health care. We we are administered health care against our wishes.

Yeah. And as the small businesses went broke, the Amazon and other giant corporations just

about doubled their wealth.

Yeah. The office building that I'm that where my office is basically the company that was

renting it out to small companies like me. They went bankrupt and BlackRock, the large

the massive financial company, moved in and bought all the real estate in D.C.

Yeah. Right. Do you have opinions on Vanguard and BlackRock and how they own a lot of the

huge major corporations? Like people think there can't be coordination between these

huge like so-called private corporations and stuff, but apparently they own like everything.

Yeah. I saw someone analyzing the tentacles of Vanguard. They're everywhere with five

or six percent ownership where they can have a strong influence.

You know who I think did?

They're just about identical with the World Economic Forum in their policies and reach.

The guest who owns the private funds behind Vanguard, it's basically a who's who of the

new cons, the Bush family, the Rumsfeld family, the Clintons, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.

Yeah. So no surprises here. I guess how this thing is unfolding. Is there anything you

think is incredibly weak or a route to escape? Or do you think it's they're more or less

the plan is going according to how they planned it?

I think it's going according to the plan.

You don't see any glitches in their push for the vaccine for everybody and for the lockdowns.

I mean, I can tell you as liberal and woke as DC is, if another lockdown is attempted

here, even the liberals will revolt and probably hang the mayor if she tries something like

that.

It would be good to see.

Right. I'm saying that even those people who were convinced initially that this is a good

thing and they're trying to save the world and everybody should be vaccinated. They've

had enough of basically being stuck at home with the screaming children and doing the

work of both teachers and doctors and everything and doing their own work. So even the I don't

know, the cool cities, I think the population has had enough. So I just don't see another

lockdown unless there's a false flag operation with another virus or something militarily

happens domestically.

They keep talking about alternative panic producers like a sudden breakdown of food

supply or banking crashes, Internet shutdowns and so on. They've been talking about that

for so long. I think it means they have something in mind, not necessarily those.

In one of the in one of your articles, you talked about how the Appalachian region has

the lowest death rate from breast cancer, even though the rates of breast cancer are

higher than the rest of the country. And you also mentioned how extremely rural areas and

poor areas would probably not notice, you know, whenever the collapse of the world economy

arrives. So a question to me is like, is there any reason why you wouldn't consider going

to the Appalachian region? You don't think it's high enough altitude or you think the

culture there is not very, I don't know, friendly? Just curious.

Yeah, there are pockets of culture that could be acceptable, but other places, the xenophobia

basically not just according to skin color, but just having the wrong accent of an outsider

can be difficult. I would choose a completely different country where they're used to tourists

and Anglo people don't have such xenophobia.

Ron Unz has an article on his website recently about a journalist who went to Welch. It's

a town in southern West Virginia. It's the poorest town in the poorest county in the

entire country. And he basically chronicled the decline of the area, which used to be

booming in the 50s due to coal and kind of coincided with the peak of America, from what

I'm understanding. You said that the 50s was really the time where people had everything

they needed and nothing they didn't. And just the way he described the area is that because

it's so poor, they have really opened up to tourists and they're really friendly. And

there's basically very little Internet and very little cell phone service and everything

is dirt cheap there. So I don't know, sounds very attractive to me. If I have to make a

move from out of D.C., that will probably be the first place I would try.

Yeah, I think poverty in terms of the Internet culture is a very creative, highly progressive

thing.

Well, it seems like people from Monterrey are like very westernized and that's something

that...

Oh, Monterrey, Mexico?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah. Buildings there, I've seen slogans, "Hitler was right." The cops there are the nastiest

I've ever seen in Mexico. It's not just Americanized, but it's the worst industrialization can do

to a government.

Good to know. One thing I was interested in getting your take on, I'm not sure if we've

ever talked about it, but the incoherent narratives that conflict, like just watching Fauci contradict

himself like a hundred times. And I think a lot of people would tend to say, "Oh, that's

because our leaders are so incompetent." But what do you think about that being like a

strategy of terror, of confusion, like to make people so confused that it inactivates

them because they don't know what to do because nothing makes sense?

Yeah, I think it's natural for them to just talk through their hat. And it turns out that

that also is producing confusion and working in the direction they want people to go, panic

and confusion.

I have a book, it's by a guy named Kurt Lewin. I think it's like 1942 or something. And he

was some big wig at the Tavistock Institute. And in his book, he says, "If we just confuse

people enough, they won't know what to do." And even if you're like a renegade, you will

be inactive because there'll be no clear path forward of what to do because everything is

so...

I mean, that's basically what they do in the US. The people that consider themselves radicals

are aligned with Citibank and Wells Fargo with the exact things they believe.

Yeah, four years or 2016 election, I guess, I noticed that the Communist Party of the

US was supporting Hillary Clinton. That's a perfect example of confusing people to be

utterly useless.

Or it shows how little commonness there is in the Communist Party of the United States.

Okay, well, we can take the show in really any direction we want. Ray, did you want to...

you are working on something. Did you want to talk about that? Or we could go into questions.

Really we have free for all here.

Questions are okay. I'm right in the middle of thinking about what to write about something

to do with development and immunity and how the whole system has been warped so much that

it's almost impossible to talk about how the immune system works. And so it's a perfect

background for people saying ridiculous things about vaccines, for example, because there's

no solid ground for making a decisive and final argument about any issue in the immune

system. You have to see the history going back more than 100 years to see why the situation

is so muddled around the vaccine issue.

Did Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Metzinger, did anybody take them seriously? Was that more

of a static view of immunity ever a real contender against the traditional view?

Jamie Cunliffe and his danger hypothesis, I think he got right to the center of the

issue, but he hasn't been keeping up with his studies in the last 15 or 20 years. He's

hardly refined his thinking. What he did was very good. And the Polly Metzinger ideas have

been to some extent adopted by the mainstream, but in the process, their meaning has been

lost. The potential of Polly Metzinger's system or perspective was to go the Cunliffe

direction. It has instead gone the whole clonal selection right down the mainstream, everything

staying the same.

And if I could butcher that point of view, it's that tissue injury, it comes before any

kind of bacteria or fungi or anything like that. Right. And so if you're worried about

immunity, you should be worrying about limiting tissue injury.

Yeah. And our body is concerned with coming into existence and maintaining that existence

and improving it if possible. And the Cunliffe idea is that when something goes wrong, whether

it's a mechanical or radiation or chemical damage or an organism that somehow created

damage in our system, that it's a damage that our body is concerned with. And in the process

of fixing that damage, it takes out the pathogen, whether it's part of an organism or a toxin

or even radiation damage, the body takes the measures necessary to maintain its integrity

and not really thinking or designed for or evolved to attack enemies or other than self.

It's the process of optimizing the self that has a sideline. It happens that sometimes

we develop the antibodies and so on for taking out viruses and bacteria and parasites.

Well, there's some studies showing that depending on the occupation, specific occupations had

a much higher rate of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, like boxers, since

they continuously damage their knuckles and various other joints, they're much more likely

to develop this autoimmune condition. Hasn't this ever attracted attention of the mainstream

medicine saying, well, there is a connection between chronic tissue injury and autoimmune

conditions?

Very little. Twenty-five or thirty years ago, I saw a single article in which they took

a piece of cow cartilage and I forget who's injected it into maybe rabbits. And when it

was in a fresh condition, it didn't elicit antibodies. But if they just twisted the cartilage,

gave it a little bit of mechanical stress, then it elicited antibodies. And that was

like an image of how easy it is to induce the antibody reactions you see in autoimmune

conditions.

Have you seen the recent studies? I know you've said this many times, but recently they confirmed

that endotoxin is directly responsible for the flares of rheumatoid arthritis.

Yeah, I've been following that general line that any injuries to the tissue will bring

up the so-called autoimmune system. Virus infections in some of the experiments were

lethal if the organism wasn't allowed to produce antibodies. The virus that would bring up

the antibodies would in itself not produce the disease, but the antibody itself was there

mostly to clear out the damaged tissue rather than to attack the virus.

Do you think chronic low-grade endotoxemia as they call it can be a factor in many of

these autoimmune conditions constantly causing this small level of injury? And then eventually,

I guess if the organism is energetically depleted severely, then sort of like a chronic autoimmune

condition sets in?

Yeah, and things like lupus and the famous named autoimmune diseases including Sjogren's

syndrome and thyroid.

Hashimoto.

Hashimoto, yeah.

And probably MS. In some of these such as lupus, I've seen very clear diagnoses of everything

confirming that it was the so-called lupus condition causing the arthritis and other

symptoms. But just by correcting their vitamin D, calcium intake, progesterone and thyroid,

all of the symptoms disappeared and they gradually started having a regression of the antibodies.

Right, so you're saying you don't need to go on the carnivore diet if you have an autoimmune

disease?

No, keeping your blood glucose up and your carbon dioxide high from oxidizing glucose,

I think those are the basic anti-inflammatory things that will correct all of the autoimmune

diseases.

I was making a joke, but actually, when a person does eat an all-meat diet and they

do experience like an improvement in their symptoms, probably would be a reduction in

endotoxin, right?

Yeah. So many people are eating indigestible stuff that causes inflammation of their intestine

and a meat diet will simply represent the absence of toxic indigestible foods, but that

gives you very quick relief like a fast. A week of fast has very often completely relieved

the spondylitis types of arthritis and inflammation. But after you are on that diet for a while,

the excitatory inflammatory effect of the unbalanced phosphate and iron intake, a very

unbalanced diet eventually brings up other problems just as serious.

One last question about this and then we can move on. In the complex biochemical web of

all the stress substances, we were talking last time about PTH being like all roads lead

to parathyroid hormone. Where would you put endotoxin in that whole mix?

It's a constant threat everywhere and all the time. The bad diet choices will make it

take over and become dominant. But even with the best diet, just something like a physical

shock or an emotional shock can reduce the barrier function of the intestine enough and

slow the digestion so that you absorb more endotoxin. So it's very controllable, but

it's always a present danger.

I saw some old studies in the 50s and 60s showing that the main mechanism, they suggested

that the main mechanism of the increased barrier permeability in the gut during stress was

estrogen because when they basically gave an estrogen blocker, the effects of stress

on the increased endotoxin in the blood disappeared. Do you share that view?

Oh yeah, the capillaries are where the intestine barrier is most important. And everywhere

in the body, estrogen weakens the capillary barrier.

Amazing stuff. Thanks for that. Or maybe should we do a little advertisement using air quotes

here for your newsletter? Okay, the newsletter is available by email now and it's $28 US

which can be paid through PayPal at raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. You can also order all of Ray's books

from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular medicine, gender of energy, my favorite, mind

and tissue, nutrition for women, and then Progest-E from Keenogen. So you can email

Catherine to purchase Progest-E, keenogen@gmail.com. And each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams

of progesterone. And while we're on the topic of progesterone, I'm going to kick questions

off here with Marcelo's question. And he says, "Hey Danny, can you ask Ray if he had ever

seen or heard of a woman regaining her fertility taking high dose progesterone? We're talking

someone who has been infertile for a decade or more."

When I was teaching nutrition classes, there were several women who said they had been

infertile for more than 10 years. And it was a three month class. And usually there were

two or three people during that class who would suddenly get pregnant, just with almost

all of them, just with diet changes. But it was to increase their progesterone and thyroid

and to get their estrogen under control. And one woman, a medical doctor, she had diagnosed

ovarian failure when she was, I think, about 35. And by carefully taking a blood test about

every week or two, she imitated the natural hormones of the cycle with small amounts,

generally of both thyroid and progesterone. That doesn't take a huge amount when it's

at the right time. And I think, I forget her exact age, but she was in her 40s and had

been perfectly infertile for over 10 years and had a baby very quickly as soon as she

got her blood test showing the hormones in the right range.

That's amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. Okay. First question, raise thoughts on the importance

of posture and health. Does good posture come from good health or vice versa?

I think good health makes you feel springy and energetic. And so you take on the aspect

of a springy, energetic person. If everything hurts and you're tired, naturally everything

is going to slump.

I think a long time ago you wrote to somebody I knew and you were specifically talking about

maybe DHEA and testosterone causing a lot of the slumping. I mean, of course, those

are energetic types of therapies.

Yeah. And the pregnenolone and progesterone work with them. The fascia that hold up your

skin are, even though they're basically fibroblast type cells, in the absence of those protective

steroids, they go limp. And given just pregnenolone, for example, but the others all have a similar

effect, just a dose of pregnenolone will cause the fascia to contract showing that they have

the properties of smooth muscle cells besides being the tough connective tissue that holds

your whole body organs in place. And for example, if the fascia get loose, the tendons and capsules

around tissues all get slack and it can lead to the prolapse of the uterus, for example.

And several months ago, a woman told me that her doctor had planned to do surgery to pin

her uterus back where it should be, but she was using a mixture of DHEA and progesterone,

both topically and orally, and her uterus normalized. No surgery needed to hold it in

place. That same thing happens throughout your body. Undoubtedly, it's going to affect

your posture and the feeling of strength in your joints.

Amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. Does Ray think it's possible that apes are actually devolved

human beings?

Yeah, I've joked about that a lot. If the vegetarians found a very congenial environment

where they could eat all the vegetables they wanted, their intestine would get bigger and

bigger and their brain would get a smaller cortex and so on. The parts of this have all

been demonstrated. The more fibrous your diet is, the bigger your colon gets and you can

cause radical changes in a growing monkey, for example, just by the amount of fiber in

food. A poor diet very powerfully limits the growth of your brain. I don't know about the

distribution of body hair, but the length of the arms and legs is also something that's

very responsive to gestational conditions.

Georgie, I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but do you want to ask Ray that question

you talked about last time about the divergence of people that are following the rules versus

... Well, maybe I can just ask him. You'd probably do a better job. Do you know what

I'm talking about?

Which one? What do you mean by following the rules?

Like with the people that don't want ...

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically, I thought that evolution can work backwards too. Basically,

if the environment is not energetically conducive to maintaining higher complexity of species,

it's not just that apes are devolved humans. We may devolve into a lower level species.

My question is related to this lady's, is that, well, if the monkeys eat mostly leaves

and fruit, aren't the leaves very rich in the keto acids? Why would that be a poor diet?

I mean, it seems like they can get plenty of protein.

Because they're full of toxins. Lately, I've been talking more about the causes of human

development with a big brain and the areas where the biggest brains of fossils have been

found. I think if you look at the idea of evolving in reverse when you eat too many

leaves, instead of leaves, if you have a very good climate that produces huge amounts of

various fruits, the extreme concentration of calories, you can either get the necessary

proteins from the right selection of fruits, or you could occasionally add eggs and bugs

and so on. But an abundance of fruit would provide the high calorie guarantee that is

needed for maintaining the very expensive brain. The hunting diet, if you eat lots of

meat, which some evolutionists have suggested, the meat, even though it provides the essential

proteins, doesn't necessarily provide the very high concentration of glucose and the

materials for metabolizing glucose. It tends to cause hypoglycemia. In fact, the more meat

you eat, the more insulin you secrete to handle the disposition of the protein. And if you

aren't taking in carbohydrate, then the meat will give you chronically increased cortisol

and a tendency towards hypoglycemia from the maintained high insulin.

You're telling me Klaus Schwab wanting us all to eat bugs? He's on the right track?

What was that?

Klaus Schwab from the World Economic Forum. You know he's all about us eating bugs as

soon as possible.

Oh, yeah. They're, I suppose, adequate protein. Once I had some very nice things that seemed

to be like little fish patties, but after I'd eaten them, they turned out to be mosquito

larvae.

There's a Mexican restaurant in DC and they serve tacos made from locusts. Is this like

a common thing in Mexico or is this some kind of a monstrosity that they concocted here?

I never heard of the locusts, but around the lakes, you've seen the butterfly net fishermen

on Lake Patzcuaro probably. I don't know if they still do it, but they used to have these

big nets that they would skim the mosquito larvae with so they could collect them in

really nutritious quantities. And they had a pleasant, mildly fishy taste.

Oh, wow.

That has to be just pure punishment, like the bug agenda. The oligarchs are just like

mad and they want to abuse the citizens. And everybody eats bugs in Thailand. That's what

I remember. Okay, great stuff. Thanks for that, Ray. What does Dr. Peat, what Dr. Peat

thinks about life after death?

I never really think about it. I have read lots of discussion and more or less evidence

of it. A physics professor, one of the most famous physical chemists in the world, I always

have trouble remembering his last name, but he became notorious at the University of Texas

or Texas A&M maybe for doing experiments that showed transmutation of heavy metals into

gold. And after he retired, having experienced the powers that come to bear on anyone who

thinks outside of the system, such as believing that transmutation can happen at non-nuclear

energy levels, cold fusion, for example, he wrote about the history of communicating with

the dead. And his book, The New Paradigm, I think it's called, has lots of interesting

historical discussions of fairly convincing information transfer from post-living people

to presently living people.

I wish I had saved it. There was actually a great response to this question on the YouTube

comments section, but they started with St. Georgie's, "The living state is the degree

of electronic desaturation," if that's correct. And they were saying when you die, you go

down to a lower level of energy metabolism and a lower level of consciousness. Does that

sound right to you?

I think it's on a completely different level. The neutrino sea idea as the ether for interaction

of all substance, physical things like gravity and electricity, the common medium of neutrino

sea actually has pretty good evidence. And the neutrino sea can resonate for a very low

energy of the appropriate frequency, very low energy patterns can influence this ether

or neutrino sea. And I think that's where the telepathic and transgenerational communication,

how it's working.

So do you think what we call the soul may be something like a standing wave in the neutrino

sea?

Yeah, exactly.

Okay. For a layman, so the physical body disappears and we melt into this neutrino sea, something

like that?

Yeah. I'm not sure if it's still on the internet, but there was a very good video doing the

physical energy calculations called No More Secrets, a Canadian psychologist who died

first. That just shows the physical energy possibilities for these externalized patterns

that people can tune into.

So do you think that principle of deja vu that people experience, like they have seen

that before, it's basically resonating with a past, with the brain state of not even their

own, a basic of a previous life, so to speak, or a person that, I don't know, a very similar

energetically wise, if we can say that their soul may be still being in the neutrino sea.

So what we experience as ancestral memories could be just resonating with those standing

waves that are still there.

But the deja vu, where you are experiencing something that you can actually see it coming

at you, so you know, in some sense, you have already seen it. Our ordinary consciousness,

we are constantly foreseeing a little bit of the future, and we ordinarily only project

two or three or maybe four or five seconds into the future. But when you're listening

to someone sing a tune or make a sentence, you can anticipate what's coming, and there's

no simple dividing line between what's immediately past and what's immediately to come. The brain

is in ordinary things like talking and singing, the brain is very oriented towards forming

an image of what's about to come. And that can vary. Just a well-stimulated brain can

go much farther into hearing what's coming and interpreting what has just passed. If

you aren't attending to someone in a lecture, and suddenly at the end of a sentence, they

say a word that is important to you, you can wake up and replay, get back to the beginning

of that sentence, even though you weren't consciously recording it. So you can make

your brain back up and deliver something that you missed.

- I was just gonna say that the lack of clear dividing line between the immediate past and

the incoming immediate future, I think that line actually seems to extend way further

out, because there are studies published showing that people that have learned something as

little kids completely forgot it, and they went through some kind of a trauma, where

they basically, usually an electric shock of sorts, suddenly remember everything in

vivid detail from things that happened decades ago, and managed to basically reconstruct

through a story that was later verified, because I guess that event was recorded somewhere,

that they basically had an incredibly detailed memory that they were able to connect with.

It was way, very, very distant past. We're talking several decades.

- Yeah, and if you think of the incredible detail in that kind of memory that we're ordinarily

completely unconscious of, that kind of extreme detail, I think can extend into the future,

even though you're not attending to it. Sometimes the deja vu experience is when something slips

in your brain, and you forget to ignore enough of what's coming in, and suddenly you see

what's to come for maybe 10 or 15 seconds ahead.

- What do you think of synchronicity? Do you think it's a sign of us resonating well with

the environment? It seems to occur when people are in particularly good energetic state and

attentive to their environments.

- Yeah, there are a couple of very good books on synchronicity. One by F. David Peat is

a good one, pretty much the history of stories about it. But I think that's true that things

are, again, the ether or the neutrino sea, I think, is guiding causality enough that

sometimes things will choose to happen because you're ready to perceive them.

- I see. And one last question related to the, I guess, ancestral memories. There have

been several published cases of people undergoing brain surgery, and then when they wake up,

suddenly start speaking fluently a foreign language that they had never heard before

in their lives. What do you think could explain that? Would it be a resonance with, I guess,

with a dead soul or a previous brain state? Or what could it be? Because they've never

learned that language in their lifetime.

- One of the cases I read about many years ago was a woman who had been a cleaning lady

in some academic organization. She had spent years scrubbing floors and emptying waste

baskets for professors who spoke different languages. But just being present, when she

had a brain accident, suddenly she could speak the languages that she had been around, but

not knowingly attending to.

- I see. So the brain acquired, I mean, the brain is capable of resonating with past events,

though not always on demand. Something, some kind of a trigger is needed.

- Yeah. Aldous Huxley took up one of the ideas that was introduced, I think, at the end of

the 19th century and thought of the cortex of the brain as a filtering device. And when

something damages the cortex enough to get it out of the way, the full complexity of

reality can break through.

- I think I'm going to give myself a TBI to speak Spanish better.

- Are you familiar, Ray, with the Hinduistic ideas? Probably are, of prana and akasha.

Akasha, I guess, being the equivalent of the neutrino sea, where every event that ever

happened basically is recorded forever and continues to exist as an analogy, I guess,

of a standing wave. And then depending on the intellectual or consciousness state of

the person practicing yoga, they can tune into that and basically have access to all

of the events that have already happened.

- Yeah, that sort of thing, the new paradigm, has really been developing for thousands of

years in pretty much all of the cultures around the world. There's this idea that under certain

circumstances you can tune in and know much more than ordinary knowing could produce.

Like the George Wasson's story of the magic mushroom, eventually it turned out that he

was working with the government, but he was at the time just a hobbyist, a rich person

wanting to investigate the magic mushroom culture of Mexico. And one of their experiments

was to, because the people talked about the ceremonies as their mail service, just so

he could be there watching their procedures, he asked what was happening with his son in

New York. And the shaman told him that something very serious was going on. And so when he

got back to Mexico City, he called his son and found that he had got a draft notice that

day and was in an emotional state. But there are lots of stories like that where the mushroom

takers can focus in on something in very, very remote places.

- So the process of learning, would it be fair to say that it's basically the change

of the structure of that, or even the frequency of that standing wave in the Neutrino Sea

as we observe and interact with new events? Is that how we learn?

- I think so. Since very, very early, I don't really know when I concretized it, but I began

seeing consciousness as something electronic or finer, either the Neutrino Sea or a sort

of coherence of electrons, sort of like the conductive electrons in the metal. I've visualized

the process of consciousness in the brain as being this sort of a jelly-like ethereal

material that we push around with our biological activity in the nerves. But what's really

happening is that we are the resonance process in this conductive electronic or sub-electronic

substance. And so knowing, if that's what our everyday knowing is doing on its basis,

then those exceptional experiences of knowing things we shouldn't know would fit in with

the idea that we have adopted a way of using our cortex to filter out those ultra-fine

details of reality.

- Amazing stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Please ask Dr. Peat about the safety of dental implants.

Are there issues in terms of inflammation/autoimmune response or toxicity? Thank you.

- The stories I've read about the failures have made such an impression on me that all

of the successes don't seem very important when you hear about someone's jaw falling

off basically, the bone disappearing, the jawbone disintegrating to the point that they

have to put a metal jawbone in.

- I kind of forget about this, but I got my tooth knocked out a long time ago in 2009.

I have a plastic retainer. What kind of devastating things is that doing to my health, do you

think?

- Just a plastic over your tooth, I don't think it hurts anything especially.

- It's one that covers basically, it's like the front left tooth, so it covers all the

teeth on the top. It's kind of ruining a lot of the back teeth because it's constantly

there.

- Yeah, I don't think it does any deep harm, but the idea of putting a foreign object,

the teeth are separated from the bone by very special barriers, but to dig right into the

bone and put a foreign object inside the bone just doesn't make biological sense. Sometimes

the body can handle it and you won't lose your jawbone, but when it does, there's hardly

any repair that's satisfactory.

- So would you say dentures will be safer? Basically, they can do the exact same thing

without the implantation risks?

- Yeah, all kinds of restoration are preferable. Crowns can often be done on a basically destroyed

tooth.

- Amazing. This one's from our friend Dodie. She says, "We know the purpose of the vaccine,

if that's what you want to call it, but what is the purpose of the booster shot for COVID

and how does it relate to the variant?"

- The increasing insights into the appearance of the variant so-called, it increasingly

looks clear that the variants are nothing but the side effects of the various nucleic

acid treatments. The first reaction of people like Luc Montagnier was that the variants

were caused by the immunity to the first one and so the virus would mutate and become maybe

more and more infectious, but usually that kind of resistance of the host generally leads

to it becoming less deadly while being more infectious. But as the information has come

in, it looks like there might not be any such thing as a gamma, delta, whatever variant,

but simply that it's a name that's being given to the symptoms produced by the original vaccine.

And so if that's the case, then the booster shot is, if it's the real vaccine material,

it's just going to produce more so-called variants, more vaccine symptoms.

- Great stuff. Thanks, Dodie. Thanks, Ray. Okay. "Does Ray identify himself as a social

anarchist in the sense of excluding rent-seeking, forming worker cooperatives, freeing the individual

from authority, collectivism, direct democracy, mutual aid, et cetera?"

- No. I think organization, if it's allowed to develop, the systems have been very quick

to kill any incipient organization, but to the extent that they can spontaneously come

into existence, you'll have consumers, cooperatives, and producers, cooperatives, and the organization

will be what suits the people on the ground level. But if that's allowed to develop, it

will develop, and they will find the best way for these ground-level cooperative organizations

to cooperate on a larger and larger scale. So I think that's a natural course of development.

If they could, if some of these spontaneous cooperative groups could somehow take over

the state, then you'd have the problem of maybe the consumers having more control than

the producers. But if it grows up from the ground up, you're going to have to solve the

problems of each level of organization as they come about. So I don't think there's

any problem with evolving even a world-level state as long as it's based on these spontaneous

surface-level...

- Is there any truth to, I mean, the way it at least looks to me is that the social structure

and the political structure are in a sense a metabolite of the health of the people that

are building them. So if the people are relatively healthy, they can thrive under a variety of

systems without them being exploitative and degenerating into the worst that a particular

system has to offer. So instead of worrying about a specific political system, wouldn't

be the most prudent thing would be to just sort of like optimize or maximize individual

health and then see what kind of structure emerges from there?

- Yeah, because different cultures, for example, military-oriented cultures, there's evidence

that they are very tightly connected with child abuse and body mutilation and repression

of sexuality in children. Those things are closely tied with sadistic group policies

and sadistic war-making, head-chopping and so on. And you don't want one of those societies

to take over a larger government. It has to be basically an indulgent social organization

that doesn't oppress its own children.

- But in a group of healthy people, that sort of society wouldn't form to start with. My

concern is that as soon as we say, "Oh, we should prevent that sort of culture taking

over and then establishing itself," then the only way to fight such a vicious thing is

through basically other kinds of violence, which ultimately tends to be kind of self-defeating

because if you continue this conflict long enough, even the good peaceful culture will

eventually militarize itself through this constant conflict that is being going on.

So it seems to me that the only way to ensure a sort of like semi-stable existence of a

large group of people is make sure that as many of them are as healthy as possible and

then natural or non-exploitative order should arise.

- Yeah, the problem is that an urge to conquer tends to lead to conquest. And that involves

such things as being hostile, outline good food, for example. The conquest can take the

form of establishing a medical system that doesn't allow preventive methods, says everything

has to be focused on killing the pathogens, cutting out the defects and so on. So a society

that asserts the importance of being healthy is itself in danger of offending the sadistic

cultures and stimulating oppression from them.

- So I guess there is some truth to the saying that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom

even for healthy people?

- I think so. Until two or three generations, you might outgrow the sadistic tendencies

that have been inculcated for so long.

- 164 people watching right now. Thank you guys so much. Sincerely appreciate it. Give

this episode a like. All donations here will be sent to Ray. I don't think I sent you the

last donation. I've been very busy, but I will send them to you. I promise. Georgie

Dinkov, thank you so much for being here. Obviously, Ray, thank you so much for doing

this so regularly. Such a pleasure to have you on. Okay, this next question. What does

Ray think? What does he think is the role of estrogenic predominance in sexual orientation

and paraphylic disorders? So sexual fetishes, nymphomania, excessive masturbation, and porn

addiction. What do you think about that, Ray?

- One of the problems with high estrogen is that it doesn't allow sexual satisfaction.

It's the prod to seek satisfaction. It requires a good balance of thyroid and progesterone

and androgens to achieve satisfaction. And so it can lead to such things as nymphomania

or insatiability. And at the same time, it has this toxic excitatory effect on the brain.

So it can contribute to obsessiveness, hyperactivity, poor attention, everything you do to increase

your biological energy and vitality is tending to keep estrogen subdued.

- Amazing. So a similar track. Is celibacy dangerous in a relationship that will be long

term for the foreseeable future?

- I think it's always a result of an imposition, like these sadistic cultures suppress women's

sexuality in particular. And they start very early by often mutilations, including circumcising

both girls and boys to remove the satisfaction of sexual interest.

- Amazing. Thank you for that, Ray. Okay, last sex question here. Not to put him in

the public ire, but does Ray think homosexuality is optimal normalcy?

- If it's optimal or what?

- I don't really know what they meant by that, but I guess your take on homosexuality.

- I think the gist of the question is the person thinks that homosexuality is driven

by hormonal imbalances and it's not in an optimal healthy sexual state.

- Yeah, the evidence from history as well as animal experiments are that you can produce

it by stress during gestation. Everyone is abnormal in some way. It isn't something that

I think law should be involved in regulating in any way. But I think the evidence is clear

that it's a particular product of both prenatal and early life stresses.

- Have you seen the more recent studies demonstrating that finasteride can pretty reliably induce

homosexuality in animals?

- No, I haven't seen that.

- Well, I mean, I guess you can never know if an animal is homosexual or not, but they

started displaying the male animals started behaving like females and started courting

the other normal males and assumed like a mating position and basically started behaving

like females. And when they stopped administering the finasteride, basically they became asexual.

They stopped behaving like females, but they didn't revert back to behaving like males

either. And only when they were administered very high doses of testosterone did they sort

of not completely sort of revert back to acting like normal males sexually.

- How long ago was that done?

- That study is, well, it's not that old. I think it was from the late nineties.

- To tag along with what you said, if a culture is promoting stress in every way, shape or

form and then stress promotes homosexuality, it's not like a moral judgment person. They're

just expressing what the signals from the environment are telling them to do, right?

Thanks for that, Ray. Sincerely appreciate it. Okay. Let me, okay. I get this question

a lot. So this is why I'm asking. What are Ray's thoughts on Adolf Hitler and his expulsion

of banking cartels and masons from Nazi Germany? And then the other part of this question was

a little too hot for YouTube.

- He had many right perceptions, but in a very crooked way. He convinced the voters

that Germany had been close to revolution. And the fear was that the voters would gradually

support a Bolshevik type of government. And so all of the money and bank powers of Germany

and England and the US concentrated on supporting him as the barrier against Bolshevism. And

he developed a language that would convince the voters who wanted social welfare, guaranteed

employment, healthcare, and so on, good transportation and so on. He talked to them and said he would

give them socialism, but he told the bankers there would be national socialism that wouldn't

threaten to benefit anyone outside of German society. And so he had lots of progressive

pro-worker things for German citizens, but at the same time, he was following the instructions

of the money system. And his anti-Semitism was partly just to convince the working people

that he had an awareness of the manipulators of money and the banks. But he really was

working with some of the top Zionists, and they wanted pressure on European Jews so that

they would move to Israel and set up a new country. So there was collaboration between

the Zionists and Hitler for a while, but it finally turned into the murderous anti-Semitism.

But the things such as the anti-masonry, that was part of the German culture at the time.

He used those things to keep his mass support along with giving them cheap little cars and

high-speed highways, things that simply made the Germans able to be distracted from what

he was doing elsewhere.

Amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. How might Ray respond to the question of why worker

ants are sent out into dangerous conditions while queen ants are protected other than

worker ants are not reproductive, cannot pass on genes anymore? Well, queens can. Same with

bees. I wasn't joking when I said ants were observable national socialists. Their organism

also strategy is clearly designed around a collective effort to provide for reproduction

of the tribe's genetic material. And they have a rigid deterministic caste system where

sterile ants are sterile their whole lives and will readily give up their lives to protect

the productive queens.

But at the same time, individual ants can be intelligently altruistic one ant to another.

So it's a hierarchical structure, but they're also altruistic to each other at the same

case when they actually should be competitive if there's truly a national socialistic system,

right?

Yeah. And there are lots of good people doing good things in the United States, for example,

even though the system is definitely not designed to have good people doing good things.

Let me ask the question, which Danny didn't, but it's right there. Somebody asked, is Ray

Peat a communist? And I know it's a very loaded word.

I thought you answered it already. That's why I didn't answer it.

But no, there was another one where he's a social anarchist, but somebody asked directly,

is Ray Peat a communist? There you go.

I'm not sure what the difference is. If you define either of them very thoughtfully, there's

not really any difference. You want to get rid of tyranny and you want to have cooperation.

And the idea of communism essentially goes back to Christianity as the main source of

those ideas, and it has developed a lot of historical confusion around it. But the Christian

beliefs are at base, you could say that they're predominantly communistic.

Didn't William James say that Christ was a communist or something along those lines?

A lot of people have, because of his attitude towards money changers and the common person,

even the outcasts of the system, he was definitely a bottom-up person. And you can call that

anarchism or communism either way.

Do you think it's possible to have Christianity without the involvement of the church? And

by the church, I specifically mean corrupt structures like the Vatican with their history

of child abuse and financial machinations and supporting the Nazis and everything else.

Yeah, I think one of the most interesting books on Christianity was Wilhelm Reich's

book, The Murder of Christ. And he gets much of his guidance from the New Testament.

Amazing. Okay, let me search real fast for... I skipped this question. Okay. In regards

to an extremely morbidly obese person in their 40s and 50s, what are the first steps they

should do to tackle their weight? Would some fasting regimen like Alternative Day or OMAD

be feasible in this situation simply because of the danger posed by their weight? If they're

300 plus pounds and they simply might not live long enough to take the slower PUFA depleting

bioenergetic route?

And what were the alternatives?

Well, they were saying, should I fast or should I do one meal a day? Or I guess another possibility

with liposuction, like if somebody is extremely obese, what do you think? And they don't have

a lot of time. What do you think they should do?

All of the alternatives are extremely harmful. And I've wondered whether there might not

be a type of surgery to remove...

Glow?

Oh yeah, do we just lose Ray? Yeah, we do. Okay, I thought it froze. Okay, let's... Oh,

Ray, are you there?

Yeah.

I think we just... You just dropped out for a second. I think we can just start that question

over if you remember.

Okay. The amount of damage is something that can be investigated. The way liposuction is

usually done, just sort of stirring a suction tube around in the fat causes lots of nerve

damage as well as liberation of free fats into the system. And there might be surgical

ways of removing a large mass such as abdominal fat while doing less systemic damage. With

good local anesthesia, for example, I think it might be possible to unload 40 or 50 pounds

of fat without doing terrible damage. But a fast, especially if you're fat, that fat

is going to travel through your brain and liver and other organs on its way out of the

body. And so you're exposing yourself to a great prolonged toxicity. Even though I've

seen someone fast steadily for two months to get over extreme obesity, I'm not sure

your lifetime effect on your health is going to be worth it.

What about chemical interventions? I mean, there is a tremendous track record of things

like dinitrophenol being able to cure effectively even extremely morbidly obese people, of course,

under medical observation because it can easily kill you if you overheat. Wouldn't something

like that be considerable?

Overdosing on thyroid does the same thing. At the right level, it can increase your safe

oxidation of fats while helping to suppress the toxic or random oxidation. Both DNP and

thyroid can carefully controlled can reduce the toxicity of getting rid of the fat. But

I think diet high in calcium and vitamin D should be part of the program because they

will support safe oxidation and provide the nutrients that, for example, a high milk diet

will keep your metabolic rate higher and suppress the toxic effects.

Amazing. Thank you for that. Okay, about 10, 15 more minutes here and then we'll let you

go. Ray, thank you so much. Thank you, Georgie Dinkov. Appreciate it. Okay, let me find this

question. Aside from painting, does Mr. Peat recommend any other practice for positive

brain effects such as knitting, sculpting, etc.?

Whistling, singing, playing a French horn, playing a recorder whistle, playing the cello

or violin, all kinds of things that are very structured and stimulating.

Wouldn't things like gardening and tending to animals also work?

Oh, yeah.

Amazing. Okay, James says, as a social animal, humans seem to have a need to belong and experience

connection with other people. How can we meet this need in the current authoritarian anti-life

culture and avoid a life of atomized loneliness?

I don't know, but I keep looking around for what people can do. Just the simplest personal

contact if you can get three or four or more people together with a similar interest, such

as little music groups, something that is harmless looking to the society, but getting

people together, they're going to talk about their fate under the present system. So anything

you can think of to put people into personal contact, I think is going to eventually lead

to political progress and organization.

This person says, on the most recent Radio Network interview, Ray talked a little about

pheromones. He said a woman's emitted pheromones can change the way she is on birth control

and again when she stops. Does Ray know what a woman emits and what she responds to changes

in the lead up to menopause? And can a man's pheromones change as well, making him less

attractive to his partner?

Sorry, this is a really long one.

Can a woman's lack of interest in her long-term partner be due to pheromones? And last thing,

can anything be done to restore the pheromones to attractiveness again?

Good diet and hormone activity is the best thing to optimize the pheromones, but it's

true that both men and women have less of the attractive pheromones and probably gradually

increase some repellent pheromones. I think little kids emit anti-sexual pheromones that

I think they induce parental attitudes towards them. And then around puberty, the chemistry

changes towards sexual attraction. And to a great extent, I think the same attractants

are emitted by both men and women, but with some subtle variations that I don't think

anyone has a very clear idea of what a woman's attraction chemistry is. But I'm sure it can

contain some of the steroids that men emit.

Super simple question, but what is a pheromone? Like what, it's released by hair follicle?

It can be any chemical that is volatile enough that you can detect it at some distance from

the emitter. Fatty acids of different sorts work for insects and other animals, but the

most clearly defined human pheromones are derivatives of androgenic steroids.

Amazing. Let's do one last break here real fast for talk about Progest-E and then I'll

ask you one or two more questions. Let you go, Ray. Okay. So Progest-E from Keenogen

emailed Catherine to purchase a bottle. She ships very quickly. She packs it in this like

Mylar or something that protects it during shipping. It's keenogen@gmail.com. Each bottle

Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams. I have a photo here. This is DHEA in this little

thing here. And then I have a little tiny $15 scale and then I mix it in this glass thing

I got from Japan, which I'll never go back to again.

A glass of Japan. Japan, unfortunately, because I will never

travel again, unfortunately. And then you can, the newsletter is available by email

now is $28, which can be paid through PayPal. And I mean, best deal on the internet for

Ray's bi-monthly newsletter. And you can also purchase his books. And those are basically

collector's items and I'd recommend everybody obtain them. Okay. So, so again, I think we've

talked about this many, many times, but I, I guess we can't talk about it enough. So

this person says, if forced to be inoculated, are there any supplements or diet that will

counteract the harmful side effects of the mRNA vaccine?

The first thing is to consider your defenses and resistances, how you can avoid getting

it put into you. And if you can find alternatives, such as a certificate of pre-existing immunity

or maybe a form of a vaccine that doesn't contain the nucleic acids, because the present

ignorance, the reason the experiment is being done is because it has never been studied

in humans before. And so you don't know what the outcome is. And as long as it's experimental

on its surface, meaning we don't know what the long range outcome is going to be. And

the animal evidence is that there could be terrible long range effects such as increased

susceptibility to all kinds of infectious diseases or to cancer or to brain degeneration

or sterility. So if you allow yourself to be vaccinated, you're taking a big experimental

gamble that the outcome of which you won't know as long as you're alive.

Are you disturbed?

The fact that the so-called variants are tremendously increased in the people who had the vaccine

suggests that the disease effects of the virus and vaccine are essentially identical and

that is primarily through the toxic effects of the spike protein. And that is a fundamental

and total promotion of inflammation in every system, hypertension, development of autoimmune

diseases. Everything you can think of is promoted, which is promoted by angiotensin

is going to be a possible outcome of a vaccine. So the angiotensin receptor blockers and antihistamines

and aspirin were known way back 10 or 15 years ago to protect against the toxic effects of

the spike protein. The toxicity of that protein has been studied now for a long time. And

so the Chinese were among the first to realize that angiotensin receptor blockers, antihistamines

and aspirin simply by being anti-inflammatory were the first things to resort to.

So does the mRNA that's in the vaccine, does it use the same mechanism through the

ACE2 enzyme to get inside of the cell?

Well, once you get the RNA in, it doesn't matter whether it's free RNA that comes into

you after being shed by someone who is vaccinated, it most likely is either in an exosome form

or as free RNA coming out of their breath and skin and saliva and getting into your

system.

So what I'm getting at is there is no way to prevent the mRNA present in the vaccine

from getting inside of the cell, similar to how we can prevent the virus from getting

inside of the cell, the wild virus, by giving something like Losartan or anything that blocks

that specific entry pathway.

Nothing I know of. They're using a lipid for getting the RNA quickly into the cells,

but other studies show that you don't really need the lipid. It will be taken up even in

the naked RNA form and that's just a tendency of cells is to take up circulating molecules

and sometimes they can be either assimilated or destroyed, but this particular fat happens

to take the highest concentration in the ovaries that distributes it in every kind of cell

in the body.

I'm moving a house in November and I found a place that I really liked and we were doing

all the paperwork and the owner was like, "Can you send me your vaccine papers?" And

I was like, "Yeah, there's no way that's going to happen." And they're like, "Oh yeah, you

can't move in there." I was like, "Oh, great."

In Mexico?

Yeah, a gringo owned the house. But it's just a sign of the future, I guess, or things

that come. There's a very interesting, entertaining situation.

Okay, Ray, were you going to say something, Ray?

No.

Okay. Ray Peat, thank you so much. Stay on the line for just one minute, Ray. Georgie

Dinkov, thank you so much. Is there any parting words, Ray? And Georgie Dinkov, any parting

words?

Well, I guess to me, the Appalachians start looking more and more attractive. If it's

extremely rural and poor and has no internet and no cell phone service, I think it should

be considered.

Guys, we have an amazing audience. Cecilia, appreciate it. I get so many positive messages

about these shows. They're so fun to do. Took a lot of work. Thank you so much, Ray, for

making these so special whenever you're on. Thank you so much, Georgie, my partner in

crime. And thank you for the amazing audience. Give this episode a like, subscribe to the

sub stack or follow the show in some way, shape, or form. And then also send all those

donations to Ray. Guys, thank you so much. Have an amazing weekend and we'll see you

sometime next month. Okay, bye everyone.[silence]

One, and we're live, Georgie Dinkov, Ray Peat.

Ray, how are you? It's been two months, feels like forever.

Catch us up on everything that's going on with you.

Yeah, I'm good. My voice is pretty much recovered from the laryngitis.

I mean, do you think it's just the stress of everything and the winter?

I mean, I'm in a pretty cold house right now, and I've had to make a lot of adjustments

just because of how cold it is.

I think what started it was eating some bacon that was cured with celery juice powder.

It's a very allergenic material, and I think I gradually built up into a generalized allergic reaction

that was like an intense cold as far as my voice was concerned.

And you're really somebody, the only person I know talking about how really terrible the food supply is

and how so many allergens that people think might be benign or not that harmful

can cause serious symptoms like you're describing.

Yeah, the market is full of good solutions to problems that never existed.

Just very intense salt, sodium chloride, is fine for curing pork, making bacon.

You just have to then soak some of the salt out of it to make it ready to eat.

But many years ago, they found that a little bit of the sodium or potassium nitrate or nitrate

would give it a pink color and suppress bacteria growth.

And so that became the rule. But then when someone discovered that it could be carcinogenic in very large amounts,

some crops, I forget which the worst ones are, but if there's a heavy nitrogen fertilizer in commercial vegetable crops,

the vegetable becomes carcinogenic because of the extreme amount of nitrate and nitrite it contains.

So to create an alternative market, someone took the powder, the juice of these toxic industrial crops

and dehydrated the powder, found that the vegetable juice contained enough nitrate and nitrite to produce the pink color

that people wanted in ham and bacon.

And so that has become very popular now as supposedly a safe bacon,

but it has exactly as much nitrate and nitrite as the bacon and ham made with the pure chemicals.

But it also contains the complex, extreme allergens that some of these plants have.

Celery juice happens to be on the edge of toxic ordinarily, even if you aren't allergic to it.

But if you're allergic to it, then it can become extremely harmful.

Well, the great news is we don't have to worry about the additives they're putting in the meat

because nobody will be eating meat anymore soon.

Yeah.

So, Ray, everybody's just dying to hear your current thoughts.

I know we talk about it every single time, but that's the primary question everybody's always asking me.

What is new? What is happening?

Maybe we can even back up a little bit.

What is going on, if somebody was clueless as to what was happening?

What is going on right now?

In the winter and spring of 2020, I was saying essentially nothing is going on at that time.

Nothing unusual was happening in the world.

Health condition.

But the only thing that was happening was a gigantic, highly organized scheme to convince people,

to scare people that some deadly new pathogen was circulating.

And I forget which newsletter it was, but fairly early in 2020, I described my interpretation of part of the background.

What is that for all through 2019, the germ warfare lab at Fort Detrick kept announcing that it was having spills leaking designer viruses into the environment.

And finally, the parent agency, I guess it was the Department of Health, whatever,

that shut down what had been known for decades as the germ warfare laboratory.

And for them to have all of these little stories put into the press over a period of a few months,

and then to take the step of closing the whole germ warfare laboratory, I took that to be very significant.

Ordinarily, they completely covered those up, don't have press releases that viruses might be leaking into the environment around Fort Detrick.

And then that summer, there were cases of novel pneumonia that were blamed on the chemical cigarette substitutes,

but they resembled in some ways the virus that later was known as COVID.

And then the military, the annual military games between nations was taking place in Wuhan.

Early fall, I think it was, September or October, and the athletes, ordinarily the army or military athletes,

are made up of people training as Olympic competitors who use the military as a way to keep their amateur status.

And this year, 2019, the Americans were ridiculously incompetent athletes,

the historical worst showing of American military athletes since the games had been done.

And someone who had worked at Fort Detrick interpreted that the same way that I did,

that following a string of highly publicized leaks from the U.S. germ warfare lab,

then having the military circulate among the Chinese in the military competitions,

and that just happened to be before the supposed leak from Wuhan.

So to anyone who knows the history of American germ warfare,

that being so open and public about the connections seemed like any sensible potential enemy

would have to consider the possibility that the U.S. was actually preparing a release in China

of their engineered viruses from Fort Detrick.

The Chinese, I imagine, would have interpreted that about the same way I and many others did,

that this was an ambiguous announcement that there could be a germ release in China,

but it was so clumsily publicized that the enemy wouldn't want to take a chance

that maybe it was going to be a real release.

They should take some precautions, assuming that it was more than a propaganda scare.

So that would account for China being ready, having months of announcements,

ambiguously making them think there could be a release.

So they were highly organized in the way they responded,

but their response was extreme, more than anything they had ever done.

So although it on the surface looked probably like it was a test,

an activation to see what China would do, and maybe if China was extreme in their lockdown,

then China would be something to copy around the world.

I think it was within a few weeks of the Wuhan military games that there was a worldwide meeting

in New York sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, Johns Hopkins University,

and many other world powers, philanthropists and so on.

And in that meeting they worked out a model of how governments should respond

to the release of something like a COVID virus coming in from, in this case,

they suggested that South America, pigs had spread it through Africa to the United States.

But it was a detailed program to reorganize the world, and the Rockefeller Foundation

had I think the earliest explicit outline of the things that would have to be done in such a case.

And one of the articles was on lockstep, but basically all three of their scenarios

showed that the only prevention of the world catastrophe that they had imagined in this event 201,

the New York meeting, that all three of their proposals involved destroying the old economy

to be replaced by an artificial intelligence economy.

And that was expressed by Eric Schmidt formerly of Google and related corporations,

but at the time working for an artificial intelligence anticipation committee of the Pentagon.

And early in 2019 he gave this talk, basically saying that the only way to save the world economy

was to destroy all of the existing or legacy economies,

and to prepare for basically the monopoly giant corporations to take over the world economy,

to save it as the old economy was being destroyed.

So the same thing is with the Vietnamese village, the captain who had to destroy it to save it from the Viet Cong?

Yeah, and this was being delivered from all directions.

Universities, the Pentagon, all of the big foundations had exactly the same story,

and it was all coming out in the five years before the actual event, which was no event at all.

The preparations were becoming explicit five years, no, ten years actually.

The Rockefeller Foundation scenarios were in 2011, I think it was.

Go ahead.

You're on mute?

Oh no, I thought you were going to say something.

Were you going to say something?

I was going to say that at this point, at least in the United States, it seems like the narrative is done.

They try to push the mandates, but currently they're on hold.

So everybody around me, even in DC, which is probably the city that was most behind the mandates,

and they were for the lockdowns and everything else, and the vaccines,

and now nobody's even wearing masks anymore on the street.

So where do you think this is going?

Luckily, we're not going there as fast as all of the ruling class had hoped.

Klaus Schwab, the founder and president of the World Economic Forum,

at the very beginning of the pandemic, he said we were having a lot of success changing the world through the fear of global warming.

But he said that was promising to take at least another five or ten years to replace the old economy because it had to go through legislatures.

But he said now this health crisis gives us the great opportunity to move directly into the reset using the authoritarian powers of government health boards

so that you don't have to convince the public to elect representatives who will shut down the economy to prevent so-called global warming.

He said now we can do it in just a year or two because of the direct controlling power of the health agencies.

What is that new artificial intelligence economy that Schmidt was babbling about?

I mean, I know what he said, but I work in that industry, continue to work in industry,

and the whole premise of AI, at least their vision for it, taking over and replacing these workers, it's nowhere near what is being advertised.

I mean, at best, it can do maybe 10% of what's been promised.

Yeah, they're still hoping that it will quickly come along according to their plans.

But you can see within weeks, Amazon, for example, was making billions of dollars more than previously

just because if you close down local businesses all over the country, then people have to shop online.

And in Eric Schmidt's talk early in 2019, he said shopping online is a valid recreation. You'll love it.

Before it had happened, he was saying aesthetically it's wonderful and you'll enjoy the new world.

Well, Klaus Schwab, it sort of backfired, but for a while, their slogan at World Economic Forum was,

"You will own nothing and you'll be happy."

Yeah, except them, right? They will own their jets and fly around, but not us.

Yeah, they didn't say who was going to own everything if you aren't.

One of their giant plans worked to some degree because so many people are vaccinated now.

So how does what you just said tie into everybody getting vaccinated?

Well, the layers and layers of since the vaccine doesn't work at all as a vaccine and reduces antibodies for maybe six months,

then you have to get new injections. First, you need a third injection, but since that lasts only six months,

you need a fourth and a fifth. Meanwhile, the taxpayers are paying many billions of dollars to the people who are selling these toxic injections.

And so far, since the law was passed in 1986, the providers of vaccines can't be held liable for anything that happens to the vaccinated person.

They're happy to keep receiving tens of billions of dollars from the government to keep producing their vaccines, and that will go on.

It will become an annual or even more often than annual affair to update your vaccine.

So we're moving towards a model of mandated consumption of services and products, basically?

Yes, the same idea that they've been doing for years in regard to transportation.

You are legally required to insure yourself if you have a car license. And with the insurance, health insurance,

the Obama Act mandated that everyone had to buy insurance or else pay a fine to the government.

So it was a very small version of the government supporting an industry by simply requiring everyone to buy car and health insurance.

Do you think if the mandate for the vaccination fails, they may turn around and say, you know what, we couldn't make it mandatory.

But here's the thing. If you don't vaccinate, we'll cancel your health insurance. We'll force the employer to cancel your health insurance.

I didn't hear.

I mean, I said because Biden's mandate is now at least temporarily suspended.

Two courts have ruled that basically there's grave constitutional concerns, there are multiple practical concerns, etc.

And if, let's say, this mandate through OSHA fails, do you think another option for the government would be,

OK, if we can force the companies to vaccinate people, well, basically, because now there is the Obama Care Act

and the government is kind of standing behind the whole insurance business,

they will basically tell everybody who is not vaccinated, you can no longer, we'll cancel your insurance plan.

Yeah, things like that.

I think moving quickly towards more and more direct control of digital currency is one of their goals

so that there is no business going on without the authorization of the banks and the government.

Ray, what kind of emails are you getting from people being injured by the vaccine?

Oh, that's now probably 10 to 1 more often than what can we do to protect against a viral infection?

What to do after you've been poisoned by the vaccine and listing the kind of symptoms you're experiencing.

And those symptoms just being the result of the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, do you think?

Yes, sometimes directly following the vaccine, other times things such as bleeding episodes,

sudden series of nosebleeds or dysmenorrhea in women, babies even starting to have vaginal bleeding.

Just the benefits apparently are being produced by the shedding of the vaccine material,

putting the spike protein into unvaccinated people from vaccinated people.

How big of a concern do you think that is? Would that effectively make staying unvaccinated almost pointless?

Because if everybody around you is, then they'll shed it on top of you too?

The worst shedding fades out after the first few weeks, so hopefully that amplification through shedding shouldn't get out of control.

But it's enough to make a person want to avoid crowds for a long time.

So basically since they're now planning for this to be a booster every six months, maybe every six months the unvaccinated should self-quarantine?

No, I think we should get together and insist on quarantining the vaccinated people for at least a month.

Yeah, let's see how this happens. I would love for this to happen, but I don't see it happening.

Ray, what if your significant other was vaccinated?

Would you think the companionship and love would be worth inhaling the spike protein?

I think I would keep my distance for a few weeks.

Do you suspect they might have a placebo? This is a big, gigantic experiment. Do you think not everybody is getting the same vaccine?

No, I think the more or less insiders, you don't want to have famous people disappearing, dying, or having a stroke after getting vaccinated.

So I think they are very selective in avoiding giving anything but a pure water injection to the great majority of the prominent public figures.

Wasn't there some kind of a ruling, I don't know if it was a presidential order, but something about presidents of the United States are never to receive medical procedures live on air in front of the entire public,

just because of no matter how minute the chance is, if the president croaks or gets an anaphylactic reaction or whatnot, that would have devastating consequences and could trigger a collapse, right?

So I would take it with a big grain of salt if a president of the United States is taking the vaccine live on TV. Would you say that's a fair assessment?

Yeah, not just the president, but probably something like 80 or 90% of people who are very public.

And it feels like at the beginning of the year we're talking about, should pregnant women get vaccinated and now it's 5 to 10 year olds or whatever, and then Fauci just said babies and newborns should get it.

Did I just make this up? Does it take 30 to 50 years to figure out the side effects of any given drug or vaccine?

Yeah, at least 50 years because it can be transgenerational. Cancers take 20 to 40 years generally to develop, but like the DES babies of the 1950s,

their children, three and four generations after the DES exposure, are still developing that range of unique cancers, reproductive system cancers.

And do you have any theories on how they'll cover up kids getting myocarditis and dying after being vaccinated?

Oh, by not investigating them at all. People like Fauci just say the vaccine is perfectly safe, nothing's happened.

They don't do autopsies, they don't do official investigations while the VAERS report of harmful effects from vaccinations.

While those reports, which are even more time consuming to do so that most doctors don't want to waste hours filling out the reports,

even as difficult as it is to file a vaccine injury report, the graph showing all of the deaths from the major vaccines going back 10 years or more

are minimal compared to the last two years since the vaccine. It's at least a hundred fold increase in these reports,

but they are not happening according to the government because no one is investigating and doing statistics on them.

A few individuals, a businessman named Kersh has a good video showing you how to go into the VAERS system and look at their data.

The graph he prepared is ridiculous. It's a flat line in preceding 10 or more years. Suddenly the line zooms up very vertically.

So it's a hundred times as much per year or more than a hundred times.

So what do you think is next in store for the US?

Because again, what I'm seeing around me, and I don't want to even mention more Republican states, I don't think the COVID narrative works anymore.

So something must replace it because people are not afraid of it anymore enough for them to accept further encroachment of their so-called rights, whatever remains of them.

I think they're working on many alternatives. They're talking about the things that could happen to the economy apart from a pandemic.

But a lot of ideas are waiting that could be sprung on us anytime.

Do you think a possibility will be, I mean, they'll basically crash the economy, literally the stock market and everything else, and they'll say,

"Hey, look, it was because of the virus, but now the damage is so severe, no amount of bailouts will help.

So you'll just have to accept this new model that we have or we're all toast."

They'll just basically tell you the direct story, but the excuse will be different.

Yeah. That's their business, making up scenarios through which they can take over absolute power.

Speaking of scenarios, the event 201 that you mentioned, I didn't know that Avril Haines was there and she was like the director of the CIA.

And that was in, Ray, I know you mentioned him very frequently, but Robert Kennedy's, I think his new book, he mentioned that.

I've read about a quarter of the book. It's a very, very fat book with extremely small types, so it's slow reading.

But he does a good job of tying together all of the things that are behind the virus conspiracy.

It goes very deep into the military as well as economic and education.

How is his book still being sold on Amazon? That seemed a little bit odd that they wouldn't just immediately take it off.

Yeah. I'm hoping that enough people are buying the book to eventually even get it under the New York Times bestselling list.

Is there any part of... Go ahead, Georgie.

So let's say enough people are already aware of what's going on. Let's say at least half the country knows, right?

I mean, we'll see what happens in Europe. I mean, I think the people there also know.

And now they're starting to riot and the police is starting to use live bullets on people like in Netherlands and potentially now in Austria and in Germany.

I mean, do you think that's basically the only way out?

I mean, people will rise up and we'll have to accept that not all of us will make it, but basically it's at a breaking point and going through courts, political systems, et cetera.

It's really pointless, it seems.

Yeah. That's been the situation with any fundamental change.

The establishment will always come up with something that looks like a change, but isn't at all, to distract the voting public from putting real change into effect.

The Antitrust Acts early in the century were given so much publicity.

Many people in the public believed that the government was on their side and was fixing the damage done to the public by the monopoly organizations.

So when they broke them up, that calmed the population for decades, but it turned out that they didn't reduce the profits made by the monopolists and didn't decrease the ripoffs paid by the consumers.

So the Antitrust Acts were a show.

Wasn't that true with Standard Oil as well?

Yeah. The same people owned it, but they just had different companies.

Completely off topic, but have you ever seen "Everything a Rich Man's Trick," the documentary?

What was the name?

"Everything a Rich Man's Trick."

Is what a rich man's trick?

The documentary is called "Everything a Rich Man's Trick."

Yeah, basically that was what I was saying.

Sorry, go ahead, Ray.

The government is run by the ruling class ultra-rich, and so instead of doing anything to harm the ruling class, periodically the government is used to put on a show that they're going to knock down the ruling class.

But that's exactly a scheme of the ruling class to preserve its position.

Roosevelt said his economic reforms were the only thing that would save his class.

I'm totally blanking on the family's name, but it was a Russian family.

There were people that overthrew this family in Russia, and they took them in late at night into a room and basically killed the whole family.

That was a message to these ruling class families.

They were like, "We should subdue the population because we never want this to happen to us."

Does any of that ring any bell at all?

It was like some famous thing that sent a message to various ruling classes in different places.

Yeah, Paul Potts, for example, his idea of the ruling class went far beyond reality. He was ready to kill everyone.

Apparently it was Tsar Nicholas. Did that ring any bells? Or the Romanovs?

That's what the revolutionaries did, right? They rounded up the Tsar family and killed them all except the youngest son.

Yeah, this movie starts off with that killing being this big point in time.

Anyway, Ray, with your newsletter, is there anything we didn't touch on that you think is critical? I think we just talked about what your last newsletter was about.

Which newsletter?

What was it called? "Immunology, Ideology, and Power"?

Oh, pretty much that's what we've been talking about. The power of creating a phony concept of immunity.

And we talked about the role the antibody theory of immunity has played in creating big pharma.

Touch on that because I know you mentioned it in the newsletter.

Yeah, the German chemical industry supported Paul Ehrlich's experiments using dyes, first heavy metals, arsenic, mercury, and bismuth to kill pathogens.

But when he showed that dyes had some of the specialized toxic properties of the heavy metal poisons, he used that.

A mere harmless dye supposedly would have these specific staining properties.

You could see under the microscope that the pathogen would change color under the dye and the host tissue wouldn't be stained or killed.

So he used the chemical dye industry and his argument of specificity, the magic bullet doctrine,

that a chemical drug medication should have the ability of the magic bullet to seek out, attach itself to the pathogen and not harm the host healthy tissue.

It became very dominant in the cancer industry.

But it really created big pharma when the dye industry took over with derivatives of dyes following the staining specificity idea of Paul Ehrlich.

For them, the perfect definition of a magic bullet was antibodies which had a fairly good ability to stick only to certain things,

hopefully external pathogens, and to inactivate them. But this was blended with the pharmaceutical ideal that every disease has its chemical treatment of an absolute specificity.

The reality of it was that yes, you can create specific antibodies that are very protective and specific against the specific antigen that evoked the antibody.

But it was a general idea of individualized specific attack against the pathogen ignoring the healthy tissues.

The fact that he shared the 1908 Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff, Ehrlich used the opportunity of giving the Nobel lecture to sell the idea of drug specificity.

The essential basis for supporting a huge drug industry.

In Metchnikoff's talk, the only chemical treatment he mentioned that he knew of that really helped control or cure disease was quinine.

Quinine as a natural substance, it happened to have a broad spectrum of benefit acting somewhat as a tonic to the host as well as an inhibiting action on a variety of organisms.

The Metchnikoff Nobel lecture didn't form the basis for creating any kind of industry.

So everyone just forgot about the facts that he described from the things involved in making phagocytosis possible all the way to the other end of the involvement of antibodies.

But since there was no industry yet able to deal with the extreme complexity of the actual immune system, the actual immune system was dropped out of science after the Nobel 1908 lectures.

By 1920 and 1930, vaccination and the development of antibodies became a staple of medicine and it was analogous to all the rest of medicine provided by the growing pharmaceutical industry.

Everything having to have a unique one chemical, one disease treatment so that in effect as you could identify something as a sickness, it increased the market constantly for drugs that were specific for that sickness.

Rather than something like quinine with an extremely broad spectrum of effectiveness, they were creating thousands of specific drugs, most of which turned out to be more toxic than beneficial.

There was a British writer, I'm blanking on his name, who basically wrote once that the British Empire conquered the tropical nations not because of its military acumen or its power or even money but because of its incredibly healthy tonic water which was made with a lot more quinine than the one nowadays.

I think the strongest of the tonic waters available have 70 or 80 milligrams per liter.

Just to wrap up this thought, the quinine is an electron withdrawing agent helping to stabilize the flow of electrons?

I think that's a basic part of it. It turns out that almost anything bitter tasting has an activating effect on our immune system.

Do you have any hypotheses on why that is?

I didn't hear that.

Do you have any theories on why that is?

Oh, I think it's the organism's recognition of chemical generality in the world.

We develop tastes that usually cause us to eat high carbohydrate foods, for example, depending on our needs, our appetites change.

But I think when sickness is developing, the tastes change and people start getting more interested in bitters, digestive bitters, for example, are a very old general treatment for everything.

In Eastern European folk medicine, bitter compounds are used for infectious disease and as anabolic agents.

Before the athletes had access to isolated steroids, some of the earliest weightlifting athletes in Eastern Europe and Russia were using local herbs like tribulus terrestris, which is extremely bitter in taste.

They didn't even know what it contained.

There are some articles, older articles that are written in Russia that say that the bitter tasting herbs tend to have anabolic effect.

Do you think there's some truth to that?

I haven't seen that older stuff, but there's a lot going on now with the biological meaning of the receptors for bitter tasting substances.

So they tend to stimulate some sort of a detox system in the body?

Yeah, apparently.

Fantastic stuff. So let me just do a quick advertisement here.

The newsletter is available by email now. It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal at raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com.

And then they can also purchase your books there in digital and then physical copies as well, right?

Yeah, as long as there are physical copies.

Which ones are not available right now?

I don't remember.

So email Catherine to figure it out.

Also email Catherine at keenogen@gmail.com.

Each bottle of Progesterone is 3,400 mg.

I'm interested in these substances having a quick positive effect, but I'm also interested in them having a person needing to trial and error different aspects of them.

So Ray, if somebody responds negatively to Progesterone, like they have breast pain with it or something, what could things come to mind as a possibility for that happening?

Very low thyroid functioning people are the ones who have that kind of reaction.

If your thyroid is pretty low, even at one teaspoonful of the vitamin E solution, a teaspoonful of it isn't enough to achieve a Progesterone effect.

The first thing is to make sure your temperature and heart rate are in a good range because of having adequate calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid.

Then you're sensitive to smaller amounts of Progesterone.

The Progesterone is kicking the estrogen out of the cells and it's deactivated, but it can be reactivated if it passes through an inflamed tissue, is that right?

Yeah.

All of those circulating things are picked up in proportion to the inflammation.

For example, one of the early detoxifying systems involves the liver's attachment of glucuronic acid to the substance to be excreted.

It turns out that if you stress a tissue, I tried many different kinds of stresses, low temperature, hyposmolality, various kinds of irritants and so on.

Everything I could come up with, especially the tissue, caused a tremendous increase in the enzyme that removes glucuronic acid from the substance.

So your liver can be working very efficiently to detoxify it, but if something is locally irritated and inflamed, the blood passing through there will be subject to modification by the glucuronidase enzymes.

Very interesting. Georgie, do you have any other questions before I move on to Q&A?

Sulfatase as well. Basically, estrogen has been turned into estrone sulfate.

Now they've been showing that estrone sulfate is the primary estrogen in menopausal women, even though all the others are low.

For a while, they thought that this is just a metabolic waste byproduct of estrogen that is being quickly excreted, but it turns out that it's not.

It's just like DHEA sulfate. Estrone sulfate is like a long-term storage form of estrogen that circulates and gets converted into estradiol in any tissue that is stressed or inflamed or de-energized.

Okay, here's the first question. Who is the healthiest person Ray has ever known, and what does he think made them that way?

I've known lots of healthy old people who were hardly aware that they had a stomach or digestive organs.

They just ate what was available. A lot of it is the momentum that you inherit.

There are fewer people like that now than there were 50 or 60 years ago.

Before COVID, when you'd go to the grocery store and stuff, would you notice the millennial and Gen X and Zoomer, how poor the health was of everybody?

Oh yeah. Just walking around town, you can see hormonal defects seem to be the rule rather than the exception.

Great stuff, thank you for that. Okay, does Ray have any thoughts on people's names influencing their behavior and personality?

E.g. Raymond comes from Frankish Raganmund, meaning "council protection," and Peat is a moss that was once an important fuel. So Ray's name more or less means "protection of fuel."

Over the years, I've noticed probably more than 100 famous researchers whose names obviously connected.

Like Birdfishel, the nonverbal communication researcher, or Dr. Drips, the menopause specialist, Bacon Child, the nutritionist.

Do you think this is synchronicity, or there's some other influence going on here?

No, I think it puts it in their mind, arouses their interest eventually.

They got teased as a child saying, "Are you going to be a doctor?" and then kind of stuck with them?

Yeah.

Very interesting. Okay, here's one from James. He says, "Is having a good sense of humor a sign that a person has a healthy metabolism, and are there health benefits to a sense of humor in humans and perhaps some other animals?"

Well, everything except the cultural influences are very similar between humans and animals in general.

Do you think a sense of humor comes from having a good metabolism? You're very playful, Ray. I think you're hilarious. Does that stem from your metabolism or the culture that you were brought up in?

I think a little bit of either. With animals, you can see that simply the amount of well-being and energy drives the playing instinct.

Cats, dogs, sheep, simply the sheep take a break from being normal and passive and just spend the afternoon dancing and frolicking and being silly.

Especially the lambs. Have you seen how they throw their legs in the air?

I didn't hear that.

Especially the lambs. Have you seen how they throw their legs in the air out of pure joy?

Yeah, sometimes adults do that too.

Really?

Yeah. They're pretending they're antelope.

Great stuff. Okay, Orion says, "Does Ray have any thoughts on about handedness and its effects on personality and health? I'm reading that left-handed people have a higher incidence of chronic disease, autism, intelligence, etc. What is the nature of handedness?"

I think the high energy metabolism is pretty much the whole thing as long as you have some fingers to work with.

I imagine cats often envy a person for having such good fingers. They can see that a person can do something because of their anatomy that they would like to do.

But apart from our physical shape limitations, I think the whole thing is the vitality that supports a big, hot brain and the excess knowledge that goes far beyond necessity.

It leaves this huge area for playful exploration.

If a person was functioning at an extremely high level, would they be ambidextrous?

I didn't hear that.

If a person, not on this planet right now, had a really high rate of metabolism, would they be ambidextrous and handedness wouldn't really be a thing?

To a great extent, yeah. The Russian experimenters found that handedness became extreme when neurosis was developed along with energy metabolism failing.

The healthiest in the sense of a big brain, females in particular, who have bigger brains in proportion to their bodies than males,

these excess brain conditions are where human-ness primarily exists.

Great stuff. Okay, this one is, "What does Ray do to maintain a sense of novelty and wonder in his daily life?"

Looking for it. Looking for novelty is probably the best way to find it.

And you do that by reading or watching nature or what?

Always possible.

Except watching TV, right?

Yeah, our TV burned out many years ago right after the last of the so-called liberal programs.

The guy who was Johnson's press secretary or assistant, he was the last token progressive or liberal on NPR.

And the night they cancelled his program, our TV burned out.

We just haven't thought of TV since.

Speaking of liberal, I caught up with some of my family in Thanksgiving over the phone.

The strong liberals in my family, they hadn't even considered that the vaccine would be deleterious to lower socioeconomic types.

That wasn't even on their radar.

A vaccine passport would exclude blacks that they apparently care so much about, but they didn't ever intertwine the vaccine passport with what it would do to them.

Yeah, there are all levels of awareness about vaccines.

Usually the believers that people should be vaccinated are the ones who know absolutely nothing about immunity or innate immunity.

Even the descending virologists, I've been listening to a lot of them.

They have the best knowledge being discussed, but they're really heavily indoctrinated by the vaccine culture and the antibody culture.

But in another way, BLM could be a great movement if they were actually against vaccination and inactivated.

You know what I mean?

Say that again.

The liberal people I know, they're very pro-BLM.

What I meant is if BLM protested against vaccines, they could actually be useful.

Oh yeah.

But the motivation of the group seems to be very mixed.

A lot of unprogressive, undemocratic people have kind of infiltrated the group.

How do you get your news, Ray?

I mean, presumably mostly online.

If the TV burned down, I'm guessing the radio followed similar footsteps.

And now what, only computer or word of mouth?

Occasional rumors and books and things that the situation with newspapers used to be that if you looked for the contrary of what the current government position was,

that would be where the truth was.

So you would look for the opposite.

And pretty much that's the situation with especially Google, for example.

The Google system has been arranged to make it almost impossible to use ordinary search techniques to find anything useful.

There was a Hollywood movie back in 2012, I'm blanking on his name right now, but a Nazi officer was interrogating a young Jewish girl.

He didn't know it was Jewish and he was asking where all the Jews are.

In Glorious Bastards.

He was in Glorious Bastards?

He was interviewing the father, a French guy who was hiding the Jews in the basement.

And the Nazi said, so tell me, you know, where are all the Jews?

And the guy said, well, all I have is rumors.

I don't have any facts.

And the Nazi said, oh, I don't care about facts.

They can be easily manufactured.

But rumors can actually be quite revealing.

So he seems to be agreeing with what you said, that you can kind of gauge the attitude and the direction of events just by listening to the rumors that the population is spreading around.

Yeah.

You still have to interpret the meaning, who is spreading the rumor.

Great stuff.

We'll let you go really soon here, Ray.

Just a few more questions.

And so this one's from Jan.

They say, Ray once said incidents of neurotic fatigue, anxiety and depression increased along with IQ.

Is it only related to energy and nutrient requirements or is there more to it?

E.g., culture, social subordination, isolation?

Yeah, the culture has what it will accept as the level of general intelligence and the behavior that follows.

So going back decades, studies have found that the IQ of big organizations, the top IQ tends to be in the 100, 120s.

My favorite study was at Oregon State University.

In the psychology department, this person looked at the aptitude scores.

They used the Miller analogy test, which at that time was given to all entering graduate students.

The median raw score out of 100 for graduate students was usually in the 40% to 65% errors.

That was the average graduate student score, except at Harvard it was more like 60 out of 100.

At state universities, more like 40 out of 100.

This researcher then looked at their academic record compiled over the years after being admitted

and saw that the median score on the Miller analogy test was the peak academic success.

The straight A's, successful academic career and receiving a degree.

But exactly as the scores deviated upward from the mean or downward in proportion to the distance from the mean,

the median score declined.

So in other words, the very smart and very dumb are unlikely to succeed in life?

Yes, there are lots of variations on that.

The original IQ guy at Stanford, I forget his name, did one of the studies showing that the people in the 130s

had very good academic careers for the rest of their lives.

Those with 170 or 180 IQ were the ones constantly under pressure and sensing that they didn't belong.

As a person's health improves, do they become more sensitive to stressors such as toxic smells, EMS, or bad food?

One big difference is between men and women.

The protective defense against toxins that would affect babies, for example,

women are many times more sensitive than men.

Estrogen is the sensitizer there. With the high estrogen of pregnancy, their sense of smell,

nausea, and repugnance increases.

If you do all these things, you eat well for a period of years, and you take thyroid and aspirin and progesterone, etc.,

if your brain got physically bigger and you were not providing it with everything that it needed,

would you notice more deviations over time?

You might notice little nuances about your body that somebody running at a way lower rate wouldn't notice?

Yes, and there's been a heavy bias.

You know the idea that the brain stops growing at the age of...

When I was in graduate school, it was 11 months from conception that the brain absolutely stopped growing.

It simply underwent some maturing changes like increased white matter in proportion to gray.

The people who have bothered to check a population over the years doing detailed studies every 10 years,

one study went on for 60 years and ended up when there were technologies making it possible to identify

the amount of DNA per brain and so on that found that in almost everyone, the brain substance was enlarging steadily with aging,

and the skull shape changes predictably with aging.

Apparently growing a slightly bigger capacity of the cranium.

Thanks for that. And Ray, absolute last question.

I get emails from people every day saying, "Mexico, Mexico. What about Mexico? Is it safe?" etc.

And so I know we've talked about it multiple times, but can you maybe reiterate your opinion on Mexico

and it being possibly semi-immune from all the things that are happening?

Yeah, I was just reading about AMLO's challenge to his judicial system.

A judge had ordered the vaccine be made available to children a few weeks ago and set, I think, a five-day deadline.

He definitely opposed that and there are still conflicts going on in the government,

but it looks like he's getting away with saying that the vaccine is too dangerous for children,

but it's now available to children over 12 who have a chronic disease and are arguing that they need extra protection.

But for the general population, he's not letting it become available.

So I think that he personally is constantly judging how much he can get away with,

and a lot of that depends on the foundations and the giant corporations and the U.S. government.

If they become more focused in opposing him, he won't be able to keep doing it.

But so far he has been going out of compromise well enough so that even Trump didn't try to invade.

And if AMLO was killed tomorrow, you said something maybe on the call a few months ago that Mexico would retain its spirit.

Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit?

Yeah, the people who elected him, there are really a majority of Mexicans who are very progressive

and who are conscious that the reason they haven't been able to go ahead is that the U.S. has intervened over and over,

including the murder of President Maduro and probably other candidates and presidents like Colosio.

The U.S. is probably behind the direct intervention short of a military invasion.

And so a big part of the population knows that they can't get away with fixing the economy quickly.

And then that's it for me. Ray, what are you working on right now?

The next newsletter is going to be around the idea of the menopause and that relating to the failure of energy with aging

and what things are involved in the failure of energy, especially as it shows up during the menopause.

And Georgi, any final words?

Well, one last question that was actually asked by the people in the list I saw,

whether Ray thinks there's any value to self-discipline and forming any sort of like useful habits,

or do you think a person's best life would be lived spontaneously/intuitively?

Definitely spontaneity. You've done your own energy if you force yourself to work.

Okay. So do you think there's any circumstance in life where basically one needs to sort of exercise their will,

feeling that they don't like this, but they kind of have to do it? Or do you think it would be always detrimental?

Oh, yeah. Sometimes you have to do something until you can survive without doing it.

So if it has a survival benefit, then it's worth self-disciplining about it, but anything beyond that is self-torture?

Yeah. You should only do unpleasant things if you're really forced to do them.

Amazing. Ray, thank you so much. Georgi Yedinkov, thank you. Thank you so much to our audience.

These are always extremely fun to do. And thanks, Ray, thank you for donating two hours of your time here.

Sincerely appreciate it. Stay on the line and everybody have an amazing weekend and we'll talk to you guys soon.

And thank you for all the support of this show. Thank you guys so much. Have a safe weekend. Talk to you soon.

Okay. Bye, everyone.

[Music]0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.460 Okay, Georgi Dinkov, Ray Peat, we were just talking about redundancy, prepping, and being 0:00:04.460 --> 0:00:08.120 prepared for a future where they kick you out of the financial system, tell you you 0:00:08.120 --> 0:00:10.800 can't go to the grocery store, and what else, Ray? 0:00:10.800 --> 0:00:14.000 What else will we not be allowed to do in the future? 0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:17.080 Basically, anything that spends money. 0:00:17.080 --> 0:00:23.020 And then, I mean, we're talking about prepping for a momentary thing, but if you're kicked 0:00:23.020 --> 0:00:25.280 out of the financial system for life, there's 0:00:25.280 --> 0:00:28.960 gonna have to be a rise, new kind of alternative ways of exchange, correct? 0:00:28.960 --> 0:00:33.680 David Morgan Yeah, a lot of people are getting silver, 0:00:34.320 --> 0:00:40.080 and gold doesn't work too well for daily exchanges because you'd have to chop it up 0:00:40.080 --> 0:00:46.300 into tiny pieces. But silver is convenient as a practical currency. 0:00:47.560 --> 0:00:49.280 Excuse my ignorance, but how would that even work? 0:00:49.280 --> 0:00:52.160 Like, would the person know how much an ounce 0:00:52.160 --> 0:00:57.040 or a tiny amount of gold would be valued at in exchange? 0:00:57.040 --> 0:01:01.240 Yeah, but that with gold involves a certain amount 0:01:01.240 --> 0:01:07.760 of trust that the person doesn't have some strange ally that is pawning off. 0:01:07.760 --> 0:01:15.440 But silver is very practical in the sense that you can carry enough in your pocket to 0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:24.720 feed yourself for quite a few days, and it's identifiable as silver rather than other things. 0:01:24.720 --> 0:01:25.000 And then isn't in Klaus's book, I have not read the book, unfortunately, but I think he says and it's identifiable as silver rather than other things. 0:01:25.000 --> 0:01:29.400 And then isn't in Klaus's book, I have not read the book, unfortunately, but I think 0:01:29.400 --> 0:01:33.200 he says people will live outside the smart cities and things like that. So that alternative 0:01:33.200 --> 0:01:38.080 economy, I mean, even the people pulling these heists are recognizing that that is going 0:01:38.080 --> 0:01:39.080 to be a thing. 0:01:39.080 --> 0:01:40.960 What is it going to be? 0:01:40.960 --> 0:01:44.880 Not everybody is going to live in the smart cities with the identifications and things 0:01:44.880 --> 0:01:45.160 like that. 0:01:45.800 --> 0:01:53.760 Yeah, probably 70 or 80% of the people will just do whatever the government 0:01:53.760 --> 0:02:01.040 tells them to. But if 10 or 10 or 20% of the people set up an outside economy, 0:02:01.120 --> 0:02:02.000 it'll work. 0:02:02.040 --> 0:02:06.400 And then Georgie interrupted any moment here. then, I mean, this is the last show of the year, you know. 0:02:06.400 --> 0:02:10.880 What, without getting too, like, maybe an elevator pitch, 0:02:10.880 --> 0:02:13.120 like, what, is there anything that sticks out in your mind 0:02:13.120 --> 0:02:15.440 is, like, phenomenally important or too many things 0:02:15.440 --> 0:02:16.320 that stick out in your mind? 0:02:16.320 --> 0:02:18.960 Like, what are your thoughts on 2021? 0:02:18.960 --> 0:02:20.800 About this past year? 0:02:20.800 --> 0:02:22.240 Yeah, just everything that happened. 0:02:22.240 --> 0:02:23.600 Just horrifying in general? 0:02:23.600 --> 0:02:25.040 past year? Yeah, just everything that happened. Just horrifying in general? 0:02:36.480 --> 0:02:48.100 Yeah. And the solutions are being hidden from all ends of the political spectrum. Everyone is being taught that the other end of the spectrum is out to get them. And it's really only the one hundredth of one percent which is out to get 0:02:48.100 --> 0:02:50.360 everyone else. 0:02:50.360 --> 0:02:59.720 The people that Hillary and Obama called the deplorables, they are just as much ready for 0:02:59.720 --> 0:03:07.440 an actual solution and radical change as the people who think of themselves as the vanguard 0:03:07.440 --> 0:03:08.960 and most progressive. 0:03:08.960 --> 0:03:13.280 When I was picking up a bunch of packages, there was an art studio next to that. And 0:03:13.280 --> 0:03:16.640 the woman kind of told me to come in the art studio and we got to talking. And then her 0:03:16.640 --> 0:03:20.760 husband came and we inevitably started talking about COVID. And each both of them in Mexico 0:03:20.760 --> 0:03:24.640 had three vaccines. And one was from England and the other one was from Israel. And then 0:03:24.640 --> 0:03:26.560 we and the husband and I started talking because he 0:03:26.560 --> 0:03:31.120 reads research and he when we were talking, he had to put me in a partisan 0:03:31.120 --> 0:03:35.760 box like he couldn't. He had to label me as like a Trump supporter to to 0:03:35.760 --> 0:03:38.840 entertain anything I was saying, even though I was telling him that I haven't 0:03:38.840 --> 0:03:43.440 voted since Bush. Kerry. But like it was he was like unable to entertain any 0:03:43.440 --> 0:03:46.000 idea outside of partisan politics, but he was English. 0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:47.880 It wasn't even American. It was very odd. 0:03:48.280 --> 0:03:49.280 What nationality? 0:03:49.280 --> 0:03:52.000 He was from London and his wife wife was from Israel. 0:03:53.000 --> 0:03:58.400 Yeah. English are more obedient than Americans. 0:03:58.400 --> 0:04:08.720 And then the thing I've been running into any time I talk to a normal person about this is that coronavirus is so dangerous that anything is worth however tyrannical the 0:04:08.720 --> 0:04:12.400 implementation is it's worth it because coronavirus is the most dangerous thing 0:04:12.400 --> 0:04:16.760 we've ever experienced in our lifetime. Yeah that really is if people should 0:04:16.760 --> 0:04:21.800 just start looking at some of the facts. Have you heard any of Norman Fenton's 0:04:21.800 --> 0:04:27.000 no talks about these statistics. He's a professor at 0:04:27.000 --> 0:04:34.480 Queen's University in London, statistical practical questions, and all of 0:04:34.480 --> 0:04:40.520 his papers used to be published until he decided to look at the actual figures 0:04:40.520 --> 0:04:47.360 for mortality and what the virus is doing. And any time you look at the actual 0:04:47.360 --> 0:04:57.640 deaths from the so-called pandemic, what they did was simply rename influenza and several 0:04:57.640 --> 0:05:08.240 other major causes of seasonal death, simply renamed them COVID, and it had the miraculous effect of ending 0:05:08.240 --> 0:05:13.280 death from influenza around the world for a couple of years. 0:05:13.280 --> 0:05:22.440 But essentially, just looking at the one or two weeks figures for when there's a gigantic 0:05:22.440 --> 0:05:29.040 surge in deaths from COVID, there's a gigantic disappearance of deaths from influenza. 0:05:29.040 --> 0:05:32.640 Just looking at that one fact coming out of the CDC 0:05:32.640 --> 0:05:35.640 and other government agencies, 0:05:35.640 --> 0:05:37.520 the only thing you can conclude is 0:05:39.640 --> 0:05:42.280 never was a COVID pandemic. 0:05:42.280 --> 0:05:47.920 People have had coronavirus colds hundreds of years and that's all it is. It's 0:05:48.720 --> 0:05:56.800 renaming any respiratory-related sickness and even all sorts of other things as COVID just to 0:05:57.360 --> 0:06:02.080 create panic. So I'm starting to question even the influenza. How did they know before in the 0:06:02.080 --> 0:06:07.200 past when we had the 60 to 80,000 deaths in the United States from the flu, how did they know before in the past when we had the 60 to 80 thousand deaths in the United States from the flu, how did they know 0:06:07.200 --> 0:06:10.080 these were from the flu? They didn't test them with the PCR test? 0:06:10.080 --> 0:06:18.600 Yeah, just a few years ago people asked that question and the CDC said well it 0:06:18.600 --> 0:06:27.840 might not have really been 60,000 deaths this year, but it was at least 1,200 caused by the influenza virus. 0:06:28.960 --> 0:06:32.320 Well, how about we call them iatrogenic deaths? Because one thing is certain, 0:06:32.320 --> 0:06:34.400 these people died in the hospitals, right? Yeah. 0:06:34.400 --> 0:06:39.760 So maybe that's all it is. Every year, we have at least 60 to 80,000 people dying in the hospital, 0:06:39.760 --> 0:06:44.400 showing up with respiratory symptoms, but ultimately they died in the care of these 0:06:44.400 --> 0:06:45.480 doctors. I mean, I don't know of many people they died in the care of these doctors. 0:06:45.480 --> 0:06:48.160 I mean, I don't know of many people who died from the flu at home. 0:06:48.160 --> 0:06:49.160 Yeah. 0:06:49.160 --> 0:06:56.960 And once you see the terrible emptiness of the government figures regarding coronavirus, 0:06:56.960 --> 0:07:01.000 that might make you wonder, what about the other vaccines? 0:07:01.000 --> 0:07:09.240 Did the polio vaccine really cure polio, or did suddenly polio disappear to be replaced 0:07:09.240 --> 0:07:19.320 by almost identical numbers of Guillain-Barré paralysis and other paralytic diseases? 0:07:19.320 --> 0:07:26.080 The vaccine cured the named paralysis but didn't cure the incidence of paralytic disease. 0:07:26.080 --> 0:07:30.880 Do you think this Kien-Biarré syndrome has its origin in the gastrointestinal tract, 0:07:30.880 --> 0:07:33.040 some kind of inflammatory reaction there? 0:07:33.040 --> 0:07:52.480 Yeah, the poliovirus and all of the 30s, a gastroenterologist was experimenting with distemper in dogs and 0:07:52.480 --> 0:07:57.680 he could give them an infection and then cut them open and see what was happening. 0:07:57.680 --> 0:08:07.120 And in the early stages of the distemper sickness where they classified it as a respiratory disease. 0:08:07.120 --> 0:08:13.640 All that was happening was virus infection of the intestine and reflexes from the intestine 0:08:13.640 --> 0:08:20.120 were causing the respiratory symptoms but the respiratory tissues were absolutely free 0:08:20.120 --> 0:08:26.480 of virus at the peak of the disease, it was all intestinal infection causing reflex 0:08:26.480 --> 0:08:30.840 inflammation of the lungs and respiratory system. 0:08:30.840 --> 0:08:35.360 And that seems to be how a lot of the viruses work. 0:08:35.360 --> 0:08:42.640 They first make your intestine permeable to bacteria and toxins and then it's the sepsis 0:08:42.640 --> 0:08:48.680 that triggers the inflammatory cytokine storm sort of thing. 0:08:48.680 --> 0:08:54.200 So this reflux pneumonia which they prepare for during surgery, they give people anti-acid 0:08:54.200 --> 0:08:58.880 drugs so basically we're seeing that in all of the, you're saying we're seeing this in 0:08:58.880 --> 0:09:02.040 the other paralytic conditions, it can happen even without surgery? 0:09:02.040 --> 0:09:03.040 Can happen without. 0:09:03.040 --> 0:09:07.000 So when people lie on the operating table, they usually before that they give them these 0:09:07.000 --> 0:09:11.360 strong anti-acid drugs because they're afraid that they're going to reflux and it's going 0:09:11.360 --> 0:09:13.520 to get into their lungs and cause pneumonia. 0:09:13.520 --> 0:09:16.720 But you're saying that we can have this even without the surgery? 0:09:16.720 --> 0:09:28.120 Yeah, there have been some very clear studies in which people who recover slowly from surgery or who die following complications 0:09:28.120 --> 0:09:34.680 after surgery, what's happening is the stress of the surgery made their intestine permeable 0:09:34.680 --> 0:09:40.800 to the toxins that are not being suppressed by active digestion. 0:09:40.800 --> 0:09:45.880 And if they clean their intestine for two or three days thoroughly with antibiotics 0:09:45.880 --> 0:09:52.840 before going into surgery, just about 100% of them have no surgical stress complications 0:09:52.840 --> 0:09:53.840 following the cutting. 0:09:53.840 --> 0:09:59.160 So I guess it would be a good regimen if somebody's about to have surgery, even if it's not abdominal, 0:09:59.160 --> 0:10:03.120 if it's going to be a long-time surgery, just sterilize the intestine anyways. 0:10:03.120 --> 0:10:08.160 Yeah, even if the doctors aren't, if they don't read the literature, the person should 0:10:08.160 --> 0:10:16.000 take laxatives and make sure their hormones are good, have a very fibrous diet for several 0:10:16.000 --> 0:10:20.040 days before surgery, get a clean flow going through. 0:10:20.040 --> 0:10:22.720 Speaking of fiber, I actually wanted to talk about oat bran. 0:10:22.720 --> 0:10:28.400 And so a long time ago, you know, somebody asked you, like, what were the safest grains? And I think you said mazahirana 0:10:28.400 --> 0:10:33.400 oats and maybe one other thing I can't remember. But is you using oat bran? Is that more of 0:10:33.400 --> 0:10:38.040 an intestinal disinfectant or is it a source of carbohydrate for you? 0:10:38.040 --> 0:10:47.240 The oat bran, I read that a cup of the cooked stuff, it's fairly filling and so a cup is a big serving 0:10:47.240 --> 0:10:54.120 but it has only 88 calories for regular oatmeal as maybe 250 or so for the same 0:10:54.120 --> 0:10:59.800 thing. So it does provide some carbohydrates but it's strongly buffered 0:10:59.800 --> 0:11:07.960 by the presence of a higher fiber content and studies in animals showed that over a 0:11:07.960 --> 0:11:17.200 long run, you might have to worry about some of the breakdown products of the soluble fibers 0:11:17.200 --> 0:11:28.140 that can have an estrogenic effect but in the short run, up to a year or so, its effect is a matter of the bulk and acceleration 0:11:28.140 --> 0:11:31.800 of the intestines, so it has an anti-estrogen effect 0:11:31.800 --> 0:11:35.520 for people who have been reabsorbing the estrogen 0:11:35.520 --> 0:11:37.480 that their liver tries to excrete. 0:11:37.480 --> 0:11:40.320 So would you still use the carrot 0:11:40.320 --> 0:11:43.760 when you had a O'Brien in the morning or something? 0:11:43.760 --> 0:11:47.800 Yeah, and for someone, occasionally someone 0:11:47.800 --> 0:11:51.040 has an oversensitive intestine 0:11:51.040 --> 0:11:55.620 and the carrot is too powerfully stimulating 0:11:55.620 --> 0:12:00.620 and can cause a headache or diarrhea 0:12:00.720 --> 0:12:03.600 or other intestinal reactions. 0:12:03.600 --> 0:12:09.120 So the oat bran is milder. Mushrooms are 0:12:09.120 --> 0:12:15.560 sort of in between. It depends on how you, if you grind them or chop them fairly 0:12:15.560 --> 0:12:29.040 fine, they are an effective but fairly mild fiber. Bamboo shoots are very, very high fiber content. So a little of it has 0:12:29.040 --> 0:12:32.460 a strong effect in helping to clean up your intestine. 0:12:32.460 --> 0:12:37.320 I will say, opium as a breakfast, I really don't know much better than that. 0:12:37.320 --> 0:12:41.160 It's so easy to make, it takes like a minute and even like a fourth a cup 0:12:41.160 --> 0:12:43.960 seems really filling. So it's like... 0:12:43.960 --> 0:12:50.240 Yeah, and if you put the right amount of butter and salt when you're cooking, it's really 0:12:50.240 --> 0:12:51.600 extremely pleasant. 0:12:51.600 --> 0:12:52.880 With milk. 0:12:52.880 --> 0:12:53.880 Exactly. 0:12:53.880 --> 0:12:56.000 Yeah, milk, butter and sugar. 0:12:56.000 --> 0:13:00.640 And then, but you did mention, and the whole internet knows this, but it contains phytic 0:13:00.640 --> 0:13:02.940 acid so you'd want to have more calcium. 0:13:02.940 --> 0:13:06.720 Or if you made it with milk, do you think that would balance it out? 0:13:06.720 --> 0:13:11.920 Some studies say that it just about negates the value of the milk you have with it. 0:13:11.920 --> 0:13:16.360 So you probably have to eat extra milk more than you would think. 0:13:16.360 --> 0:13:20.240 But two quarts of milk will take care of just about anything. 0:13:20.240 --> 0:13:24.200 And then I think even a fourth of a cup might have had like 500 milligrams of phosphorus 0:13:24.200 --> 0:13:25.060 in it, So that is 0:13:25.060 --> 0:13:28.620 just adding to kind of the daily phosphorus intake. Yeah. So you 0:13:28.620 --> 0:13:31.880 really need a lot of milk to balance it. Great stuff. And 0:13:31.880 --> 0:13:33.940 Georgie interrupt me at any point in time. But you know, I 0:13:33.940 --> 0:13:37.280 just moved into a new place. And I've been scanning my environment 0:13:37.280 --> 0:13:40.580 for things that might be inflammatory or toxic. And so I 0:13:40.580 --> 0:13:44.240 have some in IRA I emailed you about a bed, you know, because I 0:13:44.600 --> 0:13:45.460 fingers crossed, I'm here for a bed, you know, because I, fingers crossed I'm here 0:13:45.460 --> 0:13:46.300 for a long time. 0:13:46.300 --> 0:13:48.040 But like just open question to you, 0:13:48.040 --> 0:13:49.800 if you were to move into a house 0:13:49.800 --> 0:13:51.580 with all the new technologies and things, 0:13:51.580 --> 0:13:53.520 what do you think would be the first things 0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:57.480 that you would deem as a huge problem and try to mitigate? 0:13:57.480 --> 0:14:01.120 If it has computer stuff, I would wire, 0:14:01.120 --> 0:14:03.840 they call it ethernet cable connections 0:14:03.840 --> 0:14:06.840 between all of the parts instead of Wi-Fi. 0:14:06.840 --> 0:14:12.240 And what about grounding equipment? So I've been spending lots of time with speaker wire 0:14:12.240 --> 0:14:17.200 and taking the prongs out of plugs and wrapping them around and plugging them into grounds. 0:14:17.200 --> 0:14:20.520 You think, so I have a bunch of equipment on the desk right now. Should I try or should 0:14:20.520 --> 0:14:27.200 a person try to ground everything metal in their environment? Check if you have a field meter. 0:14:27.200 --> 0:14:31.480 Check whether your monitor is putting out a big field. 0:14:33.120 --> 0:14:38.120 My Macintosh monitor had a huge field 0:14:38.120 --> 0:14:42.320 and was very hot, so I just bought a different monitor. 0:14:42.320 --> 0:14:48.560 I have a grounding pad, but it didn't affect the Macintosh 0:14:48.560 --> 0:14:50.920 monitor enough to bother with. 0:14:50.920 --> 0:14:55.880 What's the more effective strategy, grounding every item and yourself, or is it more important 0:14:55.880 --> 0:14:58.480 for yourself to be grounded, or what? 0:14:58.480 --> 0:15:07.000 Only if it has big fields you're sure is reaching out two or three feet beyond the monitor or your keyboard. 0:15:07.000 --> 0:15:15.340 But when you have things connected by the wires, your general environment is much reduced. 0:15:15.340 --> 0:15:19.200 And then similar question, you mentioned maybe, I don't know, four or five years ago about 0:15:19.200 --> 0:15:23.600 grounding a person's bed. Can you maybe explain that a little bit more if you think that's 0:15:23.600 --> 0:15:29.600 something important? Probably going barefoot in Mexico the temperatures is 0:15:29.600 --> 0:15:37.640 good enough that you can walk barefoot outside anytime you feel like it. And 0:15:37.640 --> 0:15:43.960 even in town people are gonna look at you if you walk barefoot down the 0:15:43.960 --> 0:15:45.920 sidewalk but there's no law against 0:15:45.920 --> 0:15:52.760 it. And the daytime contact with the earth, I think, is enough to get you through the 0:15:52.760 --> 0:16:00.960 night without grounding. But you can get sheets and bedding that have copper wires woven into 0:16:00.960 --> 0:16:08.200 the fabric and a connection to put a wire to ground. And theoretically, that 0:16:08.200 --> 0:16:15.640 protects you considerably from the, if you have 60 cycle or 50 cycle electricity in your 0:16:15.640 --> 0:16:16.640 environment. 0:16:16.640 --> 0:16:20.740 And what's like the bioenergetic perspective of being grounded? Like what, what exactly 0:16:20.740 --> 0:16:27.880 does that even do? They talk about it as a sort of a buffer 0:16:28.520 --> 0:16:33.520 to the electrons that are being produced metabolically. 0:16:33.960 --> 0:16:37.240 And if you take a piece of skin, 0:16:37.240 --> 0:16:40.160 people vary according to their metabolic rate 0:16:40.160 --> 0:16:41.200 and thyroid function, 0:16:41.200 --> 0:16:46.160 but you can put a piece of skin in the culture dish and it will keep 0:16:46.160 --> 0:16:52.000 projecting a static field into the surrounding space. 0:16:52.000 --> 0:16:57.920 If you put cyanide in the culture dish, stopping respiration, the electrical field collapses 0:16:57.920 --> 0:17:08.280 and washing the cyanide out, the field comes back. And so people are in effect bristling with their own, it's 0:17:08.280 --> 0:17:18.700 like a static field, an electret is what you call it when it's established in wax or plastic. 0:17:18.700 --> 0:17:29.580 For a long time they had electret needles for phonograph pickups and instead of electromagnetic, it was a piece 0:17:29.580 --> 0:17:37.680 of ceramic or plastic that had a static electrical field implanted in the plastic or ceramic 0:17:37.680 --> 0:17:47.560 as it was hardening and that polarized system of electrons projects the field permanently so that if you vibrate that 0:17:47.560 --> 0:17:51.320 piece of plastic, it creates an electrical current. 0:17:51.320 --> 0:17:55.920 So it's just a variation on electromagnetic pickups. 0:17:55.920 --> 0:18:08.720 But it's a very powerful phenomenon that if you're handling plastic bottles, for example, sometimes it will mess up the ability 0:18:08.720 --> 0:18:13.520 to control the fluid that you want to get out of the bottle because the plastic has 0:18:13.520 --> 0:18:16.560 such a strong electrical field built into it. 0:18:16.560 --> 0:18:26.360 And we are being a soft, flexible material. material, we have to generate that structure and field momentarily by 0:18:26.360 --> 0:18:36.040 respiring, and that in an isolated environment that could lead to influences 0:18:36.040 --> 0:18:42.000 backwards from our environment to our metabolism. And supposedly if you ground 0:18:42.000 --> 0:18:47.360 yourself, that keeps the extraneous charges from interfering 0:18:47.360 --> 0:18:52.680 with your own biological generation of that electret-like static field. 0:18:52.680 --> 0:18:53.680 Very interesting. 0:18:53.680 --> 0:18:58.560 So instead of grounding yourself, wouldn't taking a hefty dosage of quinones like methylene 0:18:58.560 --> 0:19:01.400 blue or vitamin K would have a similar effect? 0:19:01.400 --> 0:19:06.300 That keeps you oxidizing it. That's protective internally, 0:19:06.300 --> 0:19:10.960 but the grounding people emphasize that it's protective, 0:19:10.960 --> 0:19:13.200 at least in some circumstances, 0:19:13.200 --> 0:19:17.000 to make sure you aren't being surrounded 0:19:17.000 --> 0:19:20.240 by the wrong kind of electrical charge. 0:19:20.240 --> 0:19:22.720 Oh, this is from like, if you're submerged 0:19:22.720 --> 0:19:24.840 in a static field because of electric devices 0:19:24.840 --> 0:19:25.300 or things like that 0:19:25.300 --> 0:19:27.500 That's that that's what the grounding protects from 0:19:27.500 --> 0:19:28.000 Yeah 0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:31.840 That was my next question because I I forgot what the experiment was but somebody on YouTube 0:19:31.920 --> 0:19:33.920 Showed that when they were grounded 0:19:33.920 --> 0:19:38.700 I can't remember how they did this but they showed that the EMF was less intense or something that and that 0:19:38.800 --> 0:19:42.040 Made me more interested in it after hearing that. Yeah, I 0:19:43.120 --> 0:19:47.600 repeated those experiments and You can see the change. 0:19:47.600 --> 0:19:52.600 Your body, when I was doing electrical stimulation 0:19:52.840 --> 0:19:56.600 experiments, I tried to set up things to detect 0:19:56.600 --> 0:20:01.080 the internal electrical behavior of tissues and organisms, 0:20:01.080 --> 0:20:07.760 but I found that putting a strong detector on my animal or my tissue 0:20:07.760 --> 0:20:17.200 or myself, we got the rock music radio station. No matter what tissue we were 0:20:17.200 --> 0:20:27.000 trying to examine, the radio station was so powerful it it was swamping all of the intrinsic biological signals. 0:20:27.000 --> 0:20:31.520 That's like a low-level EMF device that you were using, right? 0:20:31.520 --> 0:20:32.520 Yeah. 0:20:32.520 --> 0:20:34.640 Yeah, so it's probably way worse now. 0:20:34.640 --> 0:20:35.640 Yeah. 0:20:35.640 --> 0:20:48.920 Before I ever supplemented thyroid, I think it was 1976 that I first decided to go ahead with my intuition because before that, I knew that 0:20:48.920 --> 0:20:56.160 I had the hypothyroid signs, the classical things except that my metabolic rate was very 0:20:56.160 --> 0:20:57.160 high. 0:20:57.160 --> 0:21:07.040 Just at rest, I was burning about 4,000 calories and in a BMR test, I was two or three hundred percent above normal 0:21:07.040 --> 0:21:13.400 oxygen consumption and that delayed me for several years from believing that I could 0:21:13.400 --> 0:21:14.400 be hypothyroid. 0:21:14.400 --> 0:21:27.680 But anyway, when I took thyroid, suddenly my metabolic energy went down towards normal but in the few years before I took thyroid, being around lab 0:21:27.680 --> 0:21:33.640 instruments of various sorts, I was able to see that that high internal 0:21:33.640 --> 0:21:39.640 metabolism was causing me to have extremely exaggerated projection of 0:21:39.640 --> 0:21:46.300 charge fields around me. So that in lab where we had to use an electronic 0:21:46.300 --> 0:21:53.900 stimulator to produce a certain voltage to stimulate cells, if I reached towards 0:21:53.900 --> 0:22:00.420 it, got within the foot of it to adjust a knob, the machine would just suddenly run 0:22:00.420 --> 0:22:06.120 off scale and go full force and as I pulled my hand away, it would go back 0:22:06.120 --> 0:22:12.240 sort of like the theremin music instrument that you adjust the pitch 0:22:12.240 --> 0:22:18.080 according to your position of your hand. But I had to always have my lab partner 0:22:18.080 --> 0:22:28.880 operate the machine because my hand made it malfunction and anything electrical tended to be disturbed. Even a 0:22:29.840 --> 0:22:38.320 cosmic ray cloud chamber, the ionization behavior of the humid atmosphere was cleared up 0:22:39.440 --> 0:22:45.280 by this field that extended about a foot to a foot and a half beyond my body. 0:22:45.280 --> 0:22:49.900 So the people who basically tend to get shocked very often for no apparent reason, is it fair 0:22:49.900 --> 0:22:54.820 to say that they have very high rate of metabolism but the electrons are not getting paired properly 0:22:54.820 --> 0:22:57.880 with oxygen so they build up and they sort of create this field? 0:22:57.880 --> 0:22:59.100 Yeah, I think so. 0:22:59.100 --> 0:23:04.280 So when you are taking thyroid, what happened, I mean I guess it lowered your stress hormones 0:23:04.280 --> 0:23:06.620 so your metabolic rate went down? 0:23:06.620 --> 0:23:14.580 Yeah, I've seen it in three or four other men about the same age and they're 30s usually 0:23:14.580 --> 0:23:19.060 who no matter how much they ate couldn't put on weight. 0:23:19.060 --> 0:23:27.520 They would often be 120 or 30 pounds for a standard height but if they took thyroid, suddenly their ability 0:23:27.520 --> 0:23:34.320 to build muscle and fat with a normal amount of food was restored. 0:23:34.320 --> 0:23:41.560 When you're hypothyroid, I think the mechanism is that your cells lose the ability to constantly 0:23:41.560 --> 0:23:48.120 retain magnesium and so if the cells lose magnesium chronically, 0:23:48.120 --> 0:23:56.800 they run their energy apparatus to the magnesium allows the ATP to accumulate and if you can't 0:23:56.800 --> 0:24:09.800 accumulate the ATP, you have to make it constantly and the thyroid supplement I think is letting you retain the necessary magnesium to stabilize 0:24:09.800 --> 0:24:13.960 the ATP so you can turn off the production periodically. 0:24:13.960 --> 0:24:19.840 So these people basically have upper glycolysis to produce the necessary ATP through the less 0:24:19.840 --> 0:24:22.280 efficient means if thyroid is not available. 0:24:22.280 --> 0:24:26.760 Yeah and that's where the symptoms and deterioration come in. 0:24:26.760 --> 0:24:35.240 So it's very wasteful of food to have that happen but it keeps things working very nicely. 0:24:35.240 --> 0:24:38.320 What about the people who put on weight too easily? 0:24:38.320 --> 0:24:40.040 What's the explanation there? 0:24:40.040 --> 0:24:42.080 Again in terms of low thyroid or? 0:24:42.080 --> 0:24:46.280 Yeah, just low thyroid is not running the machine fast enough. 0:24:46.280 --> 0:24:51.080 Who do you say is in a worse position, a person who puts on weight easily or cannot put on 0:24:51.080 --> 0:24:53.120 weight no matter how much they eat? 0:24:53.120 --> 0:25:02.080 The people I've known, like myself, were very energetic and healthy, but they just couldn't 0:25:02.080 --> 0:25:04.120 put on weight no matter how much they eat. 0:25:04.120 --> 0:25:06.320 Okay, but this is still stress metabolism, right? 0:25:06.320 --> 0:25:09.920 Because thyroid wasn't functioning properly. 0:25:09.920 --> 0:25:14.920 Well, it was as long as it was able to use the energy 0:25:15.360 --> 0:25:18.100 and make ATP, it didn't have to resort 0:25:18.100 --> 0:25:21.040 to other sources to make ATP. 0:25:21.040 --> 0:25:28.680 So in those hypermetabolic states, there's not necessarily any glycolysis going on. 0:25:28.680 --> 0:25:34.000 And what was keeping your metabolic rate so high if thyroid wasn't optimal? 0:25:34.000 --> 0:25:50.040 I think a diet that was heavy on phosphate, not enough calcium and magnesium. People have experimented with the allergy patients found that the active thyroid hormone 0:25:50.040 --> 0:25:56.680 let you retain magnesium if you were given it but without the T3, you could put the magnesium 0:25:56.680 --> 0:26:11.760 in and they would work perfectly for a few days and then they would lose the magnesium. So taking a supplement of magnesium can temporarily moderate your metabolism so you don't have 0:26:11.760 --> 0:26:14.920 that hyper metabolic reaction to low thyroid. 0:26:14.920 --> 0:26:19.880 But you have to keep taking it over and over because you lose it quickly without the ATP? 0:26:19.880 --> 0:26:20.880 Yeah. 0:26:20.880 --> 0:26:28.000 The doctors experimenting on their patients found that just one or two intravenous doses 0:26:28.000 --> 0:26:37.800 was enough to work for a week, but then they could take it orally and keep their magnesium 0:26:37.800 --> 0:26:39.500 up and their allergies down. 0:26:39.500 --> 0:26:42.520 Maybe you mentioned a few years ago, with good thyroid function, you could even get, 0:26:42.520 --> 0:26:47.040 I don't know, what was it, like 200 milligrams of magnesium that would be sufficient like some people on the internet take like a 0:26:47.040 --> 0:26:53.840 thousand or two thousand milligrams every day? Yeah the body when it's deficient can suck up 0:26:53.840 --> 0:27:00.640 and retain a fairly modest amount from your food supply but if your thyroid is low then 0:27:01.280 --> 0:27:06.080 you have to worry about the constant supply of generous magnesium. 0:27:06.080 --> 0:27:10.720 So in keeping, thanks for that, in keeping with our anti-non-toxic, anti-inflammatory 0:27:10.720 --> 0:27:17.640 home, probably, I don't know, was it 2018, I emailed you about a home air purifier and 0:27:17.640 --> 0:27:21.920 you told me you had the Mystic Marvels device and so I immediately bought that and experimented 0:27:21.920 --> 0:27:26.480 with it. And so that's, one, like what is a negative ion generator and why is it useful? 0:27:26.480 --> 0:27:35.760 The majority of the careful studies have found that the serotonin disposition is increased 0:27:35.760 --> 0:27:48.220 immediately by negative ions in the air in particular because the lungs are the main, the liver does it but the lungs have the first 0:27:48.220 --> 0:27:55.760 access to the circulating platelets carrying serotonin produced by stress and irritation 0:27:55.760 --> 0:27:57.280 inflammation. 0:27:57.280 --> 0:28:07.080 So if your lungs need a boost of energy to detoxify that circulating stress-related serotonin. The electrons 0:28:07.080 --> 0:28:15.160 delivered on error ions participate directly in the monoamino oxidase 0:28:15.160 --> 0:28:21.720 reaction to eliminate it. And some of the studies show that the blood level of 0:28:21.720 --> 0:28:28.080 serotonin is decreased as you have more ionized negative air. 0:28:28.080 --> 0:28:31.920 So just having that around you, especially in the evening time, like maybe next to your 0:28:31.920 --> 0:28:36.200 bed would be a good way to not go extremely hypometabolic during the nighttime. 0:28:36.200 --> 0:28:37.200 Yeah. 0:28:37.200 --> 0:28:38.200 Amazing. 0:28:38.200 --> 0:28:39.200 Okay. 0:28:39.200 --> 0:28:48.320 I think very high altitude, the ultraviolet in the air is intense enough to give you a steady supply of negative ions. 0:28:48.320 --> 0:28:53.080 Why do you think, some people email me studies showing that there's an increased risk of 0:28:53.080 --> 0:28:54.080 suicide at altitude. 0:28:54.080 --> 0:28:57.040 What do you think is responsible for that? 0:28:57.040 --> 0:29:03.320 I looked at many of the countries around the world and that simply is a bad generalization. 0:29:03.320 --> 0:29:10.120 It probably has to do with social economic conditions in Colorado, which they were looking at. 0:29:10.120 --> 0:29:23.520 But when you look at Bangladesh and Tibet and Colombia and the low-lying Latin cultures, 0:29:23.520 --> 0:29:26.480 there's absolutely no correlation. 0:29:26.480 --> 0:29:29.760 In fact, the people living in the field have a much higher rate, right? 0:29:29.760 --> 0:29:37.600 Yeah, generally the health is worse as your altitude is lower. 0:29:38.880 --> 0:29:50.080 Every thousand feet of altitude where you live decreases heart disease, mortality, cancer, mortality, and 0:29:50.080 --> 0:29:51.080 dementia. 0:29:51.080 --> 0:29:56.440 You mentioned in some of your books about the extreme longevity in places like Azerbaijan 0:29:56.440 --> 0:29:59.640 and like the Caucasus Mountains. 0:29:59.640 --> 0:30:03.540 And there is this guy, I think his last name is Muslimov. 0:30:03.540 --> 0:30:06.240 He used to he lived in the former Soviet Union. 0:30:06.240 --> 0:30:12.640 He was an Azeri guy who had a passport showing that he was 160 some years old when he actually died. 0:30:12.640 --> 0:30:20.400 I mean the altitude there is high, but it's not that high. He lived at an altitude of about 1800 meters. 0:30:20.400 --> 0:30:25.260 So why, I mean, do you think there are studies that, have you seen studies that show that 0:30:25.260 --> 0:30:29.220 even higher altitude like in the Himalayas for example the Sherpas that live there at 0:30:29.220 --> 0:30:31.900 much higher altitude, are they living on average longer? 0:30:31.900 --> 0:30:38.500 All the figures I've seen show that cancer and heart disease are consistently lower the 0:30:38.500 --> 0:30:44.100 higher you live and osteoporosis is something very directly connected. 0:30:44.100 --> 0:30:47.000 Your bones get stronger and teeth stay in longer. 0:30:47.000 --> 0:30:49.880 So the altitude, I guess, is half of it and the other half is diet, 0:30:49.880 --> 0:30:53.840 because that guy who lived to 168 ate mostly milk and a little bit of bread. 0:30:53.840 --> 0:31:00.720 Yeah, that area, the dairy area, they got plenty of milk and cheese. 0:31:00.720 --> 0:31:04.120 Yeah, he got married at the age of 140 and had children, apparently. 0:31:04.880 --> 0:31:05.000 Azerbaijan is, you've mentioned them frequently, right? Yeah, he got married at the age of 140 and had children, apparently. 0:31:05.000 --> 0:31:07.840 Azerbaijan is, you've mentioned them frequently, right? 0:31:07.840 --> 0:31:10.640 They have, like, kind of the foods you recommend, isn't that right? 0:31:10.640 --> 0:31:11.640 Like, historically? 0:31:11.640 --> 0:31:13.640 Yeah, I've seen pictures of their meals. 0:31:13.640 --> 0:31:16.000 They look very delicious. 0:31:16.000 --> 0:31:18.000 Did you go there when you visited the Soviet Union? 0:31:18.000 --> 0:31:19.000 No. 0:31:19.000 --> 0:31:20.000 Amazing. 0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:21.000 Okay, we'll give Ray a break here. 0:31:21.000 --> 0:31:22.000 Let me do a little advertisement. 0:31:22.000 --> 0:31:23.560 So the newsletter is available by email now. 0:31:23.560 --> 0:31:25.900 It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal 0:31:25.900 --> 0:31:27.540 to raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com. 0:31:27.540 --> 0:31:29.200 And Ray, if I heard you correctly, 0:31:29.200 --> 0:31:31.320 you switch to how many times a month? 0:31:31.320 --> 0:31:32.940 Four, I'm sorry, how many times a year? 0:31:32.940 --> 0:31:33.900 Four times? 0:31:33.900 --> 0:31:36.620 Four times a year, more or less quarterly. 0:31:36.620 --> 0:31:41.420 So instead of a two-year subscription 0:31:41.420 --> 0:31:47.880 with 12 issues total, it's now three years for $30 or one year for 0:31:47.880 --> 0:31:52.400 $10 for four issues. I should address this. That's amazing. I don't know 0:31:52.400 --> 0:31:56.600 how you kept up with the two month schedule. I think I would have quit doing that after 0:31:56.600 --> 0:32:02.320 maybe, I don't know, a month or two. It's really amazing. For the first 20 years I was doing it 0:32:02.320 --> 0:32:08.200 every month. Then the next 20, 21 years I did it every other month. 0:32:08.200 --> 0:32:12.640 But part of the thing was that a bimonthly subscription, 0:32:12.640 --> 0:32:15.840 people were confused and thought their subscription 0:32:15.840 --> 0:32:19.360 was for one year because it was 12 issues 0:32:19.360 --> 0:32:21.520 or didn't know what bimonthly meant. 0:32:21.520 --> 0:32:23.760 And so they were constantly causing 0:32:24.680 --> 0:32:26.480 email questioning 0:32:26.480 --> 0:32:32.980 that too much time. I just lost it it was $30 for three years what was it? No $10 0:32:32.980 --> 0:32:41.060 per year. Okay. So for the 12 issues that used to be $28 and now it comes to $30. 0:32:41.060 --> 0:32:44.960 Okay got it okay got it. Okay and then also you can get your amazing books 0:32:44.960 --> 0:32:47.240 Generative Energy from PMS to Menopause, 0:32:47.240 --> 0:32:51.120 Mind and Tissue, and Nutrition for Women by emailing raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com. 0:32:51.120 --> 0:32:55.480 And you can get them in digital and some of them are available in paperback, correct? 0:32:55.480 --> 0:32:57.360 Ray Peats Yeah, several are still available. 0:32:57.360 --> 0:32:59.680 Ryan Clements And then Progest-E from Keenogen, you can 0:32:59.680 --> 0:33:02.880 email Catherine to purchase keenogen at gmail.com. 0:33:02.880 --> 0:33:06.100 And each bottle of Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone. 0:33:06.100 --> 0:33:08.480 I just purchased 30 bottles, so thank you. 0:33:08.480 --> 0:33:10.360 Ray, please tell Catherine I said thank you. 0:33:10.360 --> 0:33:11.880 And then my plan is to mix that 0:33:11.880 --> 0:33:14.000 with I purchased a lot of DHE from Bulk, 0:33:14.000 --> 0:33:15.680 I think it was bulkpowder.com, 0:33:15.680 --> 0:33:17.120 and I'll mix those together. 0:33:17.120 --> 0:33:21.000 But Ray, any recent progesterone stories that you have? 0:33:21.000 --> 0:33:21.960 No. 0:33:21.960 --> 0:33:24.120 Do we talk about cycling the last time you were on? 0:33:24.120 --> 0:33:26.600 How imperative that was for even 0:33:26.600 --> 0:33:27.600 somebody... 0:33:27.600 --> 0:33:35.000 For women, it's very important to the extent that their estrogen is still a problem, because 0:33:35.000 --> 0:33:42.080 even small amounts of estrogen, if it's continuous and not interrupted, are carcinogenic eventually. 0:33:42.080 --> 0:33:45.520 And so the cycling function of progesterone is to 0:33:45.520 --> 0:33:51.200 thoroughly knock out the estrogen influence and let the tissue gather 0:33:51.200 --> 0:33:58.440 itself together. It completely stops the estrogen cycle, carcinogenic cycle if 0:33:58.440 --> 0:34:08.000 you interrupt it properly but when you take progesterone steadily without the interruption, your liver interprets 0:34:08.000 --> 0:34:16.400 the constant high level of progesterone as being excessive and so anything your liver 0:34:16.400 --> 0:34:26.520 experiences at a high level, it produces enzymes to excrete and so after two weeks, your liver has built up excretory enzymes 0:34:26.520 --> 0:34:29.200 that inactivate the progesterone. 0:34:29.200 --> 0:34:36.840 And so after two weeks, the effect of a given dose of progesterone is weaker and stopping 0:34:36.840 --> 0:34:44.600 for at least a week lets your liver reset its threshold for excreting progesterone so 0:34:44.600 --> 0:34:46.200 you get more for your money. 0:34:46.200 --> 0:34:48.060 A couple of questions here. 0:34:48.060 --> 0:34:53.000 First of all, if progesterone being a catotoxic steroid, it increases the amount of cytochrome 0:34:53.000 --> 0:34:56.280 P450, the amount that is synthesized. 0:34:56.280 --> 0:34:59.760 Isn't that in general a very good thing because you're going to be able to detox quite a few 0:34:59.760 --> 0:35:03.560 other substances even though that will also detox the progesterone faster? 0:35:03.560 --> 0:35:07.240 Yeah, it does have a general cleaning up effect. 0:35:07.240 --> 0:35:14.880 Okay and then as far as the actual acceleration of the detox, wouldn't it be less of a problem 0:35:14.880 --> 0:35:21.080 if the person took it topically because the liver will get like, because it will avoid 0:35:21.080 --> 0:35:25.400 the first pass metabolism, the liver will have to deal with smaller amounts 0:35:25.400 --> 0:35:27.960 per unit of time, so it wouldn't upregulate it as much. 0:35:27.960 --> 0:35:31.440 It doesn't get it on the first pass anyway. 0:35:31.440 --> 0:35:33.800 That happens with some drugs. 0:35:33.800 --> 0:35:38.320 Progesterone and vitamin E being perfectly soluble 0:35:38.320 --> 0:35:43.320 in the chylomitrons bypasses the liver many passes 0:35:43.920 --> 0:35:48.600 until it is all distributed into your fat tissue, your 0:35:48.600 --> 0:35:54.520 brain and everywhere that takes it up. But the chitomitrons are privileged to pass through 0:35:54.520 --> 0:36:00.960 the liver without giving up their progesterone. So there's no first pass effect when you take 0:36:00.960 --> 0:36:03.360 a progesterone in vitamin E. 0:36:03.360 --> 0:36:07.280 And when you told the pharmaceutical rep that, he was not very happy to hear that? 0:36:07.280 --> 0:36:10.000 Because you're explaining your patent, right? 0:36:10.000 --> 0:36:13.680 The pharmaceutical rep came to your house and he was talking about purchasing it, maybe? 0:36:13.680 --> 0:36:16.680 That was DHEA, actually. 0:36:16.680 --> 0:36:24.440 And I told him examples of how it worked for three hours or so all afternoon. 0:36:24.440 --> 0:36:26.880 And he said, that's all very interesting, 0:36:26.880 --> 0:36:28.480 but that's not a good drug. 0:36:29.800 --> 0:36:30.640 I didn't know this. 0:36:30.640 --> 0:36:33.040 You had the DHA was dissolved in the vitamin E 0:36:33.040 --> 0:36:34.520 and that's, so that's something you had. 0:36:34.520 --> 0:36:35.840 I thought they were always mixed together 0:36:35.840 --> 0:36:36.960 that you were giving me. 0:36:36.960 --> 0:36:39.280 No, it was a second patent two years later. 0:36:39.280 --> 0:36:40.120 Oh, interesting. 0:36:40.120 --> 0:36:41.680 I think it's a testosterone, DHA, 0:36:41.680 --> 0:36:43.280 and progesterone and pregnenolone, right? 0:36:43.280 --> 0:36:47.480 I noticed they were separate. DHEA was a separate patent. 0:36:47.480 --> 0:36:51.960 Oh, because I think I saw something about testosterone in vitamin E from you. 0:36:51.960 --> 0:36:59.640 Yeah, I used to distribute that especially for arthritis in either men or women and I 0:36:59.640 --> 0:37:06.360 wanted it so I didn't have to mix it special for each one so I put a functional amount of all 0:37:06.360 --> 0:37:13.440 of them so there wouldn't be far out of balance for either men or women and applying it topically 0:37:13.440 --> 0:37:17.320 or orally it was extremely effective for knocking out arthritis. 0:37:17.320 --> 0:37:19.480 Rick Was testosterone not a controlled substance 0:37:19.480 --> 0:37:20.480 back in the day? 0:37:20.480 --> 0:37:25.720 I mean did FDA clamp down like like, started really regulating it recently? 0:37:25.720 --> 0:37:27.720 Yeah, they got worse and worse. 0:37:27.720 --> 0:37:32.060 Wow. Speaking of vitamin E, I've been meaning to ask you this for like 10 episodes now, 0:37:32.060 --> 0:37:50.760 but what is the vitamin K itself and things I extracted from 0:37:50.760 --> 0:37:59.800 liver and various quinones and putting them together, they formed a blackish-green, apparently 0:37:59.800 --> 0:38:08.320 an oxidation process but putting dark blackish-green oil onto a paper chromatograph as the 0:38:08.320 --> 0:38:15.080 solvent moves up to paper, it separated them back into the normal vitamin K and vitamin 0:38:15.080 --> 0:38:22.880 E colors showing there was only a charge transfer but that in the body if you have a charge 0:38:22.880 --> 0:38:25.820 transfer circulating in your blood that 0:38:25.820 --> 0:38:30.920 becomes extremely sensitive to environmental light effects. So if a 0:38:30.920 --> 0:38:33.760 person's gonna take vitamin K or vitamin E they should take them away from each 0:38:33.760 --> 0:38:38.840 other right? Yeah, somewhat. Or not get exposed to bright sunlight or light for 0:38:38.840 --> 0:38:45.120 the next few hours. Is riboflavin also subject to the same restriction of vitamin B2? 0:38:45.120 --> 0:38:48.120 Oh, it's anything. 0:38:48.120 --> 0:38:56.040 Blue light or ultraviolet will destroy riboflavin and cause mutations and inflammation in your 0:38:56.040 --> 0:38:57.680 tissues where it happens. 0:38:57.680 --> 0:39:01.960 If you take a lot of riboflavin, you want to stay out of the sun for a while. 0:39:01.960 --> 0:39:09.560 Have you seen the patents Pfizer filed on, they call called photodynamic therapy with methylene blue and red light? Yeah but 0:39:09.560 --> 0:39:14.880 that's to kill viruses basically. They also claim, I mean they patented 0:39:14.880 --> 0:39:18.480 specifically for cancer, they're saying instead of giving you toxic drugs that 0:39:18.480 --> 0:39:22.400 increase reactive oxygen species, we're just going to give you methylene blue and 0:39:22.400 --> 0:39:28.160 then irradiate you and that will achieve the same reactive oxygen species generation which I think is dangerous, right? 0:39:28.160 --> 0:39:32.560 Yeah, it's the same as most chemotherapies. 0:39:32.560 --> 0:39:40.520 They hope it's more specific to the cancer than to your brain cells but it always kills 0:39:40.520 --> 0:39:42.160 a lot of your brain cells. 0:39:42.160 --> 0:39:45.920 If someone were in this day and age, especially the COVID, if they're really afraid of the 0:39:45.920 --> 0:39:50.680 virus and they think they have it, would like a controlled version of this, let's say just 0:39:50.680 --> 0:39:55.080 a few milligrams of methylene blue and some red light, would that be a good therapy, antiviral 0:39:55.080 --> 0:39:56.080 therapy? 0:39:56.080 --> 0:40:01.880 Only good in the sense that it's less toxic than some other things, but I wouldn't recommend 0:40:01.880 --> 0:40:02.880 it. 0:40:02.880 --> 0:40:04.480 What about for things like disinfecting water? 0:40:04.480 --> 0:40:07.200 Put some methylene blue and then irradiate with red light. 0:40:07.200 --> 0:40:08.040 Would that work? 0:40:08.040 --> 0:40:12.320 It probably would leave some residues in the water 0:40:12.320 --> 0:40:13.800 that would be unpredictable. 0:40:13.800 --> 0:40:14.640 Okay. 0:40:14.640 --> 0:40:16.640 Last thing about the negative ion generator, 0:40:16.640 --> 0:40:19.600 because that dude, the Mystic Marvels guy, 0:40:19.600 --> 0:40:20.860 he doesn't sell them anymore. 0:40:20.860 --> 0:40:23.440 And so a buddy of mine sent him an email 0:40:23.440 --> 0:40:32.540 and he recommended the W E I N Wayne wine V 2500 high density ionic air purifier. Do you have any opinion on that? Have you ever heard of it before? 0:40:32.720 --> 0:40:40.240 No, but I would trust that guy. Yeah. No, what he's talking about. Yeah. So he stopped making it. He said it was just too much work. 0:40:40.260 --> 0:40:47.440 Didn't he also say people were buying them near the coast and I was breaking them and And so they would make it and then it would they break and then they'd want to return 0:40:47.440 --> 0:40:48.440 them or something. 0:40:48.440 --> 0:40:52.140 But yeah, so this is the one he recommended for anybody that's interested. 0:40:52.140 --> 0:40:55.560 And then again, we're really hopping around here. 0:40:55.560 --> 0:40:59.900 But a lot of people are, myself included, are confused about the variants. 0:40:59.900 --> 0:41:04.240 And so I remember the thing I remember that David E. Martin said was the variants you 0:41:04.240 --> 0:41:09.440 could like take the sequence of the coronavirus and just cut it off at different places and 0:41:09.440 --> 0:41:11.520 boom you have a new variant. 0:41:11.520 --> 0:41:12.520 What is actually going on here? 0:41:12.520 --> 0:41:15.720 It's like obviously they're not just perfectly fine. 0:41:15.720 --> 0:41:23.400 The CDC just recently told the FDA that it could discontinue the use of PCR because it's 0:41:23.400 --> 0:41:25.780 meaningless. discontinue the use of PCR because it's meaningless but the people who have been 0:41:25.780 --> 0:41:32.280 promoting it either were completely ignorant about what a PCR is. In fact, a 0:41:32.280 --> 0:41:41.100 lot of supposedly confident people were. When you use it to identify RNA 0:41:41.100 --> 0:41:46.960 such as coronavirus, you have to make DNA from the RNA before you can run 0:41:46.960 --> 0:41:57.360 the PCR using the DNA replicase or polymerase. And so the full name for the method is reverse 0:41:57.360 --> 0:42:06.880 transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. But for some reason, some people were calling it real-time PCR. 0:42:06.880 --> 0:42:12.080 They thought it sounded like it was more effective or something, neglecting that 0:42:12.080 --> 0:42:19.140 the RT refers to reverse transcriptase, which is an essential part of the 0:42:19.140 --> 0:42:30.840 process. And almost no one advocating the test has any idea what goes on in multiplying the DNA 0:42:30.840 --> 0:42:33.200 that you make from the RNA. 0:42:33.200 --> 0:42:49.680 And it's a manufacturing process that depends on the particular little stretch of DNA that you choose to amplify and you choose a stretch of the DNA out of 0:42:49.680 --> 0:42:52.920 whatever RNA you might have started with. 0:42:52.920 --> 0:42:59.240 And so you have to trust that the RNA sample was actually meaningfully connected to the 0:42:59.240 --> 0:43:11.280 virus, not to say anything about connected to the disease but connected to the virus and then that you chose a sequence to multiply and that in the process of 0:43:11.280 --> 0:43:17.940 increasing the amount of RNA of that particular a bit of specimen that you 0:43:17.940 --> 0:43:25.880 were actually replicating that DNA and not some random background material. 0:43:25.880 --> 0:43:34.880 But they generally ran at 40 cycles where everyone recognized that beyond 25 cycles, 0:43:34.880 --> 0:43:38.480 you were getting so many false positives, it was meaningless. 0:43:38.480 --> 0:43:48.440 So there's nothing about the PCR test that has been used honestly, and it has very consistently been used fraudulently, 0:43:48.440 --> 0:43:51.960 deliberately, by the government agencies 0:43:51.960 --> 0:43:54.200 and a lot of their apologists. 0:43:54.200 --> 0:43:56.740 But they, I mean, obviously Omicron and Delta, 0:43:56.740 --> 0:43:58.840 these are just media, marketing campaigns. 0:43:58.840 --> 0:44:00.320 Like these have, they can just create 0:44:00.320 --> 0:44:02.760 an endless amount of variants 0:44:02.760 --> 0:44:05.060 and then put them through the channels of marketing, right? 0:44:05.060 --> 0:44:05.900 Right. Yeah. 0:44:05.900 --> 0:44:08.720 Well, at what point a mutation creates a totally new, 0:44:08.720 --> 0:44:10.120 what should I call it, family of viruses? 0:44:10.120 --> 0:44:12.160 Can the coronavirus mutate to the point 0:44:12.160 --> 0:44:14.740 where it becomes a completely different type, 0:44:14.740 --> 0:44:16.020 like species of a virus? 0:44:16.020 --> 0:44:17.800 It's no longer a coronavirus, 0:44:17.800 --> 0:44:20.740 but let's say a rhinovirus or any other RNA virus? 0:44:20.740 --> 0:44:28.340 Very unlikely, even under lab circumstances, it's hardly possible. 0:44:28.340 --> 0:44:32.280 So many radical changes have to be done. 0:44:32.280 --> 0:44:36.400 So wouldn't this mutation game eventually sort of like get exhausted? 0:44:36.400 --> 0:44:40.640 Isn't that why we're starting to see this, now they're starting to hype up the avian 0:44:40.640 --> 0:44:52.220 viruses, the swine flu again is propping up, maybe they're running out of options. The normal evolution of the virus is to get weaker and weaker and weaker, so it 0:44:52.220 --> 0:44:58.700 has a better chance of surviving if it doesn't kill its host prematurely. And to 0:44:58.700 --> 0:45:07.280 the extent that there is some knowledge about the Omicron version. It's very harmless, like a mild cold. 0:45:07.280 --> 0:45:10.720 I heard you could get a myocarditis from the Omicron variant. 0:45:10.720 --> 0:45:11.720 Is that true? 0:45:11.720 --> 0:45:16.880 Yeah, you can get it from any virus. 0:45:16.880 --> 0:45:22.120 Everything that they accuse the coronavirus of causing from these long COVID, like a heart 0:45:22.120 --> 0:45:24.040 damage, lung damage, et cetera. 0:45:24.040 --> 0:45:26.000 If you Google that with influenza, 0:45:26.000 --> 0:45:27.600 you'll get at least 10 studies saying 0:45:27.600 --> 0:45:29.440 that flu can cause it as well. 0:45:29.440 --> 0:45:33.760 Yeah, I think long COVID is as questionable as short COVID. 0:45:33.760 --> 0:45:37.540 Well, one last thing and then we can go into questions, 0:45:37.540 --> 0:45:39.920 but medical nemesis Ivan Illich, 0:45:39.920 --> 0:45:41.680 he says, modern medicine is a negation of health. 0:45:41.680 --> 0:45:43.560 It isn't organized to serve human health, 0:45:43.560 --> 0:45:47.000 but only itself as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals. And this quote 0:45:47.000 --> 0:45:51.840 was fresh in my mind after arguing with this guy, because arguing that English guy, arguing 0:45:51.840 --> 0:45:56.260 the details with him was completely worthless, because if he didn't accept the foundation 0:45:56.260 --> 0:46:00.960 that medical intervention was a long history of unscientific practices, we would never 0:46:00.960 --> 0:46:10.240 get anywhere with talking about the details of anything. And so that, and again, all your work exemplifies that that is the big problem that these people have no, 0:46:10.240 --> 0:46:13.840 maybe they do know what they're doing, but they're doing things in harmful ways to hurt people. 0:46:13.840 --> 0:46:18.320 RKLMN Yeah, I've done some newsletters talking about the 0:46:19.120 --> 0:46:25.000 events in American medicine in particular, starting around 1850, 0:46:25.080 --> 0:46:28.160 when the American Medical Association 0:46:28.160 --> 0:46:30.320 decided to take over the world. 0:46:31.680 --> 0:46:36.680 They really were a very hostile group that wanted to, 0:46:38.200 --> 0:46:41.880 racially, they saw herbalists 0:46:41.880 --> 0:46:49.360 and other theories of healing, they saw them as inferior people. 0:46:49.360 --> 0:46:58.440 Native Americans had some very effective techniques, but they connected it to racism. 0:46:58.440 --> 0:47:08.760 Black people were excluded, and the practical medicine, a lot of it that had been brought from Africa, that was excluded. 0:47:08.760 --> 0:47:17.760 And what was left was what has been called allopathic medicine, the use of a single chemical 0:47:17.760 --> 0:47:27.920 to treat a single defined disease. defined disease and so it created an essentialist rather than an 0:47:27.920 --> 0:47:34.800 environmentalist approach to disease and the treatment of it became a very 0:47:34.800 --> 0:47:42.200 controllable one remedy for one disease and only the doctors were qualified to 0:47:42.200 --> 0:47:47.160 name the disease and therefore to prescribe the one specific 0:47:47.160 --> 0:47:49.240 chemical that would treat it. 0:47:49.240 --> 0:47:53.920 A totally fraudulent, anti-scientific view from the ground up. 0:47:53.920 --> 0:47:58.040 And the cures are worse than the disease, the burn, cut, poison strategies. 0:47:58.040 --> 0:48:06.400 Yeah, and all that comes from the same essentialist thing that cancer is essentially not human material. 0:48:06.400 --> 0:48:12.500 And all that can be done, because it has essentially changed its nature, is to kill it. 0:48:12.500 --> 0:48:26.440 So the whole concept is to kill it, not to heal the person who happens to be producing that tumor. Sorry, go ahead. Just to refresh my memory of the centralism, 0:48:26.480 --> 0:48:29.800 but that's like a immutable traits that can't change. Is that what that is? 0:48:30.440 --> 0:48:35.800 Yeah, that a gene is immortal, that our properties, 0:48:35.840 --> 0:48:40.640 our qualities are immortal, and they consist of the immortal genes. 0:48:41.440 --> 0:48:49.760 Separate, something absolutely separate from our somatic cells, the germline, they created 0:48:49.760 --> 0:48:57.120 an imaginary embryological history of developing the gonads. 0:48:57.120 --> 0:49:07.960 They claimed to see something that can't be seen under the microscope, and until about the year 2000, biologists just absolutely 0:49:07.960 --> 0:49:19.160 had complete faith in that cluster of assertions about immutability of traits, the Gregor Mendel 0:49:19.160 --> 0:49:29.040 theory of inheritance, which was essentially designed to counter Darwin and Lamarck and 0:49:29.040 --> 0:49:35.340 evolutionary thinking. Nothing evolves if you have eternal parts that are constantly 0:49:35.340 --> 0:49:36.840 coming back in different proportions. 0:49:36.840 --> 0:49:41.400 Thank you for that. We won't keep you too much longer, Ray. So just to do some Q&As 0:49:41.400 --> 0:49:45.560 and Georgie, interrupt at any time. Okay, so our first question here is, 0:49:45.560 --> 0:49:48.080 can you ask Ray, what is an electron? 0:49:48.080 --> 0:49:49.040 What do they look like? 0:49:49.040 --> 0:49:50.080 What are they made of? 0:49:51.320 --> 0:49:56.320 That's something that a good chemistry professor 0:49:56.520 --> 0:50:00.400 or biologist might actually consider. 0:50:00.400 --> 0:50:08.720 But the physics establishment insists that it's a matter of a verbal set of 0:50:08.720 --> 0:50:18.360 definitions and they won't tolerate such questions as how to imagine in a 0:50:18.360 --> 0:50:26.560 realistic way what is an electron and what is it doing and how does it do it and what does resonance 0:50:26.560 --> 0:50:27.560 mean? 0:50:27.560 --> 0:50:39.360 They say resonance is a matter between an electron and a nucleus and if you absorb energy 0:50:39.360 --> 0:50:44.120 from the environment or give it back, it's a matter of changing the relation between 0:50:44.120 --> 0:50:45.880 the electron and the 0:50:45.880 --> 0:50:55.480 nucleus. They don't want to have any images of how the wave front of an electromagnetic 0:50:55.480 --> 0:51:08.700 field approaching the nucleus and the electron, what happens at that interaction. It's sort of an all-or-nothing. You have to 0:51:08.700 --> 0:51:13.380 accept your definition and not think very much about it because when you 0:51:13.380 --> 0:51:19.300 think about it and actually do experiments, you violate their essential 0:51:19.300 --> 0:51:31.760 definitions. For example, a German researcher, Helmut Schultz, I think his name was, put a laser beam horizontally 0:51:31.760 --> 0:51:40.320 through a thin crystal, inserted in the electron beam of an electron microscope, and an inert, 0:51:40.320 --> 0:51:46.760 I think aluminum oxide field for the electrons to hit, no film or phosphor. 0:51:46.760 --> 0:51:52.680 So the electrons hitting the field shouldn't have done anything visible. 0:51:52.680 --> 0:51:59.640 But the color of laser going perpendicular really through the crystal added a resonant 0:51:59.640 --> 0:52:07.680 frequency to supposedly a beam of pure electrons and an electron supposedly resonates 0:52:07.680 --> 0:52:14.000 only with reference to its nucleus but the beam coming through the crystal in 0:52:14.000 --> 0:52:21.840 this experiment broke up into blue spots on the inert target area, showing that 0:52:21.840 --> 0:52:28.680 the laser energy was being absorbed by the electron itself, not an atom 0:52:28.680 --> 0:52:36.960 electron system, but the electron itself hitting a target somehow released the energy that 0:52:36.960 --> 0:52:39.960 it had resonated with. 0:52:39.960 --> 0:52:48.560 That has been repeated, the experiment has been done different times and it represents something 0:52:48.560 --> 0:52:55.800 true about reality but it totally undermines the whole official physics doctrine about 0:52:55.800 --> 0:52:56.800 what an electron is. 0:52:56.800 --> 0:53:00.560 So is an electron essentially a standing wave in the neutrino sea? 0:53:00.560 --> 0:53:07.960 Yeah, yeah, it's whatever that means. Well, I mean, well, it's a wave, it's a wave object, 0:53:07.960 --> 0:53:12.880 if you if you can call it that. It's not a point like particle, which is what they call 0:53:12.880 --> 0:53:19.920 it. And the neutrino sea itself is... Is waves. Yeah, hard, hard to visualize. Great stuff. 0:53:19.920 --> 0:53:24.120 Thank you for that. Okay. Can you ask him if he has heard of Walter Kilner? And if so, 0:53:24.120 --> 0:53:29.220 what he thinks about his use of di-cyanin to observe the observe the human aura? 0:53:29.220 --> 0:53:30.740 I haven't heard of it. 0:53:30.740 --> 0:53:35.520 Can you comment on the aura? Is that just an extension of like field theory or these 0:53:35.520 --> 0:53:36.700 bioelectric fields around us? 0:53:36.700 --> 0:53:48.480 I suspect that people are actually seeing that field. At the time, I was having my very intense electrical fields. A psychic 0:53:48.480 --> 0:53:55.360 that I didn't know but was visiting, a roommate, told my roommate that I had a 0:53:55.360 --> 0:54:06.320 very weird aura. When she went through the room, she seemed to be cringing, like there was avoiding heat coming off me or something. 0:54:06.320 --> 0:54:09.760 That's what Aphrodite noticed. That's why you guys had such a good connection. 0:54:09.760 --> 0:54:10.760 Yeah. 0:54:10.760 --> 0:54:16.400 Could it be a projection of the hologram that the brain creates of reality as a model inside 0:54:16.400 --> 0:54:19.320 the organism? So it just extends just a little bit outside of the body. 0:54:19.320 --> 0:54:24.480 Yeah, yeah. I think other organisms can tune in and get the picture. 0:54:24.480 --> 0:54:26.800 Okay, what does Ray see in his mind 0:54:26.800 --> 0:54:28.200 when he thinks of the cell? 0:54:28.200 --> 0:54:32.120 A series of things, cells that I have seen. 0:54:32.120 --> 0:54:35.480 Well, like those new elaborate kind of digital images 0:54:35.480 --> 0:54:38.000 where they're all like, looks like something, 0:54:38.000 --> 0:54:39.360 somebody threw something against the wall 0:54:39.360 --> 0:54:40.520 and it's kind of like a spatter thing. 0:54:40.520 --> 0:54:41.840 Is that the image that you have? 0:54:41.840 --> 0:54:44.920 No, I think of them as little personalities. 0:54:44.920 --> 0:54:50.560 What, like, how do you explain the discrepancy of thinking of them as these round things 0:54:50.560 --> 0:54:54.600 and then those new photos of them being kind of these scatter things? Or are both of those 0:54:54.600 --> 0:54:55.920 incorrect interpretations? 0:54:55.920 --> 0:55:06.040 Yeah, each cell has its field and like Ortega-Gasset said of a person that I am, I am, my 0:55:06.040 --> 0:55:11.720 circumstance, the cell is in the same situation as a person 0:55:12.720 --> 0:55:18.480 itself and its circumstance are identical. So as soon as the 0:55:18.480 --> 0:55:21.880 circumstance changes, the cell is no longer what it was. 0:55:21.920 --> 0:55:24.600 Appreciate that, Georgie, interrupt anytime. Can Dr. Pete 0:55:24.600 --> 0:55:26.600 elaborate on a bioenergetic view 0:55:26.600 --> 0:55:29.080 of sex determination during embryonic development? 0:55:29.080 --> 0:55:30.920 Would the mother's hormonal environment 0:55:30.920 --> 0:55:32.480 play a big role in the process? 0:55:32.480 --> 0:55:34.960 Yeah, yeah, temperature, hormones, 0:55:34.960 --> 0:55:36.800 stress hormones in particular, 0:55:37.840 --> 0:55:42.840 in fish and reptiles and birds even, 0:55:42.920 --> 0:55:48.000 the temperature is very essential to developing the ratio. 0:55:48.000 --> 0:55:54.000 So it depends on temperature, right? Like alligators, when they lay eggs, if it's hot, it's mostly males? 0:55:54.000 --> 0:56:08.440 Yeah, and chickens, the same thing. Early in the season, I forget which way it is, but it's a balance that's beneficial to have lots of females relative 0:56:08.440 --> 0:56:12.680 to males when conditions are going to be optimal. 0:56:12.680 --> 0:56:17.840 Do you think the high ratio of females to males, do you think that's nature's essentially 0:56:17.840 --> 0:56:20.160 protective mechanism to the species? 0:56:20.160 --> 0:56:23.960 I mean, protecting the species from disappearing if the environment is not good, it's better 0:56:23.960 --> 0:56:25.600 to have more females than males, 0:56:25.600 --> 0:56:28.880 because one male can essentially ensure the continuation, 0:56:28.880 --> 0:56:31.140 but if you have equal amount or more males, 0:56:31.140 --> 0:56:32.880 it becomes more difficult to reproduce. 0:56:32.880 --> 0:56:34.480 Yeah, I think so. 0:56:34.480 --> 0:56:35.720 Okay, another one here. 0:56:35.720 --> 0:56:38.600 So as an extension, the recent statistics 0:56:38.600 --> 0:56:40.200 that we're seeing all over the world, 0:56:40.200 --> 0:56:42.240 that a lot more girls are being born, 0:56:42.240 --> 0:56:43.840 aside from endocrine disruptors 0:56:43.840 --> 0:56:45.200 that are known to be estrogenic, 0:56:45.200 --> 0:56:46.160 and that can cause it, 0:56:46.160 --> 0:56:48.320 could it also be a sign that the conditions 0:56:48.320 --> 0:56:50.040 are deteriorating in our environment 0:56:50.040 --> 0:56:53.280 and the human race basically is producing more women 0:56:53.280 --> 0:56:55.120 in order to have a higher chance of survival? 0:56:55.120 --> 0:56:56.600 That sounds very reasonable. 0:56:56.600 --> 0:56:57.440 You just reminded me of something. 0:56:57.440 --> 0:57:01.720 That IQ drop of kids that were born in 2020, 0:57:01.720 --> 0:57:04.120 is this gonna result in a profoundly stupid society 0:57:04.120 --> 0:57:05.600 in the next 10, 20 years? 0:57:12.400 --> 0:57:21.760 Yeah, there was a... Have you read Ernest Sternglass's books or articles? He studied the effects of radiation on miscarriages and the ratio of boys surviving and so on. And 0:57:27.120 --> 0:57:37.520 boys surviving and so on. And he shows that at the peak atmospheric contamination from the 1963 bomb competition, atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs, 18 years later, the academic 0:57:37.520 --> 0:57:49.440 scores of all sorts, the, what's the standard exam that high school... Anyway, the average score went down and the 0:57:49.440 --> 0:57:56.800 genetic people said that's because more poor people are taking the test. But he showed 0:57:56.800 --> 0:58:05.000 very clearly that looking at just the highest scoring portion of the population, 0:58:05.680 --> 0:58:08.000 that the greatest decrease, 0:58:08.960 --> 0:58:12.140 18 years after the radiation peak, 0:58:12.140 --> 0:58:15.920 the greatest decrease was in the highest scoring category. 0:58:15.920 --> 0:58:17.800 So it lowered the average, 0:58:17.800 --> 0:58:20.760 but it even more drastically knocked out 0:58:20.760 --> 0:58:25.000 the exceptionally competent kids of that age. 0:58:25.620 --> 0:58:28.180 You've read about the, they call it the Flynn effect, right? 0:58:28.180 --> 0:58:31.180 The rising IQ scores throughout most of the 20th century, 0:58:31.180 --> 0:58:33.020 then in the 90s, they plateaued, 0:58:33.020 --> 0:58:36.100 and after 2000, they've been steadily dropping. 0:58:36.100 --> 0:58:39.700 Yeah, even though some countries show lately 0:58:39.700 --> 0:58:44.300 that the ratio of the brain to the body weight and height 0:58:44.300 --> 0:58:46.440 has decreased in several countries. 0:58:46.440 --> 0:58:47.280 And that's not even- 0:58:47.280 --> 0:58:48.960 Were these developed countries or- 0:58:50.040 --> 0:58:52.040 Yeah, Germany was one of them. 0:58:52.040 --> 0:58:52.880 Oh, wow. 0:58:52.880 --> 0:58:56.160 Not even accounting for the indefinite mRNA vaccines 0:58:56.160 --> 0:58:57.440 these kids are gonna have to deal with. 0:58:57.440 --> 0:58:58.760 Okay, here's another one. 0:58:58.760 --> 0:59:00.480 Are Sheldrake's morphic fields 0:59:00.480 --> 0:59:02.960 and Vernadsky's noosphere the same thing? 0:59:02.960 --> 0:59:04.720 Yeah, they could be. 0:59:08.840 --> 0:59:31.000 fields and Vernadsky's noosphere the of the ending of the Second World War. 0:59:31.000 --> 0:59:40.000 He was surrounded by destruction and death, but he said he was confident that the world 0:59:40.000 --> 0:59:48.360 would find a way out of it by increasing its metabolic rate, accumulating carbon dioxide, warming things up, making brains 0:59:48.360 --> 0:59:52.960 get bigger, and making plants grow faster, everything working 0:59:52.960 --> 0:59:59.840 more intensely. And the noosphere idea is the basic 0:59:59.840 --> 1:00:04.040 thing that we're all headed in that direction, just because of 1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:05.680 the nature of the universe. 1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:10.880 Did Russian science incorporate, like, Vernadsky's geocosmic realism into their thinking? 1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:14.800 Yeah, a large part of the establishment did. 1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.240 Do you think he's—oh, sorry, go ahead. 1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:29.380 There were the dogmatic—I think of them as the Hegelian Marxists, the ones that thought the dialectic was some 1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:33.000 mysterious thing. 1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:51.520 But the average, intelligent, well-read Russian biologist and scientists in general have that sort of an emergence orientation that 1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:59.840 it's part of the Marxist meaning of the dialectic, but it goes with an optimistic view of what 1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:01.440 the cosmos is all about. 1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:02.440 Amazing. 1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:03.440 Thank you for that. 1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:04.440 Give me a second here. 1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:06.980 Okay. Ray has previously mentioned how our ruling class 1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:14.400 Damaged are in the 20th century and highlighted the creation of Rockefeller ghost art if a counterculture painting movement was to start today 1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:20.700 What themes styles or subjects would Ray like to see captured or communicated many? Thanks from Australia 1:01:20.700 --> 1:01:25.160 I I think a little bit of the realism of Franz 1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:37.160 Hals, the perceiving interesting things in people, anything that is a worthwhile insight 1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:45.000 about the nature of people and their interactions. Franz Hals was very confident at capturing such things. 1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:49.540 Yeah, but do you mention him in General of Energy in 1994? 1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.100 You said that, what do you like, 1:01:51.100 --> 1:01:53.300 it's like more alive, his paintings? 1:01:53.300 --> 1:01:55.680 They were not just like a static, boring view of the person, 1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:58.140 or they reflected something about their personality? 1:01:58.140 --> 1:02:02.340 Yeah, he could perceive intensely enough 1:02:02.340 --> 1:02:08.880 that he could capture instantaneous things that represented much more of 1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:13.680 the person than a photograph would have. His paintings are, you can easily see that when 1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:18.560 you're looking at his paintings. Okay. Okay, we'll wrap it up here very soon. Okay. Does 1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:23.440 Ray think starch is responsible for a change in personality towards war and conquer that has caused 1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.600 the atrocities since the beginning of agriculture? 1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:32.000 It goes with malnutrition. The high starch diets end up 1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.640 tending to be deficient in some of the essential nutrients. High phosphate, 1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:43.760 stress-inducing things that make people irritable and authoritarian. 1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.000 High serotonin outcome 1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:48.560 of the inflammatory diet. 1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.560 Great stuff, and Georgie, interrupt me at any point here. 1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:51.380 Just a few more here. 1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:53.840 Okay, what is the cost of getting drunk occasionally, 1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:57.080 like blackout, passed out in the front yard, naked, drunk? 1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:00.080 Like five times a year, not financially, 1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:02.640 but like on your health and longevity? 1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.740 I think it's very stressful to lose consciousness. 1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:09.300 Maybe you told somebody in email a long time ago that it like greatly depletes 1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:12.380 your liver glycogen and it would take multiple days to recover. 1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:14.180 That's that's my experience. 1:03:14.180 --> 1:03:18.460 Like drinking is never worth it because I'll feel so awful the next few days. 1:03:18.460 --> 1:03:22.080 And so it just affects some people more than others 1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:24.300 based on their ability to store liver glycogen, do you think? 1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:25.840 Yeah, I think so. 1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:31.080 Wouldn't taking a hefty dose of progesterone largely replicate the effects of getting drunk? 1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:38.360 It increases your ability to store glycogen so it doesn't have any long-term negative 1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:46.380 effects but when I accidentally overdose on it and the coordination of my hands and feet was 1:03:46.380 --> 1:03:51.400 impossible for a while. But when I deliberately took a very large amount 1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:59.760 because I had a bad migraine, I went with the euphoria, simply went to sleep in 1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:05.760 about two minutes and had no more headache. But when it comes on accidentally and you 1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:10.440 are hurt, you should be able to use your hands and feet. 1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:11.560 It's embarrassing. 1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.240 OK, let me see one more advertisement, then we'll close out the show here. 1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.880 OK, so you can purchase Ray's newsletter for $30 for 12 issues 1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:20.120 over three years, four times a year. 1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:22.320 You can purchase his book at a books at Ray Peat's 1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:25.200 by emailing Ray Peatsletter at gmail.com 1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:28.640 from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular medicine, gender of energy, 1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.320 money and tissue, nutrition for women. And then if you want to purchase progesterone, 1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:37.040 progestease, specifically from Ketogen, email katharine at ketogen at gmail.com. 1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:40.720 Each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone. And then Ray, again, 1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:45.120 people hate when I ask you to speculate, but what do you think we're in store for in 2022? 1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:53.840 I think the resistors are going to put up more and more resistance, but Bill Gates has already 1:04:53.840 --> 1:05:02.000 said that the people are working on a vaccine for the Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus, which is 1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.360 similar to the Ebola virus and kills up to 90% of the 1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:12.240 people that infects and he says that is likely to be the next epidemic and since 1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:19.200 they are about ready to have a vaccine for it I think he might be right as soon 1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:27.040 as a vaccine is able to come to market at a profit of half a trillion dollars, then we can have 1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.280 the Marburg epidemic. 1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:38.000 I think the resistance is gaining faster than the clever World Economic Forum schemers can 1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.640 dream up catastrophes to happen to us. 1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:46.980 But if this Warburg virus, if it's so deadly, just like Ebola, then it can't really be a pandemic 1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:48.920 because it's going to kill most of the host 1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:50.340 before it has a chance to spread, right? 1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:52.340 How would you have a pandemic with that? 1:05:53.420 --> 1:05:56.640 It's just scarier, and that's all that's needed 1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:01.020 is to have a vaccine that is going to save everyone, 1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:06.640 and all it has to do is kill a few dozen people that they didn't want anyway 1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:12.960 and then they can sell a trillion dollars worth of vaccines. It'll probably be much more easy to 1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:17.520 mandate because they'll be look this is truly deadly don't resist because COVID is nothing 1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:21.600 compared to this. Yeah. But you're saying they could actually release something harmful not like 1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:25.600 COVID being a mild type of thing, but this actually 1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:26.600 being harmful? 1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:32.640 Yeah, since so many people have caught on that don't want the vaccine and realize that 1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:40.440 the vaccine mortality goes up the first month after being vaccinated, higher than not receiving 1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:50.880 a vaccine, that awareness is getting out. And so they need something really to scare people, show people bleed 1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:56.200 bleeding out of their eyes and ears and a real horror show. 1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:59.920 Yeah, that would do it. And you so this second act, you think it 1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:02.440 was strategic in making it even more gruesome? 1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:05.600 Yeah, I think that's why they're interested in it. 1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:08.880 Okay, well, we have that look forward to in 2022. 1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:11.120 Very, very excited about that. 1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:12.400 Can't wait. 1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.600 Okay, Ray, I stay on the line. 1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.520 Guys, thank you so much for hanging out. 1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:17.120 Sincerely appreciate this year. 1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:20.480 Other than being a total horror show, I've had fun doing this podcast. 1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:22.960 And Georgie and Ray, you guys always make it really special. 1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:26.600 And these have been my anchor this year of doing these. 1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:28.600 I sincerely appreciate all the viewership. 1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:31.280 And you guys are just a great, great audience. 1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:32.680 And you guys always give positive feedback. 1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:33.800 And so I sincerely appreciate it. 1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:35.280 So Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much. 1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:36.480 And Ray, thank you so much. 1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:38.120 Just it's been really incredible. 1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:40.320 And I can't wait to continue to do it in 2022. 1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:42.640 So Ray, stay on the line and guys, have a safe weekend. 1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:45.600 We'll talk to you guys soon and have a good New Year's and peace out. 1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:45.960 22.

One. Okay, and we're live with Georgie Dinkov and Raymond Peat

and we're just catching up with Ray about Mexico and things

but, you know, last time we talked, Ray, I don't think the CDC had come out

and said that masks were basically useless. I don't think they had come out

and said that the PCR test was useless, and then this whole Russia-Ukraine thing

is there any way to synthesize this into something that makes sense, like, from your point of view?

Oh, there are so many undeniable things now that the CDC just has to recognize

some of them just to not seem totally crazy and crooked, but still, they're basically crazy and crooked

and the government policy on Ukraine is some weird combination of very crazy and very stupid

because they're alienating so much of the world which can perceive what is going on

with Russia being the peacemaker and the US being just aggressive to an insane degree.

Is that just a complete diversion? Like, it can't be a coincidence that they ended kind of the COVID-trod stuff

and then that started up immediately.

Yeah, I think it's connected.

But like, as a diversion to like, I mean, is there a purpose to it or is it a complete phony story?

Like, I have been reading that people in Russia, or maybe it was the Ukraine,

were like completely unworried by the whole situation.

It was just people in America that were getting all riled up.

Yeah, even the president of Ukraine in a phone conversation with Biden told him to calm down.

You can't tell a person with dementia to calm down. They're agitated all the time.

Okay, and then the ending of the masks, like the ending of the gaslighting of the people that have been saying this for two years.

Do you think that's to give way for a future – like, we talked last time about Marburg or something else.

Like, it's actually scary that they're ending this stuff because that means something worse this way comes maybe?

Yeah, I think they're hoping to create enough fear and excitement around the Ukraine,

provoking Russia into occupying the eastern part of the country, for example, so they have something more permanent to focus on.

So what do you –

The president of Croatia and the governments of Germany and France are questioning the rightness of the NATO policies.

Croatia says they won't join in if the US goes to war.

Does this fit in with the Great Reset stuff, or is this just an anomaly?

I just don't understand how this fits into any kind of greater picture other than it just being a diversion.

I think just being crazed people stirring up excitement, recognizing that war presidents always are powerful,

the people who get in line behind a war president.

Interesting. And do you think he'll be re-elected or something because of this?

Does that make his image better or something?

I would suppose that's what he has in mind.

Interesting, interesting. And then what do you make of Putin being a part of that World Economic Forum program for students that Klaus had?

Does that worry you at all about Putin's ability to be a good leader?

No, I don't know about that program.

I should have grabbed the name of it. Okay, move on.

Have you seen some of the – well, they may be fake news, but the Western media has made a big deal out of how Russia is also making the vaccine mandatory for many of its citizens.

Do you think there is any truth to that, or it's just trying to present Putin as being a good boy and part of the team?

I hadn't heard anything about the mandatory. I had heard only 30% or so were vaccinated there, and that there wasn't a big push to go farther.

Yeah, I don't think there's a big push. It's just the way Eastern Europe operates.

Basically, nobody trusts the government. Me being originally from Bulgaria, the vaccination rate there is even lower than 30%.

And several of the governors of Putin's – of the Russian – of the republics that make up the Russian Federation have made the vaccine certificate mandatory for "participating in public life."

Unfortunately, there's – the only thing that we know of what is actually going on in Russia is through Western media, and I cannot assert on whether that's really true or not.

I've heard people that I know in Russia saying, "Yeah, there may exist something on the books, but nobody's really enforcing it."

That would be my suspicion, that everything I've read or heard Putin saying seems like he's a perfectly conscious person.

Just to finish that thought, it was the hidden alliance of former WF Young Global leaders working in lockstep to enforce the Great Reset.

Macron, Trudeau, Arden, Boris Johnson. Does that ring any bells?

And where is the organization?

It's like run by Klaus, and he's like – a bunch of people study under him, and then they go off to be – I don't know, do their thing over their countries.

It doesn't matter. We can –

I would assume a lot of them are going to be arrested.

So moving on a little bit, do you think this thing that's going on in Canada with the 50,000 trucks going to Ottawa, it has maybe a non-significant chance of toppling the government and maybe like, I don't know, having some of these people brought to justice, at least in Canada?

I saw Trudeau's nasty little video bit on people with impermissible beliefs. Something has to be done about it.

Right, something has to be done, and he's self-quarantining despite being fully vaccinated because he doesn't want to meet the 50,000 truckers.

It's a very popular word, but like mass formation psychosis, do you want to comment on that? Do you have any specific view that's really penetrated the consciousness of the internet recently since it was on a popular podcast?

Did you hear about that, and do you have any thoughts on it?

I think it's mostly just a phrase that catches attention. The culture is a mass psychosis. Already nothing dramatic has changed. It's a chronic manipulation of the mass psychosis.

I feel like that term doesn't include the trauma, the traumatic part about it. You only get to that point after being traumatized so many times.

Yeah, but our society specializes in trauma and threat.

If this continues for much longer, I would say a majority of the population will get to a point where they're basically certifiable.

Even if the great reset comes to fruition, even that will become hard to sell on those people. They will lose their grip on reality.

Even if you present finally the solution that they've been waiting for, there's a good chance that they may not go for it simply because they're completely…

Yeah, that's a matter of degree. I've considered the public to be a very high percentage of complete insanity now for 60 or 70 or 80 years.

So do you think there's a critical percentage of the public that while manipulated has to obtain some sanity in order for any sort of a social organization to exist?

Or do you think the elite is perfectly fine with 99.9% complete berserk lunatics running around even if that means basically they have to roll out the big guns?

Yeah, they've got their people like Noam Chomsky saying that the unvaccinated have to separate themselves and getting food is going to be their problem.

Well, I'm not worried about them. They will be able to get the food. What about the people living in the big cities, let's say in the States or in Canada? Who's going to feed them?

They depend entirely on supplies from the countryside.

Yeah. It would be advantageous if a higher percentage of the people thought like individual intelligent animals.

There's a sort of lemming consciousness that has been, it was really developed powerfully after the First World War. It started in with the government propaganda ministry and that faded out for a while but was restored after the Second World War and really became a powerful shaper of society.

Do you think some of those supply chains and the shortage that we're seeing, a lot of that was actually unforeseen by the elite? They didn't actually plan for that because if the city population starts to starve, then all bets are off, including the elite.

They may very easily get on the chopping block if a significant amount of the population of New York City revolts and starts literally eating each other.

Eric Schmidt's speeches and committee work for the Pentagon and such indicated as early as early 2019 that their intention, primary intention was to wreck the economy.

You can't make a new digital alternative reality until you've created desperation and wrecked the old economy thoroughly.

Right, but for as long as humans are organic, they depend on food, including the elite and including actually having a great reset. All of that is based on a reality that's still based on food and analog perceptions.

So if they wreck the food supply to the big cities, then all bets truly are off. Basically, why would people go for any reset, great or minor or whatnot, if they have nothing to eat?

I think it's to be graded carefully enough that they can weaker and sicker without outright starvation of masses of them.

Like the evidence coming out that five percent of the vaccines according to their lot number were coded to be either lethal or non-lethal.

And according to the lot numbers, you can see a very concentrated mortality from those of the five percent early in each lot sequence.

So they weren't intending to cause massive sickness and die off, but only five percent per period of time.

I think I read somebody, maybe it was Michael Yedon, that said that those were concentrated towards red states. Is that true?

That would probably be the preference of a lot of the people controlling the distribution.

But I think they have to make it look even-handed to some extent, blue state deaths, just to make it look fair.

Do you think the inoculant protein would eventually accelerate some of the disease?

Maybe they couldn't have anticipated that the adjuvant was so harmful, or do you think they knew it was that bad?

That was probably a consideration, but I think some of the people are in a bigger hurry than others.

Have you read about Dr. Bakhti's pathology studies in which 93 percent of the deaths that were autopsied following the vaccine were caused by the vaccine, the typical clotting inflammatory evidence?

Not extensively, but I've seen his name around many places.

I think in some countries they actually ban doing autopsies specifically on the vaccinated in order to prevent these discoveries.

They just write it off, they sign a death certificate, and they ship the body off, but they don't do autopsies.

At least in Europe, I think in most of the countries, that's the rule.

The policy of don't treat the sickness other than by vaccines or oxygen, and don't do autopsies, highly organized, don't publicize the actual cause any more than necessary.

Do you know how prevalent carbogen, the actual product, is in hospitals?

Is it fairly exotic, so in other words, it has to be ordered?

Yeah, still very rare in hospitals.

I've had people check around them.

I think there were only two or three hospitals that had it on hand out of thousands of hospitals.

Are you aware of anything in the medical curriculum that even discusses potentially mixing carbon dioxide with oxygen in order to improve its uptake?

No, I think it's all the phony way of calculating pH and bicarbonate base excess and so on, rather than focusing on carbon dioxide and the availability of oxygen.

The reason I'm asking is I asked several of friends, well, I guess we're no longer friends, but people that I used to associate with their doctors, and I asked them, "Well, do you know that if it actually provides a little bit of carbon dioxide, you'll increase the tissue oxygenation because that's the signal, the carbon dioxide levels are the signal where the oxygen needs to get released?"

And they just gave me a blank stare and said, "There is no foreseeable medical condition under which we would ever administer carbon dioxide to a patient. If anything, we will do everything possible to decrease the carbon dioxide in the body, not increase it."

Yeah, that's following the UK committee, 1955, that just declared that it was irrational to be concerned with keeping some CO2 in the blood. Absolutely no evidence in their support, but for some reason, sounds right to them.

So things like the Bohr effect, even though they're studied in medical school, I guess they're just mentioned as an exotic, mediocincrency, not something that's clinically relevant?

Yeah, but the way they teach acid-base regulation, it becomes so hard to conceive and calculate that doctors seem to be boggled by the effort, and so they get things exactly backwards.

I looked at some of the studies that were published on people that ended up in the hospital with COVID-19, and vaccinated or not, doesn't matter, but every single one of them had something called the high anion gap.

In other words, they were basically in various stages of lactic acidosis. Isn't that something that's basically so basic and so obvious that needs to be treated, yet I haven't heard any study or even doctor discuss the fact that most of these people are dying basically from metabolic acidosis, namely low carbon dioxide and high lactic acid?

Yeah, there are two or three studies that show you can turn off lactic acidosis just by giving some carbon dioxide. It just goes right to the source and turns off lactate production.

Ray, can you comment more on the starvation, the third world country thing? I feel like people are generally incredulous to thinking that's a possibility.

With the store shelves actually going bare now, maybe it struck some people. Also, on top of that, possible weaponized mess immigration and things like that, maybe people will take it more seriously from you, but in the next few years, there's not going to be a walk in the park.

Can you maybe explain what you think might happen?

The Indian experiment in digital currency starved basically everyone that didn't have a bank account when they outlawed currency.

That I think was sort of a trial of how to do it and do it under more control.

Gradually, they'll tighten up the availability of real currency, get people more dependent on their banks, and then gradually squeeze the money supply to the point that the poorest people die at the highest rate.

So they'll create this problem of the starvation and things, and you think that obviously a lot of this is leading to the digital identification and the central bank digital currencies and things like that?

It has been created deliberately going back to the green revolution. That whole thing was a fraud intended to centralize the control of food, giving Monsanto and the fertilizer companies absolute control over food production in the world.

Not to increase the food supply for the world in general, but to make it cheaper for the industrialized countries and out of reach of more and more of the farmers who are producing it.

I find it quite ironic that Monsanto and Bayer and other large chemical companies that the green movement used to be their arch nemesis and they were protesting against them and even bombing them in the 70s and the 80s and the 60s.

Now they're actually on the same team because they're part of this agenda of sustainable development, and for some reason, the irony is lost on the people that are protesting that their arch enemies are being put in charge of creating their food for the foreseeable future.

Yeah.

Wait, were you able to identify precisely when the CIA, etc., started to use the progressive liberal stuff to their advantage? I know there's a clip of Gloria Steinem, and she says she met with the CIA and she was expecting them to be a bunch of right wingers, and she was shocked that they were very much – I know these words make basically no sense these days, but they were more liberal.

So was there some conscious decision to shift towards that, you think?

Oh, definitely.

The Congress for Cultural Freedom supported the right wing socialists throughout the European and other cultures, and the Students for a Democratic Society and the New Left, so-called.

Those were all CIA progressive movements.

And you think maybe 50 years in the future, if any of us are still alive, we'll find out about MKWoke or something? Something similar?

Find out what?

MKUltra or MKWoke or something like that, about some project that they were funding all these bizarre weirdo people to influence the culture?

I didn't recognize the MKWoke.

I was making a bad joke about MKUltra, like a project name or something like that.

Oh, oh.

I don't think there needs to be a coordinate. All they have to do is pump them full of SSRIs and unleash them on society, and they'll take care of the rest.

Great stuff. Okay, Godre.

There's a novelist lawyer, I think he's probably still alive, named Cummings, who wrote about the progressive politics of the CIA and how they probably even were responsible for keeping Mandela from being shot fairly early,

because that would have turned the people who could claim to be progressive, would have forced them to come out against apartheid.

They were manipulating the progressive world by not letting Mandela get killed.

Mandela gave an interview in the early 2000s. Somebody from the audience challenged him, said, "You're a CIA asset."

And he said, "In order to survive in the apartheid prisons in the 1950s in South Africa, you had to be CIA, or you had to play both teams, otherwise you stood no chance."

Okay, moving on, and please interrupt me if there's more to say. I just had some random questions here, and then we can get on to the questions from people that watch this show.

But Ray, I think something you bring to the table is that you bring this kind of artistic aspect to science, and I feel like what we're living through is the ultimate expression of science without any art to it.

In your estimation, how important is that if an abutting scientist or something, how do you merge two worlds together of art and science, something that you represent that's sorely lacking these days?

If you try to investigate the nature of the epistemology behind or supporting science, you run into absolute junk.

The most trivial sort of arguments and beliefs are behind the reductionist type of so-called science.

If you try to follow up the cultural influences between, for example, the acceptable kind of science that's taught in medical schools and is in medical journals and supported by the government and industry,

it is just essentially flaky kinds of gossipy arguments, absolutely no attempt to have a sound basis of knowledge.

Anyone with contact with reality, that's called an artistic orientation.

If you examine your experience and the causes of your experience, you're doing the fundamentals that should be behind science, but it's considered subjective and artistic rather than the foundation for any kind of a true objective science.

When you look through J.C. Bose or Albert St. Georgie or Hans Selye or Otto Warburg or all those people that you know that maybe you aggregate and you express in your own work, do you find a through line of artistic expression in their work as well?

Yeah, and humor is something that is lacking in ordinary science.

They can't afford the amount of truth that's needed to experience humor.

I think Albert St. Georgie said he wasn't shocked that people were alive at all given how harmful the environment was.

No, he wasn't surprised that they were sick. He was surprised that they were alive at all given how bad the situation was.

But yeah, you can clearly see that in his writing that he's like a renaissance man. He has lots of different interests and things like that.

I hate to pick on him, but Trevor Marshall, wasn't he like a computer analyst or something like that?

He kind of expressed the opposite.

An electrician, electrical engineer.

The most practical but the least intellectual of the engineering specialties.

And then when – not to beat the dead horse here – but when you're reading their work, can you sense those things relatively quickly of how somebody is presenting something, whether they're an artist or kind of an analytical type?

Yeah, that's what spending a few years studying literature and linguistics does. You can detect hot air after the first two or three sentences.

I think assertiveness is a very dead giveaway when they're telling you something that's 100% truth and there's no – there's not even a tiny room for you allowed to question it.

Yeah.

Yeah, a level of – do you think the sign of pathology would be the excessive abstractness or mathematization of a particular field?

In other words, they're saying here is the golden rule and nobody can change it and that's the way it is.

Yeah, exactly the kind of mathematization that involves digitalizing everything, making things computable.

That was one of the deepest hidden principles of the deep state was to support the digitalized reality behind science and math.

No analogs of reality because those are interpretations and allow participation.

But the most authoritarian kind of reasoning comes from the computable, absolutely digitalized, purified kind of symbolic manipulation.

Symbols are ultimately without meaning because the meaning is always tending towards fullism and combining categories.

Bertrand Russell I think was the first person to verbalize that distinction and he essentially decided to stop doing philosophy when he saw that to a common sense person,

Leibniz had the right approach, a holistic approach to everything.

Like the philosopher said, I am I and my circumstance.

Every time your circumstance changes, your identity changes and computability starts out by saying no, we need language free of context, absolutely contained within the symbols.

And it turns out that you've at that point exactly lost all possibility of knowledge.

So what do you think somebody like Chomsky or von Neumann would say to the already proven, even mathematically, that reality is non-computable?

How would they continue to defend their argument and push forward given that it cannot be computed?

He would say your mentality is so inferior you don't belong at MIT.

Even though it was Kurt Gödel who proved that or like Einstein who proved that, they would have no call saying this to Gödel or Einstein.

When I ran into Chomsky, I was a linguistics major in the late 50s and I saw what he was doing as probably the most evil man in the world at that time because of the thoroughness with which he said that language is a matter of abstract.

Abstract categories that are born into us, into our genes.

Just like Conrad Lorenz said, it's right there in your genes and can't be changed.

So Chomsky and Dawkins would make great conversation partners is what I'm guessing.

I don't know if Dawkins ever went to such extremes.

Were you in the same room as him? Did you hang out with him or were you just talking about introduced to his work?

No, I was in Ohio State linguistics program and a professor there said with your odd ideas, why don't you go study with Chomsky?

Okay, this will be an interesting segue but ever since we talked about it last time, people have been saying, have Ray talk more about synchronicity.

And so does William James' radical empiricism and the idea that things are never static and they're always changing, does that have anything to do with synchronicity?

Undoubtedly because it's the way things are and you can't recognize synchronicity if you aren't open to reality.

But does that, is there some level of predetermination in that?

Like, oh, I'm supposed to be here, the universe was guiding me here to have this conversation with you guys right now.

Because that's more of a religious idea, right? That things are all predetermined?

Yeah, I think there are probably things like the formative principles, the morphogenic fields and so on,

that incline people to put themselves in certain situations in which coincidences become more likely to be recognized as productive discoveries.

I've noticed that routine is a great way to destroy synchronicity or at least greatly decrease it as an experience in everyday life.

Conversely, being spontaneous and doing things on the fly, so to speak, tends to increase such events, at least for me.

So I think it has something to do with the way the person's individual consciousness resonates with the rest of the environment.

And when you're under artificially set rules that make you behave in a certain way, you can't resonate with the universe,

or at least you don't experience it. And that impedes the learning process. Does it sound about right?

It's actually right.

And then last, kind of more random question, but, and I know we've talked about this multiple times, but maybe just to cement it here.

Incandescent red light or a kind of a multi-wavelength light versus a single wavelength.

And I'm bringing this up because people sell those single wavelength devices for such an extraordinary amount of money.

And if they could get an incandescent light, which would be superior, that might be a good thing to bring up.

And then maybe you mentioned that the single wavelength might actually be harmful in some way.

So can you maybe talk about that a little bit?

Yeah. The systems are, if you analyze the physics of what electronic and optical resonance consists of,

it instantly goes beyond physics because physics doesn't want to deal with the mechanisms of what the fine scale of resonance is.

And the specific frequencies are something that just never existed in nature.

And so the whole system is experiencing something new when you hit an absorptive molecule with a single frequency that causes it to resonate.

The fine structure of the resonance is always going to be something unnatural and unique.

And the difference just hasn't been studied enough to be sure that it's even safe.

There isn't enough skepticism about what pure red lights are doing,

but there is data showing that it can make cancer grow for the incandescent or sunlight type of absorption and resonance.

No one has ever seen those effects from a full spectrum.

Okay. And let's do a short advertisement here.

Okay. The newsletter, your newsletter, Ray, is available by email now. It's $30 for 12 issues.

I'm going to mess this up again. Over three years, right?

Yeah. Right.

And then they can email the same email, rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com, to obtain your books.

And so you still have physical copies of some of these, right?

Right.

Yeah. Somebody was mentioning they purchased one of your books on Amazon for $100.

And so I didn't know if that was...

They probably got it cheaper.

I've heard worse than that.

Well, good to know. And then do you have any idea what stock is on hand?

Like which ones are printed?

The one that we ran out of first was generative energy. And one we have most of is mind and tissue.

And I think there are still copies of the female hormones and progesterone in orthomolecular medicine.

Our chat is really out of control today.

Okay. Okay. And Progest-E from Ketogen, you can email Catherine to purchase that at ketogen@gmail.com.

And each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

And you know, Ray, people, a common topic on this show is liver problems, whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.

You know, and I know you're not shocked that a lot of people experience poor liver function.

How is progesterone helpful specifically for the liver?

By optimizing the degree of excitation of cells.

The same transmitters that cause brain damage, excitotoxic glutamate, for example, will cause excitatory damage to any other cells such as the liver.

And estrogen and PUFA and the glutamic acid range of excitants, those are all defended against by progesterone.

And progesterone favors thyroid hormone production.

And so the energy increase adds to the stabilizing effect.

Thyroid deficient people have all kinds of liver malfunctions including gallbladder disease.

And that goes with elevated excitability of the ducts and the gallbladder itself.

And progesterone relaxes those spastic reactions to low thyroid and high estrogen.

And then I have a paper I think it's calling like low thyroid could be a pseudo liver disease basically.

And so what the liver obviously needs lots of energy to perform all its functions.

Is that the basic pathology of that like the hepatocytes cannot function properly without thyroid?

Yeah, the liver's energy is a large part of it is used to regulate both environmental toxins and to balance the hormones.

And so when your thyroid is low, if you're exposed to pesticides or high estrogen for example,

your liver doesn't have the ability to inactivate and excrete those toxins and so they accumulate.

And so if you are fasting and failing to energize your liver, you accumulate those harmful substances that tend to be stored in the fat

or are constantly being produced by stress tissues such as estrogen.

So fasting like low thyroid function leads to general systemic poisoning experiences from the environment

and intrinsic estrogen and hormones get out of balance.

Thank you for that.

And I feel like I had one other question about oat bran. People are asking me how do you make it?

Do you have any special process for making oat bran? I know that's a complete non sequitur.

For making what?

Oat bran. Is there anything a person has to do specifically for it?

No. I think whatever tastes best for you is good. I like to add a little bit of masa to it. It gives it a rounder flavor, sort of like tamales.

Amazing. Okay. Will Georgie interrupt me at any point? We'll get into the questions here.

Okay. Could you ask him about dietetics as a form of political control? He has spoken about this previously.

But I would love to hear resources recommended. Is there any books he recommends on the topic?

On dietetics?

Yeah, like people eat beans and rice for a reason. I think maybe that was from Nutrition for Women a long time ago.

Yeah, the Diet for a Small Planet was popularizing that, making it a political issue that you should economize by making the foods overlap and so on.

It's a possible diet, but they neglect the toxic aspects of focusing only on the exact nutrient content of food.

You have to look at the social aspects of it, and especially the toxic components of a high-vegetable diet.

And maybe, I can't remember, maybe in Plato's book, what was it called? Didn't he talk about slaves eating bread and crackers and stuff like that?

Food as a form of political control goes back really far, correct?

Yeah, the Spanish enslaving the Mexican Indians and South American Indians put them on a minimal diet of basically beans and tortillas,

and saved money that way, and weakened them, and prevented rebellion because they were too weak and depressed to defend themselves.

Wasn't that also one of the major techniques of the Christian missionaries that went into these indigenous tribes and they convinced them that together with the religion,

they're sinners, they need to repent, that's why they need to eat these crappy foods, and that way they were weakening the local population and making them much more easy to take over, to subjugate.

Yeah, they were the political wings of the Spanish empire.

And then just to wrap this up, didn't Henry Kissinger call food an instrument of national power or something in his famous Kissinger Report?

Like they've known that they could use food to control people for a long time.

Okay, next question here. Thank you for that Georgie, thank you Ray. Does the act of lying and dishonesty have anti-metabolic effects? Does true physiological coherence require radical honesty?

Yeah, the awareness of what you're doing, the culture doesn't encourage that sort of thing,

but the person with excess energy is going to maintain a high degree of healthy animal coherence,

and that includes a big control of what take in mentally and physically. They will be opinionated by their needs and preferences rather than by learned principles.

Thank you for that. Sorry, I'm like dealing with the chat at the same time, I find this conversation really obnoxious.

Okay, Deborah says, "Please discuss intuition, or maybe how it relates to the metabolism. Would a person have better intuition if they had a higher rate of metabolism?"

Yeah, probably. A hypothyroid, tired person has a very limited repertoire of thought processes.

When your energy is high, you will cycle through different states, deep sleep, deep relaxation, and high intensity conscious activity.

Those cyclings will take you through a variety of attitudes and experiences, and going from one to the next gives you a broader perspective.

Out of that bread, you can put together things that would never occur to someone who is staying on an energy level.

Wouldn't intuition be just a way of measuring open-mindedness, which is a surrogate itself for metabolism?

Yeah, open-mindedness in the sense of a certain amount of going out of your self-curiosity, looking for things to perceive, a sort of desire to perceive, leads to novel perceptions and novel intuitions.

Maybe what we talked about a long time ago, you have your cultural consciousness and then the animal consciousness. Is the intuition more part of the animal consciousness?

Yeah.

Thank you for that. Okay, can he talk about abiotic oil?

Oh, yeah. Mendeleev was the first one to notice it, I think.

He dissolved iron in sulfuric acid and noticed an oily film appeared on the surface, and it smelled like petroleum.

He gave samples to people who were experienced with actual petroleum chemistry, and they identified it as resembling particular natural exudations of petroleum from the earth.

So the idea that iron dissolves carbon at a high level, and when it decomposes in acid, it spontaneously synthesizes that carbon.

That was around the 1850s that he noticed that. And it was a long time before anyone else started following up on it.

I'm pretty ignorant to this. This is the idea that the earth is creating oil, right? And then the powers that be say it's running out or something like that?

Yeah. I think the geologist's consensus is still that the center of the earth has a very high concentration of a fairly heavy metal like iron.

And the capacity of that iron to dissolve carbon amounts to vast amounts of potential petroleum.

So you would expect it to constantly, as the iron reaches new conditions, volcanic action pushing it in the chemical reactions,

then you would expect that vast amount of iron to be releasing more or less steadily a huge supply of petroleum-like molecules according to what Mendeleev observed.

Did you see the news that they found these oceans of oil and liquid methane on one of the Saturn moons? I think it was Enceladus.

It was one of the planets orbiting Saturn as a satellite. And basically, even the article in the popular press, I think it was newscientist.com or whatever the website is,

it said, "Hmm, that kind of throws a wrench into the whole theory of dead dinosaurs being the source of oil."

Because either dead dinosaurs were roaming Enceladus or the Russians were right about the abiotic oil theory.

Yeah, I ran into the Russian research following up decades after Mendeleev made his observation.

And they were doing calculations showing that the fossil fuel idea of petroleum really has no basis in science and that it's extremely probable that it's a natural geological consequence of this gigantic mass of iron or other heavy metals.

Do you suspect a political nefarious motive here in pushing that theory about the fossil fuel origins or was it just stupidity?

Yeah, fostered stupidity. The oil companies want to maximize everything they can squeeze out of the public in the process of selling their oil by making them fear that it's running out.

So they can charge higher price?

Yeah.

Are you familiar with the – I think Shell had popularized carbon footprint. Maybe it was around before them, but they had turned that on the public saying that the climate change was the public's responsibility and not the oil companies. Have you ever heard that before?

That's a general principle that the companies aren't responsible for anything. They're just serving the public.

I just thought that was hilarious that carbon footprint was popularized by an oil company. It just doesn't get more ironic than that.

Okay, thank you for that, Ray. Okay, where am I here?

Ray's mentioned considering artistic movements according to their energy and context. Is there a particular movement in painting or literature that he considers especially positive?

Well, it's the alertness factor. When it's used to point out truth that can only be perceived easily that way,

I think that's the real value of painting. It shows up occasionally in very different styles,

but you can tell that the person was experiencing reality in a very complex and constructive way,

and the viewer gains something from seeing that complexity that someone else perceived and represented.

It's like a subtle historian noticing things and writing about them and allowing a new perspective on what's going on in the world.

Thank you for that. Okay, next question. Does randomness have a place in our universe, or is everything just interdependent and can be explained?

The special place in our universe is that a doctrine of everything being random has been used to control whatever it is you want to control.

The science doctrine wants to say that all change is random, otherwise that would mean that something in nature itself is intelligent.

That idea of an anti-authoritarian respect for the intelligence of the way nature operates, they have to find some way to get people not to trust the intelligence of life and physics and so on.

So they argue that randomness is the basis of everything in the universe. Mutations are only random. Nuclear decay is only random.

For hundreds of years, people have been showing non-random evidence, and that has sorted science and culture into the mechanistic, based on the doctrine of randomness,

versus the holistic, more or less trusting in the intelligence of how things are working.

Amazing, thanks for that. Okay, next question here. And Ray, we'll let you go pretty soon. I think we only have a few more questions here.

Okay, what does Ray think of Reich's Cloudbuster?

I think he was obsessed with the misconception.

Completely unrelated question, but he writes so badly about communism. What is he experiencing that maybe you would disagree with, or did he have something – do you know what I'm talking about? He writes so vitriolic about it.

It was his early experience with the Nazis specializing in killing communists and socialists and wanting to get rid of him along with the –

he was activating the sex-pol, sexual politics movement, freedom, sexual freedom associated with political freedom, and that was – to the Nazis, that was considered just a variation on communism.

And I think the stress of being exiled and pursued and almost murdered by the Nazis affected his judgment.

At one point when he was in prison, when he heard an airplane going overhead, he said that is President Eisenhower keeping watch on me.

Definitely unrealistic judgment of what was happening in the world.

So just – if I heard you right, he was equating the Nazis with communism?

No, the Nazis were equating his sexual political movement with communism. They were killing pretty indiscriminately anyone with dissenting political ideas.

So he didn't like being associated with the communists, and that's why he writes negatively about it?

Yeah. He was put under stress by the attack on sexual politics and being lumped in with socialist annihilation.

Maybe into the surreal is like understandable given what a target he was. It sounded like he had a pretty rough life.

Yeah. His interactions with Freud exposed Freud as the cultural fraud that he was.

He wasn't really wanting to change anything to take advantage of the way oppression works.

Do you think Freud's whole theory of psychoanalysis is just a very elaborate way of concealing what the real source of mental health problems in the population were at the time?

Yeah. Reich goes into that in detail. Freud chose to be on the side of the super-ego against the revolutionary truth of the organismic perceptions.

And it's also like the key to dissolving your problems is always in the hands of this person with esoteric knowledge, and only this person can open the door to your psyche.

You can never help yourself, right? You're basically entirely dependent on that person with master knowledge.

Yeah. Basically, authoritarianism and Reich was essentially anti-authoritarian. He really had an accurate understanding of – at first he respected Freud but then realized he was fraudulent in choosing authoritarianism rather than liberation.

Does Freud have – or did Freud have deep state connections? Do you think he was working for people?

Not directly. I think he saw where his income was coming from. It was the middle class and not shaking things up too much.

I mean some of the stuff that CIA psychologists developed as part of Project MKUltra and how to break the terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, it sounds like it was heavily based on a lot of these Freud ideas.

I mean they were deliberately making people stay naked, shaming them all the time, right? All of these things have a very heavy Freudian underpinning when I read about what they did to these people.

Yeah, and it seemed to be especially directed to the highly moralistic Islamic culture.

They were already an example of Reich's armored personality. Sexual oppression was central to their idea of morality.

Okay, amazing. Thank you so much for that Ray. Okay, we'll get through a few more of these. Ray has almost sounded like he was against monogamy and pro-polygamy from previous comments.

What does Ray think of gender relations today? What does he view as the problem? What does he view as a healthy gender relations and solution?

Being in a healthy economic social environment is the first step.

The marriage has evolved from a matter of property rights of men over women and children.

As those literal ownership properties were questioned, then the new problems have developed.

So first you have to think about what society and economics is doing.

Are you really wanting an equal partnership or is there still some kind of a financial interest involved? Rich people marry rich people and middle class people

marry middle class people, and they don't like to talk about the property values of marriage, but that's still the main driving force behind the gender interactions.

Related question: How does disappearing women as a protected class, bathrooms, sports, prisons, crime statistics, and surgeries on minors serve particular interests?

How do those things, how does the disappearing woman as a protected class and surgeries on minors, what agenda is that? Who is driving that agenda do you think?

The same forces that create a doctrine of randomness, that the holistic understanding, the natural animal understanding of gender and interactions and who we are,

that can be displaced and social rules can be imposed to the extent that you deny the reality of biology.

Denying the reality of biology fits right in with all of the other authoritarian randomness based things.

If you can choose your gender, it's the same thing as having the random determination of all of your properties.

It isn't going out of your interior nature.

I know you're not necessarily interested in dissecting every weird, sick thing the ruling class do, but do you think that kind of blurring of the lines of gender and stuff is preparing people for their transhumanist agenda?

Basically, digitalizing society so that you can be assigned a code number or a gender role and that supersedes your actual needs and desires.

I think some of the rise of transgenderism that we're seeing is basically a desperate attempt by the ruling class to conceal the radically declining quality of life of all genders.

The rates of homosexuality, transgenderism, cross-dressing, whatever you want to call it, have been steadily rising since the '60s.

A lot of it has to do with extreme stress in the environment, poor diet, all of these serotonergic, estrogenic drugs, etc.

This is all completely normal instead of having to explain how come suddenly we have these drastically increasing rates of what used to be pathology.

Yeah, I think that's true.

Just one more last thing on this. If you're consuming any of their material with what they want to do, given your understanding of physiology, is it just ludicrous merging man and machine? That just doesn't sound like it would work on its face.

No. All of this talk about finding biological compatible materials and so on, it's all phoniness. Essentially everything that's the latest news in biology and medicine, it's essentially fraudulent.

Ray Kurzweil, who used to be the patron saint of transhumanism, is nowhere to be found. He refuses to be interviewed.

Who is that?

There's this guy called Ray Kurzweil. He used to be an MIT professor or something. He was very active and published a few books back maybe 10 years ago.

I haven't heard anything from him over the last five years. I think several of the mainstream media tried to interview him and he refused.

They suspect he's of particularly poor health due to his heavy experimentation with some of the things that he was pushing and saying they're going to lead to transhumanism.

It looks like he damaged his spinal cord or something like that. It's not completely clear, but he used to be the patron saint of transhumanists and now he doesn't want to be bothered by any of that.

There was a kind of funny image on Instagram and it was like, I know I'm a little bit early, but I'm also an anti-microchipper.

Like an anti-vaxxer. A few more here. Does Ray believe in the renewal of life through a purgatory function of nature?

Ray talks about orientating life towards regeneration of self-ordering systems, but what does he think of sacrifices of those systems for the attainment of new fertile cycles of life?

It would depend on just what you mean. What you want to sacrifice.

I think that question is reminiscent to one that you got asked a few episodes ago. Is there anything worth dying for? Any idea worth dying for?

And I think you said no. Whose ideas would I be dying for? And I think that, I mean, at least that's the way I'm reading the question. Is it worth ever to sacrifice oneself in the name of a new, improved system?

But I mean, I'll let you answer that. To me, the answer is no, because you never know for sure who is pushing that agenda.

Yeah. The principle of fertilizing through death has its function, but the idea of sacrificing something existing for something that might develop,

it's often the priests are calling on you to sacrifice for something that benefits them.

I don't know if this is even in the same territory, but like estrogen rising and tearing down a structure, is that a type of, I'm using air quotes here, of sacrifice for the renewal of a tissue?

Or is that too orderly, or then that couldn't be considered a sacrifice?

It's a built-in process. Growth is always renewing and reconstructing according to present needs.

Amazing. Okay, let's see. I have a few more here, but I'm going to let you go. Okay, how about we end on, let me just pick one here.

We'll end on this one. Can you ask him for further information about stars being conscious?

No. I don't know of any source of information on that.

Maybe Electric Universe?

Some of the orderly signals that there have been publicizing about lately in the news, these signals that exhibit patterns that are reminiscent of intelligence,

and they're getting them from several of these stars that are light years away and whatnot.

Do you think some of that may be like an indication of an orderly structured intelligent activity in those regions of space?

Yeah, everything is orderly. So complex ordering exists everywhere.

It's just a matter of whether we perceive and accept it or not. But I don't think it implies what we think of as consciousness.

Maybe we talked a long time ago about the whole cosmos being like a gigantic organism or something like that.

Maybe that's where this question is coming from. Maybe you said that a long time ago?

Yeah, I think so. The Teilhard de Chardin idea of a noosphere, that the whole thing is a calculating system.

Okay, let's do, I just have to ban all these people. We got like raided in the chat tonight.

Okay, last thing. Okay, the newsletter is available by email now. It's $30 for 12 issues over three years.

You can order it from rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. You can order Ray's books from PMS to Menopause, Progesterone and Orthomolecular Medicine,

General Energy, My Favorite, Mind Tissue and Nutrition for Women if you email rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And then you can purchase Progesterone by emailing katherine@kenogen@gmail.com. And each bottle contains 3400 milligrams of Progesterone.

And final last question, Ray, what are you working on right now?

The new perspective on the ideology of cancer, putting it in the same context exactly as COVID and infectious diseases and the aging process

and getting away from the helpless theory based on the mutagen origin of cancer. It's a disease that causes a mutation rather than mutation causing the disease.

Amazing. Ray stay on the line. Guys, thank you so much. Sincerely appreciate you guys hanging out. Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much.

I won't even say any more final words here. We'll just get off. Okay, guys, thank you so much. Have a safe weekend. Ray stay on the line.

And yeah, we'll see you guys again soon. Take care, everybody. Peace out. Bye.

[Music]

[Music]0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:03.400 And we're live. Okay. Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov, we were just 0:00:03.400 --> 0:00:05.880 talking about, we're talking about Mexico, what I really 0:00:05.880 --> 0:00:07.800 wanted to talk about just everything that's happened, you 0:00:07.800 --> 0:00:10.400 know, I think last time we were talking, the Russia, Ukraine 0:00:10.400 --> 0:00:14.760 stuff was just kind of coming to a head. And I don't I unpack it 0:00:14.760 --> 0:00:17.920 for us, Ray, what do you think's going on? And give us your 0:00:17.920 --> 0:00:18.760 unique perspective. 0:00:19.680 --> 0:00:23.000 Everyone should really understand what the Adsoff 0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:27.500 battalion is, that they were an extremist group. 0:00:27.500 --> 0:00:35.500 They were, for example, involved in setting a union hall on fire while there were dozens 0:00:35.500 --> 0:00:37.060 of people inside. 0:00:37.060 --> 0:00:49.880 And if they came out, they killed some, and most of them burned to death, and they march under a swastika flag, and their hero is Bondera, 0:00:49.880 --> 0:00:54.240 who was a major genocidist under Hitler. 0:00:54.240 --> 0:00:58.720 So they're just about the nastiest people that you can imagine. 0:00:58.720 --> 0:01:07.400 They were integrated into Ukraine's National Guard because the breakaway republics favored unions and are nominally 0:01:07.400 --> 0:01:09.520 favoring socialism. 0:01:09.520 --> 0:01:18.160 And since the Nazis, they aren't the same as the Adolf Battalion, but the oligarch-related 0:01:18.160 --> 0:01:23.200 Nazis control the government in Kiev. 0:01:23.200 --> 0:01:29.680 They get along nicely together. And the government in the Donetsk 0:01:30.640 --> 0:01:38.800 breakaway area, the Azov battalion, is leading an attempt to genocide the Russian-speaking 0:01:38.800 --> 0:01:51.760 population. Kiev assigned them that job after they outlawed speaking Russian and all rights for the Russian 0:01:51.760 --> 0:01:57.180 national citizens, as well as Russian-speaking people, ethnic Russians. 0:01:57.180 --> 0:02:03.360 The Kiev government has been shelling them constantly now for, I guess, it's seven years. 0:02:03.360 --> 0:02:07.360 Didn't they send the Azov battalion and they crucified some people in the in the 0:02:07.360 --> 0:02:08.360 Eastern Republics? 0:02:08.640 --> 0:02:11.600 That's what I've heard. I didn't want to look at the videos. 0:02:11.640 --> 0:02:14.400 And how does this play into the larger empire game? 0:02:14.400 --> 0:02:18.640 Like, do you think this whole thing kicked off as like kind of a cover for the 0:02:18.640 --> 0:02:20.160 biggest crime of the century? 0:02:20.160 --> 0:02:21.760 Like maybe that maybe that's part of it. 0:02:21.760 --> 0:02:30.200 You know, the Victoria and Newland thing that they were openly talking about installing 0:02:30.200 --> 0:02:38.000 a puppet government in 2014 and explaining that they had invested a lot of money and 0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:48.240 crucial to the coup was having several nipers killing the Ukraine policemen, as well as demonstrators, to get 0:02:48.240 --> 0:02:54.600 the people believing that the government was killing demonstrators, but they were killing 0:02:54.600 --> 0:02:58.920 police and trying to get them against the mob. 0:02:58.920 --> 0:03:01.360 That was when the elected president left. 0:03:01.360 --> 0:03:08.880 So it was a very U.S.-promoted coup right from the start. And the nominal 0:03:09.600 --> 0:03:18.800 purpose publicly is that the U.S., under Clinton, decided that they should expand NATO right up to 0:03:18.800 --> 0:03:29.240 all of Russia's borders. After having Bush promising Gorbachev NATO would not expand another inch. 0:03:29.240 --> 0:03:35.640 But that was just to relax the Russians so they could move nuclear weapons right up through 0:03:35.640 --> 0:03:37.440 all of their borders. 0:03:37.440 --> 0:03:49.280 And when Putin became active in saying that he couldn't tolerate any more of the advances after several 0:03:49.280 --> 0:03:56.720 of the little former Russian republics had been assimilated by NATO. 0:03:56.720 --> 0:04:08.840 Russia fought back in Georgia and what was the other area that they militarily quashed the move to integrate with NATO? 0:04:08.840 --> 0:04:16.920 And that, the nominal desire to have NATO right up against all of Russia's borders, 0:04:16.920 --> 0:04:26.480 making it the next step, would be to use those weapons to threaten Russia up to the point that they could change the government 0:04:26.480 --> 0:04:33.480 and break up the Russian state so that the vast amount of resources could be divided 0:04:33.480 --> 0:04:36.640 up, just like Hitler had in mind. 0:04:36.640 --> 0:04:46.360 And this attitude of the US and Britain has continued now since the First World War, their purpose has been to keep 0:04:46.360 --> 0:04:54.120 Russia from cooperating closely with Germany, because Germany has always had the leading 0:04:54.120 --> 0:05:02.200 technology and Russia has had the unlimited resources in potential grain production, timber, 0:05:02.200 --> 0:05:09.960 and all sorts of essential and voluminous minerals. And so if Hitler's 0:05:09.960 --> 0:05:16.800 plan, for example, to conquer Russia and take their resources, everyone realized that would 0:05:16.800 --> 0:05:29.760 give Germany absolute control of the world. So that was in their minds at World War Two, and it continues. Anything that would 0:05:29.760 --> 0:05:39.400 favor Germany doing business with Russia has been inactivated in various ways, and now 0:05:39.400 --> 0:05:48.840 getting world opinion such that Germany is practically forced to cut off their main energy supplies, the 0:05:48.840 --> 0:05:56.400 cheap natural gas and oil from Russia, is very essential to the German economy. 0:05:56.400 --> 0:06:08.960 But by creating the embarrassing situation in world opinion, they have forced their puppet government of Germany to turn off their energy 0:06:08.960 --> 0:06:12.840 supply and eventually bankrupt themselves. 0:06:12.840 --> 0:06:18.400 And meanwhile, the US keeps buying vast amounts of Russian gas and oil. 0:06:18.400 --> 0:06:22.160 It's the Germans, they don't want to have cheap gas and oil. 0:06:22.160 --> 0:06:27.560 How does lowlife like Newland get on the record plotting to kill foreign officials and people 0:06:27.560 --> 0:06:32.700 and still not fall under that US law that basically prohibited US officials from doing 0:06:32.700 --> 0:06:33.700 that abroad? 0:06:33.700 --> 0:06:40.200 Yeah, the international law is a concept that came in with the United Nations. 0:06:40.200 --> 0:06:45.000 And when the US talks about the rules, 0:06:45.440 --> 0:06:48.560 what they mean is they're absolutely throwing out 0:06:48.560 --> 0:06:51.840 the tradition of 70 years of international law. 0:06:51.840 --> 0:06:55.040 But I think there's an actual US law which prohibited, 0:06:55.040 --> 0:06:57.980 I think it was, I forget when it was passed, 0:06:57.980 --> 0:07:01.760 but basically it said that no US government employee 0:07:01.760 --> 0:07:06.060 is allowed to actively plot the assassination of a foreign 0:07:06.060 --> 0:07:07.880 government official. 0:07:07.880 --> 0:07:12.520 And this is a law that's on the U.S. books. 0:07:12.520 --> 0:07:19.800 But all of the treaties are technically the law in the U.S. 0:07:19.800 --> 0:07:24.160 When Congress ratifies a treaty, that makes it a national law. 0:07:24.160 --> 0:07:26.680 And if you look at the history of U.S. 0:07:26.680 --> 0:07:29.040 treaties, no one obeys the law. 0:07:29.080 --> 0:07:32.480 Right. Yeah. So basically, it's they follow whatever law suits them. 0:07:32.480 --> 0:07:36.400 But when it comes down to restricting, you know, special the secret operations 0:07:36.400 --> 0:07:38.320 or things like that abroad, the law doesn't apply. 0:07:38.360 --> 0:07:43.040 So how does this navigate kind of the oligarchs into a one world government 0:07:43.040 --> 0:07:45.640 situation? Is this like something that was standing in their way, 0:07:45.640 --> 0:07:47.120 or how does a person understand that? 0:07:47.120 --> 0:07:51.240 Their one-world government has to be ruled by the US. 0:07:54.120 --> 0:07:56.960 There are these actual extremists in the government. 0:07:56.960 --> 0:08:00.960 Since Kennedy's time, it's been very obvious 0:08:00.960 --> 0:08:07.680 that they seriously believed better dead than red. And the chairman of the Joint 0:08:07.680 --> 0:08:14.320 Chiefs of Staff was constantly maneuvering to get a world war using atomic weapons. 0:08:14.960 --> 0:08:20.400 Well, one of the big narratives, like the so-called liberal Democrats are like pro-Ukraine, 0:08:20.400 --> 0:08:25.760 the so-called right-leaning Republicans are pro-Russia, and then the super, like, 0:08:25.760 --> 0:08:29.560 kind of fringe conspiracy people are saying, oh, it's a big show, the whole thing is theater. 0:08:29.560 --> 0:08:34.680 And so why would you reject that whole thing that Putin is, like, playing a villain so 0:08:34.680 --> 0:08:37.760 they can do a cyber attack and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? 0:08:37.760 --> 0:08:50.960 Why would you, like, vehemently reject that? The Trump was a big interference with their plan, the American plan to establish, to keep 0:08:50.960 --> 0:08:57.960 Germany as a puppet state and to do everything to end up dissolving the Russian state. 0:08:57.960 --> 0:09:07.760 And when Trump said he could do business with Russia, he didn't think wars were a good idea. Immediately, they said he was conspiring 0:09:08.400 --> 0:09:16.800 with Putin. And that whole thing was a conspiratorial fabrication coming out of the 0:09:16.800 --> 0:09:24.880 Democrats party organization, with Hillary leading the way, referring to Putin as Hitler. 0:09:24.880 --> 0:09:25.000 And then where do you see this all leading? You know, like, the last time we talked, with Hillary leading the way, referring to Putin as Hitler. 0:09:25.000 --> 0:09:27.800 And then where do you see this all leading? 0:09:27.800 --> 0:09:29.400 You know, like the last time we talked, 0:09:29.400 --> 0:09:31.120 it felt like it was just getting off the ground 0:09:31.120 --> 0:09:34.000 and it's like gotten so intense so quickly 0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:36.200 and it's hard to imagine that it's gonna go, 0:09:36.200 --> 0:09:38.120 it's not gonna get a lot worse. 0:09:38.120 --> 0:09:43.120 Where Russia is losing ground is in their public relations 0:09:43.120 --> 0:09:46.960 because the story of satanic Putin has 0:09:46.960 --> 0:09:52.560 been so efficiently propagated, even sane people can't hear what they hear and 0:09:52.560 --> 0:09:59.040 can't see what they read. Like someone emailed me that Putin, on the day he 0:09:59.040 --> 0:10:07.000 recognized the Republic, said his purpose was to decommunize the Ukraine, that he is actually a fascist. 0:10:07.000 --> 0:10:13.640 And what I heard him say in that speech was his purpose was to denazify the Ukraine, nothing 0:10:13.640 --> 0:10:15.840 about decommunizing them. 0:10:15.840 --> 0:10:28.560 And so his purpose, since the breakaway republics favored socialism and unions, they had to say that his purpose in stopping the Azov battalion 0:10:28.560 --> 0:10:35.360 from shelling civilians, his purpose really was to go in and commit genocide against the 0:10:35.360 --> 0:10:36.360 socialists. 0:10:36.360 --> 0:10:51.080 Have you seen the other claims that Putin is basically trying to re-establish the USSR? I've heard suggestions of that, but under him, one of the critics' lines is to say that 0:10:51.080 --> 0:11:11.120 because Putin frequently uses the word God and spiritual values and traditional morality, a not very secret fascist, but the communists got to the point where Stalin had stopped 0:11:11.120 --> 0:11:19.040 the active persecution of religion in the early 1940s because he saw that nearly everyone 0:11:19.040 --> 0:11:27.300 in Russia was an orthodox true believer, and so he said, what's the Socialist Party doing 0:11:27.300 --> 0:11:33.940 persecuting their main supporters? And Putin is following Stalin to that degree. 0:11:33.940 --> 0:11:51.440 He's using the common concepts, natural in his country, of spiritual values, honoring traditional morality, and speaking in terms involving 0:11:51.440 --> 0:11:57.180 references to God, and that really offends, like a lot of these so-called 0:11:57.180 --> 0:12:06.360 Marxists and Communists in Russia, hate him for that. They want to go back to the old-fashioned persecution of 0:12:06.360 --> 0:12:14.160 believers. And so when he talks in a national, ethnic manner, they say that 0:12:14.160 --> 0:12:21.500 means he's a fascist and wants to, among other things, restore the kind of 0:12:21.500 --> 0:12:26.560 communism that existed under Stalin and others. 0:12:26.560 --> 0:12:30.720 Have you seen some of the polls in the former Soviet republics? I think with the notable, 0:12:31.280 --> 0:12:37.600 the actual people on the ground in numbers of two-thirds or more favor the return of the Soviet 0:12:37.600 --> 0:12:43.680 Union simply because they say their lives were more stable or at least more human under the 0:12:43.680 --> 0:12:46.720 old system. And right now you have 1% owning everything 0:12:46.720 --> 0:12:50.320 and 99% living in basically abject poverty and fear. 0:12:50.320 --> 0:12:53.480 Yeah, the average citizen lost everything, 0:12:53.480 --> 0:12:55.520 low pensions, jobs and so on, 0:12:55.520 --> 0:13:00.280 transferring state property to the oligarchs 0:13:00.280 --> 0:13:03.520 with the leadership of economists from Harvard. 0:13:03.520 --> 0:13:08.800 Yeah, do you think there's a, how would you estimate the risk of a, I don't know, third world war? 0:13:08.800 --> 0:13:14.640 Because the way things are going now, if Russia wins the war in Ukraine, basically it throws 0:13:14.640 --> 0:13:21.000 a major wrench into the will of the plans that the West had for this part of the world. 0:13:21.000 --> 0:13:31.400 Yeah. of the world. Yeah, I think Biden is already showing that that would totally make Western rulers insane. 0:13:31.400 --> 0:13:34.920 The way he talks is pretty insane. 0:13:34.920 --> 0:13:36.920 And also the West kind of loses credibility. 0:13:36.920 --> 0:13:41.560 If Russia achieves its goal in Ukraine, then basically it shows the West and the entire 0:13:41.560 --> 0:13:46.120 world that it's still a great power and it can pose a credible 0:13:46.120 --> 0:13:47.520 challenge to the Empire. 0:13:47.520 --> 0:13:50.760 Yeah, that's a great problem for the West. 0:13:50.760 --> 0:13:57.680 They see it as potentially a terminal condition for them, so they will resort to anything 0:13:57.680 --> 0:14:00.880 to resist that. 0:14:00.880 --> 0:14:09.840 I think they're going to start saying that even though the Ukraine was easy to defeat, 0:14:09.840 --> 0:14:18.600 Russians had to use massive genocidal methods, and they'll be claiming that Russia has committed 0:14:18.600 --> 0:14:23.280 atrocities all across the country. 0:14:23.280 --> 0:14:28.920 The shelling of the breakaway republics has killed at least 10,000 people over these last 0:14:28.920 --> 0:14:29.920 seven years. 0:14:29.920 --> 0:14:36.000 And even if we put aside the actual winning the war in Ukraine, now Russia being isolated 0:14:36.000 --> 0:14:41.800 financially and politically under the, of course, the guidance of the empire, Russia 0:14:41.800 --> 0:14:45.600 and China are being pushed together by basically no desire of their own, 0:14:45.600 --> 0:14:48.440 but now they have to cooperate in order to survive this. 0:14:48.440 --> 0:14:52.040 And if they come up with an alternative payment system and start trading all these commodities 0:14:52.040 --> 0:14:56.360 in something other than the US dollar, then that's pretty much game over for the dollar, 0:14:56.360 --> 0:14:57.360 wouldn't it be? 0:14:57.360 --> 0:15:10.760 Yeah, that's what the West has seen coming now for years. And when the US froze Russian assets and stopped the financial transactions, the 0:15:10.760 --> 0:15:18.000 Russians had almost equivalent power. They could have frozen the Western assets in Russia 0:15:18.000 --> 0:15:26.840 with great damage to people in the US and could turn off their cheap gas and several other things that they could 0:15:26.840 --> 0:15:29.800 have retaliated with it against the sanctions. 0:15:29.800 --> 0:15:37.600 But what they're doing is not trying to punish the West, but trying to just shift their business 0:15:37.600 --> 0:15:38.600 in China. 0:15:38.600 --> 0:15:42.360 Right, but economically united Russia and China are essentially, that's a checkmate 0:15:42.360 --> 0:15:43.360 for the West. 0:15:43.360 --> 0:15:49.360 Other than a major war to subjugate that union, the West doesn't really have any other cards. 0:15:49.360 --> 0:15:55.320 I think it's almost unavoidable that China and Russia are going to come out in a functional 0:15:55.320 --> 0:15:56.640 control position. 0:15:56.640 --> 0:15:57.640 Okay. 0:15:57.640 --> 0:16:01.960 So if the elite wanted eventually the US dollar to go away anyway so that they can replace 0:16:01.960 --> 0:16:05.760 it with their digital currency, do you think that may actually help their plans? 0:16:05.760 --> 0:16:10.320 The fact that the Russian-China alliance may accelerate the demise of the dollar, or do 0:16:10.320 --> 0:16:12.280 you think it's happening too fast for their taste? 0:16:12.280 --> 0:16:20.600 I'm not sure, but I think the dollar is already experiencing that movement away from the petroleum-supported 0:16:20.600 --> 0:16:21.600 dollar. 0:16:21.600 --> 0:16:28.560 And that was going away from the petroleum dollar was what got Iraq and Libya 0:16:28.560 --> 0:16:37.360 murdered. They were introducing a gold back finance system. So they had to be killed to save 0:16:37.360 --> 0:16:48.080 the value of the dollar. But now they can't do that to China and Russia who are moving basically in the same direction Libya and Iraq did regarding 0:16:48.080 --> 0:16:52.720 oil prices. With the way things are going right now and with the war and further supply chain 0:16:52.720 --> 0:16:57.840 disruptions, which is what the elite calls them, do you see the potential for inflation 0:16:57.840 --> 0:17:02.400 condensing rapidly in the United States and maybe even civil unrest breaking out over these 0:17:02.400 --> 0:17:10.960 ridiculous prices? Yeah, the inflation is already happening because of the actions they've taken for the pandemic. 0:17:10.960 --> 0:17:18.080 But I think it's blending right into the world, moving away with China and Russia getting 0:17:18.080 --> 0:17:19.080 together. 0:17:19.080 --> 0:17:25.000 So I think there's nowhere to go for the dollar except losing value faster and faster. 0:17:25.000 --> 0:17:26.520 And what do you think will be a move, 0:17:26.520 --> 0:17:28.560 a financial move on the elites part? 0:17:28.560 --> 0:17:31.120 Introduce quickly the CBDCs or? 0:17:32.600 --> 0:17:37.600 Basically controlling, they can cancel the bank access 0:17:39.680 --> 0:17:41.920 simply the way Canada did, 0:17:41.920 --> 0:17:49.520 confiscate the money of people, independent actions of all sorts, 0:17:49.520 --> 0:17:55.600 and force people quickly into the digital credit card economy. 0:17:55.600 --> 0:18:00.000 But in order for that to happen, Trudeau, by the way, declared martial law, or he invoked that law 0:18:00.000 --> 0:18:07.120 that's essentially equivalent to the martial law. What would it take to do that in the United States, unless there is some kind of a civil 0:18:07.120 --> 0:18:08.120 unrest? 0:18:08.120 --> 0:18:13.280 It didn't take any law at all to do all of the illegal mandates. 0:18:13.280 --> 0:18:16.880 They knew that a state of emergency existed. 0:18:16.880 --> 0:18:18.400 They didn't talk about it. 0:18:18.400 --> 0:18:27.800 But I think we've had a continuing state of emergency now for many years. And so they can get away with martial law behavior 0:18:27.800 --> 0:18:30.340 without having to declare anything. 0:18:30.340 --> 0:18:32.280 So you think they will just be able to freeze 0:18:32.280 --> 0:18:33.960 people's deposits and get away with it? 0:18:33.960 --> 0:18:34.800 Yeah. 0:18:34.800 --> 0:18:36.640 Somebody listening to this might say, 0:18:36.640 --> 0:18:38.980 oh, I don't care about the Ukraine or Russia stuff, 0:18:38.980 --> 0:18:41.520 but the effect on the food chain, 0:18:41.520 --> 0:18:44.160 that's like a, that's one of the consequences of this. 0:18:44.160 --> 0:18:51.360 Have you been following that at all? Not in detail, but yeah, they're expressed policy now for 0:18:52.400 --> 0:18:59.840 several years, starting well before the pandemic, is to phase out what they call the legacy economy, 0:19:01.120 --> 0:19:07.000 small businesses all across the country to destroy them one way or another, and the 0:19:07.000 --> 0:19:15.080 mandates simply telling people they couldn't continue running their restaurant or gym or 0:19:15.080 --> 0:19:18.360 whatever business they said wasn't essential. 0:19:18.360 --> 0:19:27.880 And so they just by fiat confiscated or destroyed businesses, forcing people to deal with places like Amazon. 0:19:27.880 --> 0:19:33.200 And so Jeff Bezos practically has doubled his wealth because of the pandemic. 0:19:33.200 --> 0:19:36.880 And I was specifically referring to, like, it doesn't Russia export like all of the wheat 0:19:36.880 --> 0:19:39.680 or something. And so that would hurt farmers even more. 0:19:39.680 --> 0:19:40.680 Ukraine. 0:19:40.680 --> 0:19:41.680 Ukraine. 0:19:41.680 --> 0:19:46.880 Yeah. And they could do all kinds of boycotts. 0:19:46.880 --> 0:19:53.920 They could find many other markets in the US and Europe for all of their excess production 0:19:53.920 --> 0:19:56.800 of grain and petroleum in particular. 0:19:56.800 --> 0:20:02.880 But rare minerals that are essential to the Western economy, they can turn those off, 0:20:02.880 --> 0:20:06.400 simply turn off Western technology industry. 0:20:06.400 --> 0:20:12.240 And Russia and Belarus together are responsible for two-thirds of the fertilizer used around 0:20:12.240 --> 0:20:13.240 the world to grow food. 0:20:13.240 --> 0:20:17.720 And if they stop the exports of that, then nobody grows food no matter where they are. 0:20:17.720 --> 0:20:20.560 At least at an industrial level, right? 0:20:20.560 --> 0:20:22.520 I mean, people can do it in their yards. 0:20:22.520 --> 0:20:26.120 They're in a position of tremendous leverage over Europe 0:20:26.120 --> 0:20:30.960 and the US, but they see such actions as leading to 0:20:30.960 --> 0:20:36.320 retaliation militarily, and they're very not retaliating 0:20:36.600 --> 0:20:37.160 for these. 0:20:37.200 --> 0:20:39.960 And then again, people hate when I ask you to speculate, but 0:20:39.960 --> 0:20:43.080 could you see maybe a cyber attack performed by CIA and 0:20:43.080 --> 0:20:48.040 associated? Could that be like a sink into some kind of war situation? 0:20:48.560 --> 0:20:53.840 Yeah. And it could happen anywhere as long as it is convincingly 0:20:54.000 --> 0:20:55.800 blameable on the Russians. 0:20:56.040 --> 0:20:57.600 That's their basic thing. 0:20:57.640 --> 0:21:00.360 And that I mean, it doesn't have to be convincingly blameable. 0:21:00.360 --> 0:21:02.120 They it's like the virus. 0:21:02.240 --> 0:21:04.200 It's whatever they say. It's unconfirmable. 0:21:04.440 --> 0:21:12.080 Well, especially if they're right at the point of being able to declare a pandemic of Marburg 0:21:12.080 --> 0:21:14.520 hemorrhagic fever virus. 0:21:14.520 --> 0:21:19.760 That's one of the things that could hold things in a crisis state. 0:21:19.760 --> 0:21:24.720 But a huge false flag operation is very likely. 0:21:24.720 --> 0:21:26.840 I mean, the trauma of staying home and not seeing 0:21:26.900 --> 0:21:29.340 your loved ones might pale in comparison to not having 0:21:29.400 --> 0:21:32.540 water or food or turning on the power. 0:21:32.600 --> 0:21:34.440 That might be really bad. 0:21:34.500 --> 0:21:36.540 Okay, is there... 0:21:36.600 --> 0:21:38.680 Do you have any more news on the Marburg stuff? 0:21:38.740 --> 0:21:40.340 I know you said they were redding a vaccine. 0:21:40.420 --> 0:21:41.220 Have you been following that? 0:21:41.280 --> 0:21:42.820 Have you seen more things? 0:21:42.880 --> 0:21:44.620 Because it seems like the public can only hold 0:21:44.680 --> 0:21:45.680 attention on one narrative. 0:21:45.680 --> 0:21:49.040 So it's going to be either Russia, Ukraine, or a new virus. 0:21:49.040 --> 0:21:50.880 Like, it would be difficult for... 0:21:50.880 --> 0:21:56.160 I think they are so in control of the media that they can let out little bits. 0:21:56.880 --> 0:22:02.560 When one thing slacks in the news, they can cap things up by letting out a new danger. 0:22:02.560 --> 0:22:05.520 So they're alternating between a new virus, 0:22:05.520 --> 0:22:09.120 cyber attacks, all kinds of possible threats. 0:22:09.120 --> 0:22:12.880 And Georgie, interrupt me if you have any more on the Ukraine, Russia stuff. But people did want 0:22:12.880 --> 0:22:17.680 me to ask you about the new information about the reverse transcription. I mean, you've been saying 0:22:17.680 --> 0:22:23.440 this from day one. So have you seen anything that was interesting or unknown? Recently, I think Peter 0:22:23.440 --> 0:22:25.160 McCullough and some other people 0:22:25.160 --> 0:22:26.920 have been talking about a proof of, 0:22:26.920 --> 0:22:29.240 maybe it was in the liver of the reverse transcription 0:22:29.240 --> 0:22:30.760 for the spike protein. 0:22:30.760 --> 0:22:32.920 Yeah, showing it exists in the liver. 0:22:32.920 --> 0:22:37.920 A group at MIT and Harvard more than a year ago 0:22:37.920 --> 0:22:42.920 demonstrated that the process really does happen in cells, 0:22:43.960 --> 0:22:47.200 but showing that it happens in human liver cells is 0:22:47.200 --> 0:22:55.640 very important. And just by having a feeling for how cells operate right from 0:22:55.640 --> 0:23:02.560 the start, the claim of people like Faucig that introducing RNA is going to 0:23:02.560 --> 0:23:07.560 almost instantly lead to the degradation of that RNA and it 0:23:07.560 --> 0:23:15.000 couldn't possibly be reverse transcribed and a product of reverse transcription naturally 0:23:15.000 --> 0:23:18.760 couldn't get into the nucleus. 0:23:18.760 --> 0:23:27.840 So that was all like topomorphic molecular biology that Fauci had never studied, but anyone 0:23:27.840 --> 0:23:34.600 familiar with the actual workings of nucleic acids in the organism knows that 0:23:34.600 --> 0:23:39.960 those rules are made for the drug companies, like the idea that you have to 0:23:39.960 --> 0:23:47.000 encapsulate RNA into some kind of a lipid membrane to get it in the cells. 0:23:47.000 --> 0:23:53.560 The lipid substance is actually designed to act as an adjuvant to stir up the 0:23:53.560 --> 0:24:00.120 immune system but it's been known for a long time that naked RNA and naked DNA 0:24:00.120 --> 0:24:07.420 are circulating in our blood system all the time and if you add a particular type 0:24:07.420 --> 0:24:14.300 of RNA or DNA strand, it shows up very powerfully inside the cells. You don't 0:24:14.300 --> 0:24:21.180 need anything to target the nucleic acid to make it go into cells. It can go 0:24:21.180 --> 0:24:28.040 right through the surface of the cell and begin to be incorporated into 0:24:28.040 --> 0:24:34.560 the nucleus. So the so-called principles that make such a thing impossible are 0:24:34.560 --> 0:24:39.120 nothing but the ignorant fantasy of the pharmaceutical people and how 0:24:39.120 --> 0:24:48.120 pharmaceutical people actually uncovered nucleic acid is going in and out of cells constantly and it 0:24:48.120 --> 0:24:57.000 goes in and out of the organism through body fluids, sweat, saliva, tears, urine. 0:24:57.000 --> 0:25:06.960 These nucleic acids originating in the body are coming out all over our surfaces. So if you put a cold 0:25:06.960 --> 0:25:13.320 object under your nose so that the warm breast condenses on it and analyze it, then you find 0:25:13.320 --> 0:25:29.560 big molecules like nucleic acids and proteins in that condensed vapor. And that was incorporated into a manual when Pfizer was experimenting to develop the vaccine. 0:25:30.320 --> 0:25:35.160 They warned their people giving the vaccine 0:25:35.160 --> 0:25:39.720 not to let pregnant or nursing women 0:25:39.720 --> 0:25:42.440 be exposed to someone who is vaccinated. 0:25:42.440 --> 0:25:45.440 They were fully aware of this shedding process 0:25:45.440 --> 0:25:47.720 that is going on all the time. 0:25:47.720 --> 0:25:49.600 And I couldn't be the only one that was fooled 0:25:49.600 --> 0:25:52.360 by the 5G nanotech graphene oxide. 0:25:52.360 --> 0:25:54.400 Can you, I'm sure you get that question all the time. 0:25:54.400 --> 0:25:56.920 Do you just want to extrapolate on that a little bit, 0:25:56.920 --> 0:25:57.760 your thoughts? 0:25:58.760 --> 0:26:03.080 Yeah, I listened to some of the early reports 0:26:03.080 --> 0:26:05.920 of the so-called discovery of graphene oxide. 0:26:05.920 --> 0:26:12.600 And these guys said they would be presenting full detailed evidence of how 0:26:12.600 --> 0:26:18.960 they identified it as graphene oxide, but that has never been presented. It's just 0:26:18.960 --> 0:26:29.200 there's junk in the vaccines, physical particles, graphene oxide is compatible with what 0:26:29.200 --> 0:26:34.640 they see. And there were some publications proposing that for mind 0:26:34.640 --> 0:26:50.320 control and modification of cells that graphene oxide being able to pick up electromagnetic fields could be designed to translate electromagnetic 0:26:50.320 --> 0:26:57.200 fields into particular nervous and chemical effects in the cell. But that there are just 0:26:57.200 --> 0:27:02.280 a few articles proposing that, but what they did was blow it up and said it has already 0:27:02.280 --> 0:27:03.280 been done. 0:27:03.280 --> 0:27:06.580 And then Georgie interrupt me anytime I time so I was gonna shift the topic. 0:27:06.580 --> 0:27:08.600 Something that I've been interested in 0:27:08.600 --> 0:27:10.640 these past few months talking to different people 0:27:10.640 --> 0:27:13.040 is that it seems like there's kind of themes 0:27:13.040 --> 0:27:14.320 and maybe the people I talk to 0:27:14.320 --> 0:27:16.640 and the theme currently is that people are doing 0:27:16.640 --> 0:27:18.480 and this is not gonna blow your mind in any way 0:27:18.480 --> 0:27:19.640 because you've been talking about this for a long time, 0:27:19.640 --> 0:27:20.880 but people are doing significantly better 0:27:20.880 --> 0:27:23.560 on like a one to two ratio of T3 to T4 0:27:23.560 --> 0:27:26.240 or a one to one than even a one to three or one to four. 0:27:26.300 --> 0:27:29.640 And so since that's just fresh in my mind right now, I just thought maybe we'd 0:27:29.640 --> 0:27:31.920 concretize it here with just your thoughts on that. 0:27:31.920 --> 0:27:34.960 And like, why would somebody do better on a one to one or one to two? 0:27:35.040 --> 0:27:35.200 Right. 0:27:35.760 --> 0:27:40.640 If you're, for example, under the influence of something like estrogen that is 0:27:40.680 --> 0:27:46.160 interfering with liver function and cell function in general, especially interfering 0:27:46.160 --> 0:27:54.440 with oxygen as the energy basis, causing a shift to oxidation of fatty acids, then this 0:27:54.440 --> 0:28:06.240 wasting of oxygen as an energy source prevents the conversion of T4 to T3, the conversion requires a certain level of 0:28:06.240 --> 0:28:14.720 glucose as the energy source. So high estrogen women in particular are 0:28:14.720 --> 0:28:22.320 very, very frequently have a block between T4 and T3. That's been known for 0:28:22.320 --> 0:28:27.960 decades that T4 in a healthy young man works almost exactly like T3, that's been known for decades that T4 in a healthy young man works almost exactly 0:28:27.960 --> 0:28:29.520 like T3. 0:28:29.520 --> 0:28:37.480 In women, it's about 10 times less likely to be an adequate thyroid supplement for thyroxine 0:28:37.480 --> 0:28:48.840 alone or T4 because estrogen is such a deterrent to the conversion and men under stress who have done too much 0:28:48.840 --> 0:28:56.800 aerobic exercise for example can't get their T3 to come back after the stress because factors 0:28:56.800 --> 0:29:06.160 such as aromatase have been activated by the stress and continue to interfere with the glucose function. 0:29:06.160 --> 0:29:14.440 And so stressed men and the average woman has a very low ability to convert thyroxine 0:29:14.440 --> 0:29:16.020 to the active hormone. 0:29:16.020 --> 0:29:27.440 And so if you give a ratio that has enough T3 to keep the oxidative system running and then just enough T4 to fill in 0:29:27.440 --> 0:29:35.540 when there's a dip in energy availability. Everyone has their optimal ratio. Some people 0:29:35.540 --> 0:29:42.640 do fine on just thyroxine, but they weren't really the bulk of the hypothyroid population. 0:29:42.640 --> 0:29:47.000 It's a failure to convert that causes most hypothyroidism. 0:29:47.000 --> 0:29:49.080 For yourself, can you detect a difference 0:29:50.200 --> 0:29:51.960 between a one to one and a one to two? 0:29:51.960 --> 0:29:55.240 No, I've never tried resolving it that fine. 0:29:55.240 --> 0:29:57.600 And then, Georgie, interrupt me at any point. 0:29:57.600 --> 0:29:59.920 I'd like something closer to three to one. 0:29:59.920 --> 0:30:01.520 Well, so you mix it yourself? 0:30:01.520 --> 0:30:03.800 I'll go along for days at a time 0:30:03.800 --> 0:30:05.160 with nothing but CINO+, 0:30:05.160 --> 0:30:08.360 but then I definitely feel a boost 0:30:08.360 --> 0:30:11.320 if I bring it up to a three to one ratio. 0:30:11.320 --> 0:30:13.120 Oh, so you supplement additional T3 0:30:13.120 --> 0:30:15.480 to basically change the ratio, okay. 0:30:15.480 --> 0:30:17.960 And is that a climate or seasonal thing? 0:30:17.960 --> 0:30:18.800 Is it what? 0:30:18.800 --> 0:30:20.600 Like a seasonal or climate thing, 0:30:20.600 --> 0:30:22.720 like changing in the summer or winter? 0:30:22.720 --> 0:30:28.960 Yeah, the need for thyroid is usually about four times as high in a northern winter as 0:30:28.960 --> 0:30:29.960 during the summer. 0:30:29.960 --> 0:30:35.560 And for many years, I found that two grains of armor was just right for me in the winter, 0:30:35.560 --> 0:30:39.560 and only half a grain was enough to warm me up in the summer. 0:30:39.560 --> 0:30:41.080 And then, Georgie, interrupt me at any point. 0:30:41.080 --> 0:30:47.880 Okay, so I wanted to talk about, because we only have 15 minutes here, heavy metals, right? That was something that kind of got talked about on the internet 0:30:47.880 --> 0:30:51.560 a little bit. And I know that you have an interesting, specific perspective, including 0:30:51.560 --> 0:30:55.800 the redox balance into that equation, rather than just like the heavy metals are, I mean, 0:30:55.800 --> 0:31:00.960 they're harmful, but they're harmful in context with like the overly reduced redox state, 0:31:00.960 --> 0:31:09.800 right? Yeah, for example, if you're stressed for oxygen, that will bring up heme oxygenase, 0:31:09.800 --> 0:31:18.720 which turns heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron. 0:31:18.720 --> 0:31:28.920 And free iron, in the presence of a deficiency of oxygen is reduced, producing hydroxyl radicals 0:31:29.080 --> 0:31:31.720 that cause oxidative damage. 0:31:31.720 --> 0:31:36.560 So the oxygen deficiency leads to sort of explosive, 0:31:37.600 --> 0:31:40.840 random type of oxidation, damaging proteins 0:31:40.840 --> 0:31:42.600 and nucleic acids and everything. 0:31:42.600 --> 0:31:48.840 So iron serves as like an emergency oxidizing agent? What was the oxygen agent? Iron, the free iron released, serves as an 0:31:48.840 --> 0:31:55.840 emergency oxidizing agent? Yeah, in the presence of excess electrons, when oxygen 0:31:55.840 --> 0:32:08.480 is deficient, the oxygen should be disposing of the excess electrons, lowering the reductive pressure of the cell and that 0:32:08.480 --> 0:32:14.120 should detoxify any free iron that's sitting there. It should stay in a 0:32:14.120 --> 0:32:21.800 harmless oxidized state, but the stress activates by having electrons escape and 0:32:21.800 --> 0:32:27.080 reduce the iron so that the iron then reduces, converts 0:32:27.080 --> 0:32:28.580 things to free radicals. 0:32:28.580 --> 0:32:31.460 So what supplementing with quinones will essentially 0:32:31.460 --> 0:32:34.580 protect partially from iron toxicity? 0:32:34.580 --> 0:32:38.260 Yeah, I think that's how a lot of these so-called 0:32:38.260 --> 0:32:47.400 antioxidants work. Like inside the cell, ascorbic acid is an oxidant, not an anti or reducing agent. If 0:32:47.400 --> 0:32:55.240 you take so much that you experience a reducing atmosphere, that creates extreme 0:32:55.240 --> 0:33:00.320 damage from free radicals. So the ascorbic acid is functioning as a 0:33:00.320 --> 0:33:05.000 protective factor in the oxidized state of the cell. 0:33:05.580 --> 0:33:10.300 And the so-called plant-derived, 0:33:10.300 --> 0:33:14.820 so-called antioxidants, like flavonoids, 0:33:14.820 --> 0:33:17.420 are actually inside the cell. 0:33:17.420 --> 0:33:21.780 They're working like ascorbic acid as pro-oxidants, 0:33:21.780 --> 0:33:28.800 helping to deliver randomly, reducing an electron pressure, converting 0:33:28.800 --> 0:33:36.200 it into a more oxidizing state that protects against the free radicals. 0:33:36.200 --> 0:33:40.120 I'm sure you've seen the studies that show that aside from the carcinogenicity of some 0:33:40.120 --> 0:33:48.860 of the more heavy metals, like lead or aluminum, basically the majority of their chronic damage comes from increasing oxidative stress. Would the 0:33:48.860 --> 0:33:53.540 same protective effect would be seen by supplementing with quinones or other 0:33:53.540 --> 0:33:56.980 oxidizing agents against other heavy metal toxicity except iron? 0:33:56.980 --> 0:34:07.540 I haven't seen that demonstrated but I'm sure it's happening, I think could be demonstrated if you had the right quinones 0:34:07.540 --> 0:34:10.140 of right oxidative potential. 0:34:10.140 --> 0:34:15.540 If someone has heavy metal toxicity, what would be your generic approach to mitigating 0:34:15.540 --> 0:34:19.740 the damage and potentially, if it's even possible, getting those heavy metals out? 0:34:19.740 --> 0:34:27.320 Things like coffee to accelerate a passage through the kidneys, heavy coffee drinkers were found 0:34:27.320 --> 0:34:31.840 to have less heavy metal load, especially in their kidneys. 0:34:31.840 --> 0:34:37.680 And then the things rich in flavonoid type substances such as orange juice and grape 0:34:37.680 --> 0:34:41.400 juice have a huge protective effect. 0:34:41.400 --> 0:34:44.920 But the direct chelation is potentially dangerous, right? 0:34:44.920 --> 0:34:49.000 Because it can spread all over the body. Yeah. Okay, so how would these 0:34:49.000 --> 0:34:52.240 flavonoids, what would be their mechanism of action if they're not 0:34:52.240 --> 0:35:01.240 chelators? And same for the coffee. Oh, by essentially inactivating the free radical 0:35:01.240 --> 0:35:07.920 conduction and regeneration. Okay, so if somebody has a buildup of some heavy metal, as long as they're protecting from 0:35:07.920 --> 0:35:12.200 the free radical damage, over time you're saying the body should be able to excrete 0:35:12.200 --> 0:35:15.720 that excess by its own mechanisms, there's no need for chelation. 0:35:15.720 --> 0:35:25.480 Yeah, Hans Selye did experiments with mercury that suggests that's how it works with just the right amount of vitamin C, for example. 0:35:25.480 --> 0:35:33.320 You can put the mercury into a harmless valence that passes out of the body with various chelators. 0:35:33.320 --> 0:35:34.320 Okay. 0:35:34.320 --> 0:35:35.320 What was I going to say? 0:35:35.320 --> 0:35:36.320 Oh, the ... I forgot. 0:35:36.320 --> 0:35:37.320 Anyways, let's go on. 0:35:37.320 --> 0:35:39.920 All right, we'll go on to an advertisement here. 0:35:39.920 --> 0:35:41.880 Okay, the newsletter is available by email now. 0:35:41.880 --> 0:35:46.200 It's $30 for 12 issues over ... I can't believe I'm screwing this three years, right? 0:35:46.200 --> 0:35:48.780 What was the new the new schedule for the newsletter? 0:35:56.120 --> 0:36:00.880 Okay, 12 issues which can be paid through PayPal at Ray Pete's with an s newsletter at gmail.com 0:36:01.040 --> 0:36:06.440 Raise books are available by the emailing the same address from PMS to menopause of progesterone 0:36:06.440 --> 0:36:09.040 and ortho you nutrition for women. And then progesterone 0:36:09.040 --> 0:36:12.680 from ketogen. You can email Catherine to purchase progesterone 0:36:12.700 --> 0:36:15.300 ketogen at gmail.com. Each bottle of progesterone contains 0:36:15.300 --> 0:36:18.640 3400 milligrams of progesterone. And you know, right in my 0:36:18.640 --> 0:36:22.560 limited research on hair loss, it kept coming to my attention 0:36:22.560 --> 0:36:25.580 that I thought progesterone was like the hair protective 0:36:25.580 --> 0:36:30.780 hormone of course reading your work as well and seeing it in spironolactone be used in 0:36:30.780 --> 0:36:37.240 kind of pre-finasteride or pre-propecia papers being used for hair loss, but why wouldn't 0:36:37.240 --> 0:36:38.240 just 0:36:38.240 --> 0:36:45.400 Those things are more profitable to promote even though they have huge side effect and the estrogen 0:36:45.400 --> 0:36:52.040 industry has propagandized for decades against progesterone because if it was 0:36:52.040 --> 0:36:58.160 realized that everything good about female hormones, protection against heart 0:36:58.160 --> 0:37:07.480 disease for example, derives from progesterone, not from estrogen. If understanding progesterone goes too far, 0:37:07.480 --> 0:37:15.120 the estrogen industry suffers. After 2002 when they saw that synthetic progestins with 0:37:15.120 --> 0:37:21.960 estrogen caused increased mortality from heart disease and breast cancer and strokes, there 0:37:21.960 --> 0:37:25.440 was a tremendous shift towards the use of progesterone. 0:37:25.440 --> 0:37:32.000 And along with that came the estrogen industry financing all kinds of against progesterone. 0:37:32.000 --> 0:37:35.360 And maybe for a young man or something losing hair listening to this, 0:37:35.360 --> 0:37:40.240 why wouldn't just taking progesterone be, why would that be kind of an impotent approach? 0:37:40.240 --> 0:37:53.000 Like why would that not be all that would be needed to correct that problem? It has to go with general and especially elimination of in the most factors block hair follicle. 0:37:53.000 --> 0:38:01.000 That includes good thyroid function, good vitamin D function and adequate calcium among other things. 0:38:01.000 --> 0:38:07.640 But progesterone with vitamin D and calcium and thyroid can not 0:38:07.640 --> 0:38:14.520 only for restoring hair growth, but for everything and health and natural resistance will be 0:38:14.520 --> 0:38:15.520 optimized. 0:38:15.520 --> 0:38:16.520 Two comments here. 0:38:16.520 --> 0:38:20.920 First, the studies on cyproterone acetate and the other synthetic progestins, if you 0:38:20.920 --> 0:38:26.240 look at the dosages used for hair regrowth, there were 600 to 800 milligrams 0:38:26.240 --> 0:38:30.440 daily. I don't know of that many people who tried using natural progesterone in those 0:38:30.440 --> 0:38:36.440 doses. So the reports are usually coming from people saying, why is my hair not coming back? 0:38:36.440 --> 0:38:41.820 Also a second comment, case report, a college buddy of mine, originally from Italy, mountain 0:38:41.820 --> 0:38:47.840 climber, basically lost all of his hair, classic androgenic alopecia, by the age of 22. 0:38:47.840 --> 0:38:49.080 We were roommates in college. 0:38:49.080 --> 0:38:51.920 And then he basically kind of gave up on civilization 0:38:51.920 --> 0:38:55.720 and went to live in a commune in the Tian Shan Mountains 0:38:55.720 --> 0:38:57.940 in Central Asia, in Kyrgyzstan. 0:38:57.940 --> 0:39:00.760 And he fully regrew his hair, 0:39:00.760 --> 0:39:02.160 has a full head of hair now, 0:39:02.160 --> 0:39:04.800 and refuses to come back to civilization, 0:39:04.800 --> 0:39:06.120 saying that 0:39:06.120 --> 0:39:09.960 it's essentially killing us, which I'm sure you'll fully agree with. 0:39:09.960 --> 0:39:15.280 And he lives at about 14,000 feet and says that life there is perfect and he does not 0:39:15.280 --> 0:39:19.580 want to jeopardize it by coming back to and living at lower altitude. 0:39:19.580 --> 0:39:23.160 He only goes to Italy maybe once a year to see his parents, but other than that, he's 0:39:23.160 --> 0:39:25.440 given up on modern life. 0:39:25.440 --> 0:39:32.000 Yeah, the high altitudes, the only thing wrong with 14,000 feet is it's always cold but there's 0:39:32.000 --> 0:39:38.240 very lower incidence of all of the degenerative diseases. 0:39:38.240 --> 0:39:40.680 I hadn't heard about hair growth. 0:39:40.680 --> 0:39:46.920 Dental health is very different at high altitude than at sea level. 0:39:46.920 --> 0:39:49.960 Heart disease is much lower at high altitude. 0:39:49.960 --> 0:39:59.200 Dementia, cancer and I guess you could include premature hair loss as a degenerative disease 0:39:59.200 --> 0:40:01.880 but that's interesting to hear that he had four. 0:40:01.880 --> 0:40:05.960 Now I mean I see him maybe once every couple of years, if he even comes to the States, 0:40:05.960 --> 0:40:06.960 he doesn't do it anymore. 0:40:06.960 --> 0:40:11.040 We sometimes exchange emails when he goes down to, forget what's the Kyrgyz city, he 0:40:11.040 --> 0:40:13.440 goes down once a month to check his email there. 0:40:13.440 --> 0:40:18.200 But he basically says it's not just the hair, he says that once you get out of the big city 0:40:18.200 --> 0:40:23.320 and go out in nature, he says that he cannot explain, but life is so much more real and 0:40:23.320 --> 0:40:24.820 full there. 0:40:24.820 --> 0:40:26.560 And he doesn't miss any of the amenities 0:40:26.560 --> 0:40:27.400 of civilization. 0:40:27.400 --> 0:40:29.720 He has water and electricity, and that's just about 0:40:29.720 --> 0:40:32.920 everything he needs to live a fulfilled life. 0:40:32.920 --> 0:40:36.360 Yeah, the people, just mountain climbers, 0:40:36.360 --> 0:40:39.880 for many years, have remarked on the euphoria, 0:40:39.880 --> 0:40:41.800 a sense of well-being they feel 0:40:41.800 --> 0:40:44.240 when they get up to a high altitude. 0:40:44.240 --> 0:40:48.000 First time I went up, I fatigued on the long walk 0:40:48.000 --> 0:40:52.000 through the mountain, but after getting to about 7,000 or 8,000 feet, 0:40:52.000 --> 0:40:56.000 I felt like jumping and skipping and running 0:40:56.000 --> 0:40:58.000 the rest of the way. 0:40:58.000 --> 0:41:02.000 So what do you think modern life offers as a benefit, if anything? 0:41:02.000 --> 0:41:06.740 What's the indispensable thing that modern life offers that we cannot do without 0:41:06.740 --> 0:41:08.500 if we move to live in a... 0:41:08.500 --> 0:41:12.640 I've never understood that billions of people 0:41:12.640 --> 0:41:14.440 don't move to the mountains. 0:41:14.440 --> 0:41:17.180 They will quickly turn them into, I don't know, 0:41:17.180 --> 0:41:18.740 Disneyland or something. 0:41:18.740 --> 0:41:21.700 Absolutely, last thing on this, then I'll let you go, Ray. 0:41:21.700 --> 0:41:24.420 Maybe you said it a long time ago that for hair loss, 0:41:24.420 --> 0:41:25.400 the intervention had 0:41:25.400 --> 0:41:29.080 to be proportionate. People are always saying like, oh, you know, I know my friend who eats 0:41:29.080 --> 0:41:33.620 bad and he keeps his hair and I'm losing my hair. Like what? What? That person losing 0:41:33.620 --> 0:41:38.240 hair and is in more advanced state of aging or stress. But that to a lot of people, that's 0:41:38.240 --> 0:41:41.080 not apparent that that's what's happening. Would you agree with that? 0:41:41.080 --> 0:41:50.580 You've probably heard of the priest aging, the circulatory system, but bald people have that at a very high 0:41:50.580 --> 0:41:55.480 frequency and it's an indication of the likelihood of a heart disease 0:41:55.480 --> 0:42:01.880 developing. And so it does show up in other aspects of the health. And just 0:42:01.880 --> 0:42:04.800 before you leave, what why does that happen? Like the the circulatory 0:42:04.800 --> 0:42:10.640 system causes that defect in the ear? The hair follicle has to produce energy vigorously 0:42:10.640 --> 0:42:18.240 and if your systemic energy is being blocked in some way, the skin is one of the first 0:42:18.240 --> 0:42:28.000 places that can experience, you can live with quite a bit of atrophy of your hair and skin and nails and 0:42:28.000 --> 0:42:32.500 still keep your lungs and brain working. 0:42:32.500 --> 0:42:44.280 The skin and the simus and a lot of the muscular systems, the blood vessels are protected a 0:42:44.280 --> 0:42:45.260 lot more than the 0:42:45.260 --> 0:42:48.180 skeletal muscles against stress and aging. 0:42:48.220 --> 0:42:52.000 Really appreciate it. Good. Did I cut you off? Right? I thought 0:42:52.000 --> 0:42:56.220 I'd cut you off, but I was gonna let you go. I don't want to keep 0:42:56.220 --> 0:42:59.180 you longer than an hour. Okay, Ray, I sincerely appreciate it. 0:42:59.180 --> 0:43:01.260 Thank you so much for joining us. Georgie Dinkov. Thank you so 0:43:01.260 --> 0:43:03.900 much, guys. Thank you. We only had an hour today. But again, 0:43:03.900 --> 0:43:06.800 Ray, thank you so much. We went over so much in an hour, so I really appreciate 0:43:06.800 --> 0:43:10.600 it. Okay, everybody, have a safe weekend. We'll talk to you guys soon. Peace out. Take 0:43:10.600 --> 0:43:11.440 care. Okay, bye.Okay, General of Energy number 82 with Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov.

And Ray, you were just saying you were reading about the war.

And so I'm sure to the chagrin, is that the right phrasing, to everybody that hated the

last time we talked about this stuff, I do want to talk about the Ukraine and Russia

once again.

So give us, I don't know, give us maybe an update of your point of view and everything

you've learned or that's transpired since then and where you think this is all heading,

et cetera.

I actually think it's all a piece with the pandemic.

I think all of it was planned out years ahead to do anything to destroy the economy so that

the monopolies will have total power.

And so like a planned out war, do you think if they said, "Oh, if we do this, then Russia

will do that."

It's like that planned out to a T?

Yeah, I've read two or three articles, different people predicting exactly what's happening

now in Ukraine and Europe eight years ago.

Oh, wow.

Do you think China and Russia are also kind of benefiting from this war too?

They're using it to cover their own political and economic problems?

Oh, definitely.

The likely outcome, if they don't resort to nuclear war, will be for Russia and China

to totally dominate the world economy.

And that's why the World Economic Forum class is in such a panic now for at least 10 years.

How close do you think we are to nuclear war?

What is the likelihood of that happening in your point of view?

The chances within the next two hours are moderate and increasing from then unless there's

a dramatic reason for settling and establishing peace in Ukraine.

Did something happen a few hours ago or today or yesterday?

No, just the last several days.

Everyone's intention has been expressed and they are starting to realize that Russia so

far has definitely been winning and that they're on the threshold of totally losing the empire

and for the whole world to start reorienting around the Asian economic system.

Something we might have touched on last time we talked, but I have since done a mild amount

of investigation into, but apparently the CIA was supporting all those white nationalist

groups in the Ukraine.

And so maybe we didn't touch on the CIA connection.

We've been talking about the CIA for at least a little while now.

What do you think about that?

Does that make the whole situation a little bit more clear if a person is under the impression

that the CIA is kind of the tool of the ruling elite and then they've been for 50 years supporting

the white nationalist groups in the Ukraine?

Yeah, and remember when we talked about World War II and the outcome of why the Cold War

started, the Dulles and Bushes and the banker class in general was working creating Hitler

for their basic purpose.

The first World War, the basic purpose of the ruling class is to get access to Russia's

resources without the Russians.

That's been on the record for a long time.

The Germans had the documents saying that the Russians who couldn't be slave labor would

be sent off to starve in Siberia, so essentially eliminating the population so that Germany

could have the resources.

But the United Kingdom and the US weren't happy with that falling solely into the Germans'

control.

So they worked with Hitler, supported his war against Russia to the extent that they

figured they could destroy Russia and then take on Germany.

All of that was in place behind the scenes during Roosevelt's management of the war.

Both England and the US were stalling month after month, joining the war.

Stalin said, "Wasn't it raining too much for you to invade the continent?"

Finally when they saw that Russia was just driving straight through to the West, that

was when they invaded to stop the Russians halfway.

But instantly when Roosevelt died, that faction represented by Harry Truman was in control.

Since Truman, the support of the Nazis and working with the Nazis everywhere, Ukrainians

and Hungarian fascists, Polish fascists, everyone who lost their power temporarily in Europe

moved to North America mostly, Canada and the US, and now those people are adding their

weight to American policy.

The Ukrainian fascists have been in business right since they allied themselves with Hitler

during the war.

Just to be clear, I think we have talked about this before, but Nazism, the huge problem

with it in your view is the eugenicist aspect of it.

Because again, if you like Trump now, you're like a Nazi or something.

So just to clarify that term.

No, it's a whole scheme for the World Economic Forum type, the absolute ruling class, to

control everything.

Not just genocide, it's just something along the way to make that happen and become stable.

But it's an idea of ruling the world.

And then, George, you can interrupt at any time, a comment I received multiple times

after the last conversation was, "What is Ray talking about here?

Isn't he anti-war?"

And so how do you...

A few days ago, Trump put out a statement saying that for the good of the world, peace

has to be established in Ukraine.

And he's supporting two anti-war candidates for Congress.

And so part of his being called a Nazi is that he's against war.

But I guess in the empire game, there isn't really a way to be a pacifist or...

I know you don't think...

Do you think violence is necessary, or maybe for the elites to use violence?

What do you think about that?

You're not happy that people are dying in the Ukraine or Russia, right?

No, the sooner they can stop it.

As Trump said, peace in the Ukraine is the central world issue right now.

But at the same time, without this war, the empire would have relentlessly continued subjugating

and crushing everything in its path.

Yeah, Putin has said that the outcome looks like it's going to be ending the Western hegemony.

What do you think that will manifest as?

Well, without the Asian and the Russian and the Indian economy, if they form a new center,

and if that's the new economic center, what is the Western world going to do with its

collapsing slash non-existent economy?

I mean, wouldn't that mean collapse?

And in that case, the elite loses its power?

I'm afraid it will turn into something much less than a third world, that the Shah of

Iran might be a model for the government of the West.

If there's a widespread economic collapse, in other words, if basically...

Where is this power of the elite?

What is it going to be based on if all of their money suddenly is worthless?

I mean, all of their possessions abroad will probably be confiscated, as Russia has already

started doing.

Chinese will probably follow suit soon enough.

And then if basically the world dumps the Western model, doesn't the power of the elite

disappear as well?

The only thing they have remaining is weapons.

Oh, they'll declare the common people their enemy, like the Shah of Iran did.

Oh wow.

So basically they'll start cannibalizing each other as a way of maintaining power?

I think so.

Another first time we talked about is, where does Israel play into this whole empire game?

You see them as just kind of regulating the US's activities, or how do they work into

what's happening right now?

They are leaders in insisting that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, even though the leaders

of the Azov factions fly at swastikas and declare that they have all of the German Nazi

symbols and salutes and phrases.

So it's impossible to say that they're not Nazis, but Israel is saying, since they aren't

having Jewish genocide, at least not on a large scale, they can't be Nazis.

That's the extent of Israel's reasoning about Nazism.

But they are practicing genocide against Russians, so they right now aren't focusing on Jews,

though they probably will eventually.

But people in Israel are talking about the Ukraine as the New Jerusalem, historically,

arguing that it's an extension of Israel.

Is that a prophecy thing?

Yeah, I think it's the whole thing about the New Jerusalem.

I've been hearing about it for many decades, but I don't really have an investigation of

what the theological side is.

Oh, I didn't know that.

So this could be part of a whole biblical or Talmudic type of thing?

This whole... yeah.

It's shocking to find that stuff out.

Go ahead, George.

A little bit back to the war.

I keep coming back to this theme that basically if the West uses control of the world financial

markets and of the world's productive resources and activity, then what is even the elite

going to do with all of its fake money?

How are they going to get the things they need if almost nothing is produced in the

developed world anymore?

Is war essentially their only resort, basically, third world war?

I think their plan is to use the military to control the basket of deplorables.

Us basically?

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

So it will turn, just like you said, the Shah of Iran basically will be brutal dictatorship,

the so-called Western world, and then food will be rationed or non-existent altogether?

That's kind of where things are going?

Yeah.

If you're a well-behaving robot, then your bank account will show enough for food.

Okay.

So we were talking about that a little bit before we hit the record button.

I think people really don't like when we talk about this stuff, but don't offer any type

of solution.

And so we kind of understand the chess pieces that are being put in place in terms of a

digital ID and not being able to obtain food.

And so I guess, how are you inoculating yourself from those types of things?

Or what would you tell other people to maybe think about?

Digital people on the internet are giving instructions on how to make your own food,

if necessary, growing it in your windowsill and on your roof and front yard instead of

a lawn and so on.

And are there, from your point of view, are there things you could grow that are calorically

dense enough to really make a dent in a person's diet, I guess?

Because really on a moderate plot of land, some of the fairly high-calorie root vegetables.

And just, I know we've talked about it before, but to run through them, like sugar, maybe

buying gelatin, ghee, what else?

Yeah, it's good to have a few years of that stuff stored up.

We get a few beehives for them to produce honey.

Yeah, if you have nearby vegetation that they can eat.

Do you think they'll allow, again, I'm asking you to speculate here, but do you think they'll

allow the cities to just become completely chaotic?

Like a lot of those, maybe the Fabian Society, they have a motto of "order through chaos."

And so how crazy do you think they would let it get?

I think the police have the resources to keep everything, a lot of dead dissenters and other

things peaceful.

Okay, well, we can move on here unless, George, you have other questions.

But what, we didn't talk really about the vaccine stuff last episode, and so a lot has

transpired I think since then.

And so you're probably familiar with them more than I am, but haven't some major landmark

studies come out saying that something we've been talking about probably since the beginning,

that the spike protein would not be localized, that it would venture into every part of the

body and cause harm?

Is there anything you've learned since the last two months ago, last time we talked,

that is interesting about the vaccines?

The weight of the evidence is that Bhakti and Eden were essentially right, that it isn't

just a temporary risk of death, but that it's a very prolonged, maybe lifelong or transgenerational

risk of degenerative disease and death.

Did you see the new studies of the deadly hepatitis in children?

I didn't get that.

Over the last week, there have been news from all over the world, actually, from multiple

countries about the identification of a worrying rise of cases of hepatitis in children of

unknown origin and basically it's so severe that about half of the children require liver

transplants and some children have already died.

No organ is exempt and autopsies, not very many, but extremely clear evidence, macroscopic

evidence in the autopsies of continued presence of the spike protein months and up to a year

after the vaccine and evidence that they died of the vaccine with remote organs, the blood

vessels being infected by the spike RNA produced the antigen spike and the immune system kills

the lining of the blood vessels that are infected and so there's a prolonged, maybe lifelong

attack of the immune system against your own blood vessels leading to clots and having

microscopic or macroscopic clots in the various vessels can create a wide variety of very

nasty diseases.

Are you familiar with the condition Kawasaki disease?

Not very familiar, but I know it's a clotting disorder.

Yeah, it's a chronic inflammation of the blood vessels and basically the cases of this

have been rapidly rising again over the last two years and they're claiming they don't

know what's causing it.

Do you think the vaccines are capable of causing that?

I think any vaccine is capable of causing it, just injecting aluminum hydroxide affects

the brain.

The particles travel not just into the bloodstream, but up the nerve axons into the brain cells

themselves modifying the brain so that the brain creates ongoing inflammation.

Kind of a weird question, but do you think the vaccines are more effective than the ruling

elite thought or less effective?

Probably more effective than they imagined in their design in the sense of killing people.

And you think that multi-schedule thing is to obscure the harm that they're doing?

Or are you saying that whole mechanism is kind of a slow death or it's going to accelerate

any age-related problem the person happens?

That's why it's a little bit ambiguous what specifically is going to happen to a person

when they get one of those?

If you look at the newest information, both from the UK and some coming out of the US,

the more shots a person has, the more likely they are to die or be hospitalized or be infected.

One group of studies showed that with the two shots and a booster, you were twice as

likely to die or be hospitalized.

The others in the UK show a three-fold increase in those serious outcomes for having the booster

shot.

What do you think of the data coming out of the UK and Germany showing the potential that

vaccines may cause vaccine-induced AIDS or VAIDS as they call it?

I haven't seen those.

Do you think they have the potential of causing chronic immune deficiency?

Yeah, chronic immune arousal is at the same time causing deficient defective immunity.

So the body will be busy attacking its own inflamed tissues instead of being capable

of handling a new infection from an unknown virus?

Yeah, autoimmune people are an example, sort of mild example of what is probably happening

to the mass of the vaccinated people.

Ray, you've been interacting with the public for a long time.

Are you finding it harder and harder to do that, maybe since people are cumulatively

becoming more crazy?

I would say people are becoming dumber.

Let's just be blunt about it.

Has that been especially difficult, maybe this year or last year?

I'm getting more emails than ever before.

And the extreme fanatics have stopped sending me threatening letters.

Maybe they got vaccinated.

Maybe the vaccine did do something good after all.

I know you said it provides you information and orientation, but it doesn't take a toll

on you or something like that, communicating with totally crazy people?

Or do you feel like it's your duty because you critique the culture so you should support

people and their fight against it?

Or how do you feel about the whole thing?

As far as I can, I try to give them any available insight or support.

But even when that insight is immediately turned around and posted on a forum and disregarded

or something, I guess you could care less about what people are saying on the internet.

How do you constructively use your time, given that it's so easy to spiral out of control

or to be depressed about the whole situation?

I keep working to some extent on things I've been interested in for many years, mainly

in the idea of ordering principles, the physics of life and potential.

And I almost never talk about that because people don't often ask me.

But I'm paying more and more attention to physical questions and what the possibilities

are suggested by some of these eccentric physical ideas.

So for you, your work is the guiding principle of your life?

Your work, what you feel like you need to accomplish.

Yeah, it's all one piece, whether it's biology or physics or ideas about consciousness.

Georgie, interrupt me at any time, we only have an hour with Ray today so we're going

to cut it pretty short here.

But I have kind of a, I don't know if this is maybe a fun question, but Ray, if a germ-free

rat, who would win in a battle of enduring stress between a germ-free rat and an EFA

essential fatty acid so-called deficient rat?

Who do you think would win that?

Oh, I've heard of EFA deficient.

And why do you think that?

The experiments that have been done, the germ-free live longer, healthier, but they don't have

the powerful stress resistance that the fatty acid deficient rats have.

Is there something that can bind with and deactivate PUFA?

Well, it's in the bloodstream.

I think you mentioned vitamin E once, I think it was Salia's idea or Brotobarn's, I forget.

But is there any substance that can actually bind with those fatty acids and make them

less harmful?

Not in the blood, I think.

It has to be the liver and kidneys excreting them.

Right, but I'm saying, so in terms of, we cannot really saturate them on demand while

they're floating around in the blood or binding them in a way that basically prevents them

from doing their damage.

This is only done in specific organs.

So far, it's only intestinal or rumen bacteria using vitamin E that can do that.

Okay.

Do you think it's feasible to develop something that, there are now drugs on the market that

inhibit the absorption of all fats from the intestine.

Is there, do you think it would be possible to develop something that targets specifically

the less saturated fats?

Oh, yeah, I'm sure that would be possible because they have a greater tendency to absorb

at certain surfaces.

Again moving on subjects here, but I was watching a documentary on the cartels producing fentanyl

and I thought of your, what is it Ray, the Biological Balance and Addiction newsletter

you wrote many years ago.

And so I was thinking about the fentanyl, like what, is that having an anti-stress effect

that makes people very addicted to it?

And then maybe just explain your view of what happens when somebody becomes, like using

this in parentheses, but like addicted to a substance.

What in your view that meaning behind that would be?

Some of this sense of freedom from social pain, a family that says they're worthless

or a society that makes them feel worthless.

They can just go into a dreamy state under the influence of morphine for example.

But that is imitating in some ways the euphoria that good steroid hormones should be producing.

And so part of the predisposition to use the drugs is that the stressful social conditions

they're in are turning up their harmful hormones and suppressing their own progesterone, DHEA

and pregnenolone.

And that was how I found out that pregnenolone can help people withdraw pretty quickly from

the opiates.

Quick question about pregnenolone.

Why do you think no pharma company so far has tried to develop pregnenolone or at least

use it or even in medicine as a sort of like the mother of all hormone replacement therapies?

I mean if it's the precursor for all of them, wouldn't something like a transdermal cream

or a suppository or some other kind of a product that basically contains pregnenolone be able

to replace all of these other HRTs that are trying to sell to the public?

Was there ever an attempt earlier in the 20th century to do that or they never tried it?

In the early 1950s, there were studies showing that it's much better than cortisone or cortisol

for the uses.

Those have anti-inflammatory and so on.

But it's rolled in the system, makes it even worse than progesterone.

Progesterone cures essentially everything, trauma, all of the degenerative and stress-related

diseases.

And it's hormonally more powerful than pregnenolone, but pregnenolone has the same position in

the system.

When you take other hormones, the body's production of that hormone decreases.

But in the case of progesterone and pregnenolone, those substances support the body's production

of more up to their ability to make more.

So if you're deficient in progesterone, sometimes a single dose or two can activate your body

to return to normal production if you have the thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol needed.

And to a degree, the same situation with pregnenolone.

It stabilizes the damaged mitochondria and makes it possible for your cells to organize

energy production and more pregnenolone and progesterone production.

The drug companies first realized that the progesterone and DHEA were terrible drugs

because they tend to cure diseases.

And the effects of pregnenolone, there are no recognized hormonal effects.

But if you have enough of it, in experiments, a rat, for example, would be given 10 grams

per rat per dose of pregnenolone with no harmful effects except to stop stress hormone production.

And so pregnenolone is a relatively expensive material if you supplement it adequately.

But since it isn't patentable, those three steroids are something that it's just a matter

of the cost of producing them and marketing them.

They could essentially cure most of the current diseases if they were made available massively

and cheaply.

But that doesn't interest the drug companies because they don't have patents.

So I guess my question was, was pregnenolone ever considered by the drug companies even

before they realized it's going to basically destroy their business?

But was there ever a publication or a conference that you were aware of that a doctor stood

up and said, "Hey, instead of giving all these people these individual hormones, here

we have pregnenolone," which seems to be the rate-limiting step to synthesizing everything

else.

"Why bother trying to calculate this optimal dosage for, I don't know, estrogen or testosterone,

cortisol?

Let's give everybody pregnenolone."

Was there ever a movement discussing this?

No.

There was a symposium in 1950 that revealed the curative effects of pregnenolone and progesterone.

But right in that same symposium, following an article on how I think it was progesterone

massive amounts was causing cervical cancer to disappear, that same journal published

an article on treating cancer with estrogen and their own data showed that estrogen caused

the cancer to become worse and they concluded that estrogen has great promise as a cancer

therapy.

The data pharmacologists and the research community was intelligent enough to know that

a drug that could cure a disease but not be patented was worthless.

Was there a symposium in Mexico where Sally, I think, had a presentation?

I think it was published with Abraham White, I think, was the editor.

Yeah, I have that in a PDF.

I think it was in Mexico and there are a few studies on pregnenolone that were presented

at that symposium.

I hate to bring it back to the Russia stuff, but I did think this last time and want to

bring it up.

I think a lot of, at least for myself, I'm trying to figure out what's going on and I

peruse my news sources to try to figure out what's going on in Ukraine, Russia, etc.

But Ray, in Mind and Tissue, you're talking about one of the themes of Russian culture

has been that of the potential to waiting to be fulfilled, Russia waiting to lead the

world into a spiritual awakening, the spiritual richness of peasants, etc.

And so what I'm trying to point out is that when was this book, you published this when

I was born, I think in 1985, and so for you this...

Oh, no, I wrote that in 1973.

Oh, well, even better.

So anyways, you're like a Russian scholar, you know, you've been thinking about Russia

for a very long time, and so you didn't just consume some news source that taught you how

to think about this.

And so for you, have you been thinking that this was going to happen for a long time,

this empire clash, and it's just kind of crazy that you're living through it?

It was just sort of a vague suspicion 50 years ago, but that's what you infer from reading

people like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and the psychologists, that they see a certain spiritual,

psychological, cultural attitude as being necessary to save the world.

And then the West is like beyond rehabilitation, or maybe nothing is beyond rehabilitation,

but it seems extremely unlikely.

And so maybe Russia is a chance for a future of humanity?

Yeah, exactly, because through the way Christianity reached Russia, they didn't make the fundamental

mistakes about the nature of reality and the nature of human being.

And the West is so committed to a kind of individualistic, random management of the

physical world that the mental, spiritual world doesn't rest on any kind of real cosmology.

Okay, I'm going to let you go in a second here, but I want to do this advertisement.

So you can purchase your newsletter, there was a price change, right?

It's $36 for 12 issues now?

Or $10 for four.

And you can email that price to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

And are you just backlogged with tons of people asking for these?

Yeah, it takes sometimes a few weeks to even get an order acknowledged.

Good to know.

And then they can order all your books through the same email.

And then Progesti from Keenogen, you can email Catherine to purchase@keenogen@gmail.com.

Each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

And Ray, something I really appreciate that you did is you wrote like a little, I don't

know, like a snippet of how to use or your thoughts on progesterone for men.

And so what was it?

Was that just you got so many questions and inspired you to write that?

That wasn't like a newsletter, right?

No, it was just a page.

I thought it was really useful.

And I kind of posted it everywhere.

I hope you don't mind that I did that.

That was very useful and I think it clarified things for a lot of people.

So I appreciate you doing that.

And so, okay, let's wrap up here.

And Ray, just let us know what you're working on for next.

Oh, the last newsletter was on cancer.

And I'm going to fill in some of the background of that around some of the messenger substances

that can be controlled to some extent to even actually not just preventing cancer, but if

you do it in a highly supportive way, even sometimes redress cancer.

Amazing.

That was a fast hour.

Thank you so much for joining us.

Really appreciate it.

And again, guys, we have an hour with Ray and we're not going to exceed that.

Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much.

I thought we covered a lot of ground.

Really appreciate you, Ray.

And stay on the line here and we'll end the show.

Guys, thank you so much for watching.

We have an amazing audience.

Really appreciate you guys.

We'll be back probably two weeks from now.

Thanks again.

Have a safe weekend and we'll talk to you guys soon.

Okay.Okay, General Energy, number 85, and we have Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov on the line.

Ray, how are you?

Very good.

Thank you so much for doing this.

Really appreciate it, even with the time mishap, but thank you so much for bearing with us,

and I hope you had time to drink your coffee.

And yeah, thank you so much.

Appreciate it.

Anyways, okay, so I've listened to the bits about protein that you've been talking about,

and I thought maybe anchoring the show in that would be kind of the most interesting

thing.

I'm not necessarily looking for you to tell everybody how much protein to eat per se,

but more like, I mean, as long as I've been following your work, you've been talking,

maybe referencing that 1999 military study, 80 to 100 grams of protein per person, and

then occasionally if somebody would ask you, you'd say, "Maybe even more would be better."

And so I'm more interested in how you shifted your thinking on this, and so maybe laying

that out for us would be interesting, and then I have more questions about it.

Yeah, it really started in the 1970s.

I was volunteering for a free clinic in Eugene, and at that time they were burning grass fields,

producers of grass seeds for lawns, and everyone had respiratory disease because of the summer

constant smoke.

And I had found that stopping certain supplements had greatly reduced my allergies, and so I

just suggested that since everyone was taking every conceivable supplement with no benefit

at all, I mentioned that to these allergy people at the clinic, and all of them got

over their symptoms despite the field burning continuing.

And then they said, "If that silly idea worked, what other ideas do you have?"

I said, "Well, stop eating toxic junk like tofu and bean salad with lettuce and cucumbers

and various seeds and indigestible material, all the stylish, hippie stuff.

Stop eating that and just try milk and cheese and eggs and meat and a more digestible diet."

And so everyone did, and they said, "Oh, the wonders of a high-protein diet."

It wasn't high-protein.

It was just low junk food basically, uncooked, indigestible materials.

So it wasn't intended as a specially high or low-protein diet, but for years, people

ate a healthy diet and it was considered high-protein.

But if you're an active person in your 20s, you're very likely to be burning 4,000 or

5,000 calories per day of whatever nutrients.

And so 100 grams of protein in a 5,000-calorie diet with lots of carbohydrates isn't a bad

ratio at all.

So to you, maybe there hasn't really been a change or a shift, and maybe that's like

a perception of people that are listening.

Because you don't have to broadcast every single thing that you do every day, so maybe

this isn't really new to you.

When you, for many years now, have been talking about amino, restriction of essential amino

acids, a sign in restriction in animals increased their lifespan by 40%, and you've got an additional

percent for restricting cysteine and tryptophan and other essential amino acids.

So it's extremely life-extending to limit certain essential amino acids.

And when you look at something that Broda Barnes noticed about 50 years ago, I guess,

he tried a high-protein diet, and for years he had been taking two grains of Armour thyroid

every day.

And on increasing the meat in his diet, he had to take four grains of Armour every day

to maintain his functions.

And so those two things have been out there as items of interest, the messianic restriction

and longevity and the anti-thyroid effect of generally higher protein, and the life-extending

benefits of the immunosuppressive target of rapamycin inhibitors, the rapamycin type of

antibiotic suppresses our growth called mammalian rapamycin, and so that explains a big part

of the mechanism behind messianine restriction, longevity, and protein inhibition of energy

production in a safe way.

So you're saying blocking the mTOR pathway is life-extending?

Which pathway?

Well, the abbreviation that they typically use in studies is mTOR, mammalian target of

-- yeah.

Yeah, inhibiting that is good.

Well, you know, some of the main arguments of the caloric restriction crowd is that that's

precisely why they advocate people eating less, up to like 40 to 50 percent less of

the calories, because that's what basically blocks the mTOR pathway and activates the

PGC-1-alpha, I guess, is the opposite one?

Well, it isn't actually calories, it's the anti-metabolic effect of those specific amino

acids.

I see.

So maybe five or so years ago you had written to somebody saying you didn't really feel

right with that like 120 grams of protein.

So was that something personal that you had experienced, maybe experimenting with a lower

amount, given the situation you find yourself in, and said to yourself that the methionine

was maybe more thyroid suppressive than you had originally thought?

Around the age of 30, everyone's mitochondria are being suppressed, so your metabolism is

much slower after middle age, and that means that it's much more susceptible to being suppressed

by those unnecessary amino acids.

So but you're saying if you're young you could need normal 100 grams of protein or so, but

in later age you don't need as much, you maybe need 50 or somewhere around there, is that

right?

Right, right.

And the carbohydrates go up as you, the ability to metabolize carbohydrates go up as you reduce

your protein suppression, suppression of metabolism.

And then what about sick people or just generally people that don't feel well, should they reduce

their protein intake or be conscious of it?

Well for example having fruit juice when you're sick, a very high carbohydrate diet is very

protective.

A lot of that is because the proteins, even though they're anti-inflammatory for your

digestive system, if they're beyond that very low level, whatever, 50 grams a day maybe,

they're going to slow your metabolism.

Let me rephrase this, would this be a useful tool in the toolbox for a person to regain

their health back is to try different amounts of protein including the lower amounts?

Oh yeah, but especially different amounts of carbohydrate and different types.

And you just reminded me to talk about the grape juice because I think that's really

valuable.

This just reminds me of the experiment the Russians did showing that you can survive

and in fact thrive on a diet of nothing but potatoes and butter.

Considering that potatoes have all these keto acids and basically the rest of it is carbs,

would you say that would be a decent kind of diet for an older person or a hyper-metabolic

person?

Oh yeah, everyone since Adele Davis maybe before have commented on how well so many

old people do living on tea and toast for example or jello and toast.

That's the real repeat diet.

So what can one do to limit the dangers of starch even in well-cooked potatoes because

we don't want that starch, right?

Just for energy if it's well-cooked or with butter to prevent preservation.

So the butter is the main, like other saturated fats are basically the main protective factor

when eating starch?

Yeah, combined thorough cooking with a little butter to assure its breakdown.

Ray for yourself, how did you arrive at the 50 grams?

Like what was that calculation?

How did that happen?

Oh, just that it's hard to eat less.

Even with the juices, as you reach a gallon of orange juice, your protein is going up

considerably.

And that's fairly difficult to do.

You probably have to modulate your milk intake and meat and things like that.

Even though calcium in milk helps to keep your thyroid function going, you have to at

first somewhat limit your milk and cheese and egg intake and even well-cooked vegetables.

You can choose some that have a little over-messianic content.

And then was the grape juice useful for this new experiment?

I don't know how new it is, but the things you're doing now, because to maybe offset

with the huge amount of carbohydrate you would need to increase it?

Yeah, it does have a huge amount of carbohydrate.

You have to be careful because it can osmotically upset your digestion.

The grape juice?

Yeah, I can only tolerate two or three ounces at a time.

And so I guess, how many carbohydrates are you eating?

I'm not saying this so everybody should do it, I'm just curious of what you're doing.

Maybe you're eating well over 500 grams or so?

Just about in that range, 500 or 600 I think.

Mainly from orange juice?

Oh no, a lot of very well-cooked vegetables, just for taste variety.

I just can't gag down that much grape juice and orange juice.

And then I promise we'll move on, but how has this changed your liver consumption and

your egg consumption?

Like, do you eat less liver each week?

I'm very, very much less.

Like one or two ounces?

Currently it's hard to get good organic liver such as chicken liver, and so whenever that's

available we'll have some chicken livers with bacon, but that might be only once in two

months.

Oh well.

But maybe if the butcher in Oregon had liver, would your preference be to, or be ruminant

liver, would your preference be for that?

It's just not available given all the crazy things that are happening?

No, chicken livers with bacon are very unpleasant.

Fair enough.

That's a good answer.

I think that settles it.

But why would the change in dietary, in the macro ratios change the intake of liver for

you as well?

You feel like you need less?

You don't feel like I need less.

But liver is a huge source of methionine, right?

Yeah.

And really early on, probably ten years ago, I think I ate eight ounces of liver and I

felt real cold afterwards, and then the next day felt especially hypothyroid.

So it might be just good for posterity.

The methionine, what is the specific mechanism that it's suppressing the thyroid function?

Or is it doing lots of different things?

Lots of things.

I don't know what the most important mechanism is.

Fair enough.

And we can move on and Georgie, interrupt me at any time here.

Something I've noticed, you had mentioned it a long time ago, that people with a physically

larger brain might notice symptoms really quickly.

They have really high energy requirements, and if those requirements weren't met, they

would notice it and kind of nuance symptoms about their health.

You know, that idea, I keep thinking about it because the people I talk to are all really

interesting.

They're all interesting people with interesting ideas, with different backgrounds, and I would

bet that they're very, I mean, I know they're intelligent.

And so, but some of the smartest people will notice the tiniest little defects in their

body.

And so I was wondering if you could just speak about brain metabolism and then noticing symptoms.

Yeah, the brain requires, in an absolute sense, a steady supply of glycogen and glucose.

So just excited thinking can consume really large amounts of sugar.

And checking your blood pressure, it's called the pulse pressure or the difference between

systolic and diastolic pressures.

If everything is running smoothly with enough blood sugar, you'll have a systolic that's

at least 50 points, about 50 points higher than the diastolic, very often lower.

But if you're having a problem with your glucose, you're going to have increased difference

with maybe 75 points higher systolic than diastolic.

And if you get in that condition from excitation or whatever cause, anything that depletes

your systemic glycogen, then by checking your pulse pressure frequently and increasing your

glucose and starch intake considerably, every few hours checking it and having more glucose,

you can tell when you have replenished the glycogen source because suddenly your difference

between systolic and diastolic will come down to 40 or 45 points difference.

Wow, that's useful to know.

And then in the same kind of line of questioning, would you expect somebody that had a real

low rate of metabolism and maybe had, I mean, we all have imperfect development, but somebody

with like a physically smaller brain or something that had three vaccines and just taking finasteride

and stuff and says they don't notice the difference, but like maybe somebody that's running at

a really low level would not notice these like toxic insults that are happening every

moment of the day to them.

Could that equally be true?

I think it is.

People that take SRI drugs are basically very prone to not only self-harm, but also like

getting wounds that they sometimes they sit there and fester because they ignored them,

they never felt the pain and they couldn't disinfect them.

So people with high serotonin, I think they tend to experience higher emotional pain,

but they're numbed at the extremities.

And I've noticed several people around me that are taking these drugs.

They often have these wounds and scrapes on them that look pretty ghastly and they only

notice them when I point them out.

They claim they didn't hurt when they actually happened.

Yeah, that sort of thing eventually is corrected by keeping your thyroid chronically a lot

higher.

And then keeping in line with the things I'm learning from the people I talk to, I'm probably

talking to like four people right now that can take 200 milligrams of Progest-E and it

has no effect whatsoever, but they all seem to uniformly benefit from antibiotics, like

specifically the tetracyclines or the macrolides.

But they don't necessarily have digestive problems per se.

And so clearly they're, or maybe they're benefiting from the antibiotics anti-inflammatory effect.

And then again, I know this is kind of redundant because you've talked about this a lot, but

what do you think is a good approach or strategies for somebody that might have a nitric oxide

problem if that's what's going on and their liver is not maybe responding to the huge

amount of progesterone?

Would a small amount of T3 be useful, like one or two micrograms per hour?

I think so.

And it all works.

Everything that you have to regulate with, nervous system, hormones, digestive enzyme

balance and so on, all of those are involved so that your cholinergic nervous system activity

and your adrenergic system are activated in different ways.

The helplessness cholinergic reflexes interfere with everything good so that you make more

nitric oxide for example and slow things down and cause inflammatory damage.

Is there something I'm not thinking of that would be useful for that situation?

Like oh, I have an experience with this person writing me that they overcame that situation

with XYZ or is it like a...

Go ahead.

Looking at the whole picture and seeing which you're in most desperate need of.

What about the tool in the toolbox of reducing protein?

Would that be especially useful for somebody maybe with like a...

Do you think what I'm describing is liver disease?

Like a person not responding to the progesterone?

Yeah, and that can be a quickly repaired thing by getting the glycogen up.

The liver turns off just like the brain if it hasn't stored enough glycogen and that

is a matter of two or three days often.

So for liver disease, glycogen should be the top priority and glycogenesis can't happen

without T3 and progesterone and enough carbohydrate?

Yeah.

Since you mentioned the cholinergic system, do you think that's the main risk of people

using nicotine besides its many beneficial effects?

The problem is that it is the direct activator of the acetylcholine receptors.

The problem with using which?

Well, several people have asked you about using nicotine from tobacco as a chewing gum

or actually as a tincture or just as an isolated substance and you've said several times that

it may be beneficial.

It's got a number of beneficial effects but you're wary of it and you don't recommend

long-term use and do you think that the fact that nicotine is actually a direct ligand

for that system, an activator of the cholinergic system, do you think that's the main risk

associated with it?

I think that's likely.

It's part of your cholinergic system and you can't be sure how the nicotine is going to

fit into the anti-inflammatory system.

It has that potential but it can do the opposite too and turn on cancer metabolism.

Why do you think that tobacco consumption is so widespread among indigenous cultures,

especially the ones that are in the Americas?

Because it's stimulating value, psychologically it can tone things up and make you function.

So it's mostly as a stimulant, as a widely available stimulant?

Yeah, I think so.

Just going back to the glycogen for a second, two things I know you've mentioned that can

deplete the liver of its glycogen, the estrogen and maybe the serotonin and maybe they're

working on the same mechanism.

Does the methionine, how does that relate to the estrogen and the serotonin, does that

tend to increase them?

Yeah.

It has a demobilizing function and the methyl groups are in a constant battle.

There's been too much emphasis on people who don't have enough methyl groups and not enough

on the danger of an excess methyl pressure.

So in addition to the methionine and the insulinogenic effects of the protein, that could be a slippery

slope for a person with an under-functioning liver.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, just a few more and then we can talk about cultural things.

And Ray, I'm not going to keep you too long.

And so the other thing that's completely unrelated.

But Ray, lidocaine as a topical for hair loss, what do you think about that?

It's generally self-protective and I don't know anyone who has tried it, but since it

works for all kinds of very serious conditions, even helping with cancer and brain injury,

it's almost always a good thing to try.

There is a -- oh, sorry, go ahead.

It prevents energy waste and so working at the simple level of available energy, it makes

everything better.

And then I have at least one paper in regards to so-called pattern baldness.

They say investigation should be done on mast cell inhibitors for pattern baldness.

And so obviously, the lidocaine would help with that, right?

Mm-hmm.

And the whole world wants me to ask you about the massage thing.

And so everybody is asking, what is he specifically talking about?

What type of massage?

So in my point of view, the massage ideas that were going around were like, don't stop

until your head is inflamed and red and has obvious inflammation in it.

So what type of massage were you thinking about that you thought could increase hair

growth?

Oh, just a very gentle massage such as gently rubbing oil into it.

You don't want to cause inflammation.

And the mechanism there might be -- obviously, it feels good, but maybe increasing the blood

flow to the area that is a problem with the hair loss?

Yeah, feeling good is a good way to increase blood flow.

If you increase blood flow by irritation, that's because you're doing damage that causes

lactic acid production and blocking good energy production.

So a very soft, stimulating, pleasure-giving massage is the opposite of a rough, irritating

massage.

Thanks for that.

And last question from me, and then we can move on.

The most -- maybe you can concur, but the most common thing with thyroid dosing with

Cynoplus and Cynomel is overdosing.

Maybe once a week, somebody tells me I started with a tablet of Cynoplus and a tablet of

Cynomel just as a starting dose.

And so I have a few questions for you about this.

So one, we've talked many, many times about maybe 10 micrograms of T3 being kind of a

limit for dosing thyroid, or maybe even an arbitrary limit, and using that with a meal.

When you take 15 or 20, what -- maybe you had said previously that the liver creates

enzymes to destroy it really quickly.

Maybe you can just expand on that a bit.

Yeah, so after a couple of weeks of doing that, you are -- after maybe 10 or 12 hours

after that overdose, you have plunged to a hypothyroid state.

And if you're dosing it only once or twice a day, those ups and downs become really extreme

and can do things like stopping your heart rate when your thyroid dips sharply.

And then just because we've been talking about it so much, for a person with liver disease,

in your experience and from what you've read, do they tend to do better on smaller doses

of T3 or bigger doses?

Like what --

Oh, smaller.

I think no one should supplement thyroid until they've read at least one of Broda Barnes'

books.

Maybe the "It's Not Your Mind, It's Your Liver," the "Hope for Hypoglycemia?"

Yeah.

I think they just started reprinting that as a side note.

And shoot, I had another question about the T3.

Oh, do you think it's a good idea to -- like I've seen the overdosing stuff so often that

I started recommending people buy $20 milligram scales.

And as annoying as that is, I'm just worried about people taking too much.

And so if they measure a tablet of Cynomel, which is usually about 100 milligrams, and

then they do that cross-reference math, and then they find the microgram dosage, do you

think that's a good way to do it?

Or is that too -- is that crazy?

I'm not sure whether they're actually going to be getting the right amount of T3.

If it's well distributed in the tablet, I think powdering a Cynomel tablet and figuring

that you're taking two or three micrograms at a time, you're in least danger of having

a suppression.

So that's good to know.

So I did not know that.

So you think there could be a huge amount of T3 on one side of the pill and not enough

on the other side?

It's just conceivable.

Very interesting.

I appreciate you pointing that out.

And then once it's powdered, if a person wants to go for accuracy, they could measure it?

Yeah, but I would tend to go by the label.

If it's Cynomel or Cynomel, I think you can count on the amount per tablet being accurate.

But none of the generics that I've tried has been reliably to the potency that they claim.

But once you powder a Cynomel tablet, if somebody was in a precarious situation and they're

like, "Okay, I'm going to try two micrograms," how do you even go about doing that?

You'd have to have a scale, right?

Just by visual judgment, you powder a 25-microgram tablet and divide it into 10 apparently equal

pieces.

Okay, fair enough.

I know you're maybe resistant to recommending a super complex type of thing, but if a person

wanted to go for very accurate doses, do you think that's a bad idea to do the scale?

Would that not be as accurate as the person thinks it is?

It's misleading because your body isn't that accurate.

The body responds very differently every time.

There's no scale equivalent in the body.

It's always a new experience for the body.

But what you're saying is it's basically impossible to get an accurate dose of thyroid and you

just have to go off feeling, which I can accept.

By the feeling, right?

Your temperature, pulse rate and feeling.

Okay, fair enough.

Okay, I guess we'll let you go really soon here, Ray, but I just wanted to catch up on

the cultural stuff.

So maybe, I don't know, three, four months ago, we asked you, "Are things still going

to plan?"

And I just wanted to get your update about that.

Do you still think things are going to plan?

Not our plan, the oligarchs' insane psycho plan.

Which things?

Like the things you're seeing right now with the war and the rallying about monkeypox and

everything that's happening and then the Fed starting to talk about the digital dollar

and servers being online in February 2023.

I guess sometimes a person will say, "Hey, I think their plan is failing."

So do you think that?

Is that your orientation, that things are not going well for them?

Oh, yeah, everything they're doing is becoming stupid and obvious, but they have rigged it

so that stupid and obvious aren't impediments to going ahead.

The banks say that there's simply no alternative to digital money and they're just going ahead

with it according to plan.

It takes time to write all of the programs to manage all of the money in the world in

a stereotyped manner so that no one has actual money but everyone is on a retainer of a certain

loud amount of money.

As soon as they can write the programs to administer that, they're intending it to come

out in something like two or three years just to get the bank machinery set up to do it.

Even though everyone who thinks about it realizes it's absolutely evil, deadly, going to ruin

the whole ecosphere, they have created essentially a mass dementia, an epidemic of dementia in

which people can't even begin to think about how to get out of that deadly fate.

So a more direct question, as you now see, I mean I'm sure you've seen, Russia and China

are basically, have solidified their union.

Russia has said, "We're done with the West.

It's over."

They're about to start their own currency.

The BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China, the organization, and now they've added more

to that organization, is also about to launch its own currency backed by commodities.

What do you think is going to happen over the next six to 12 months in the West without

food and potentially without raw materials for energy in Europe and maybe even in the

United States?

Are we looking at a mass famine event here in the States in the next six to 12 months?

The production of grain by Ukraine and Russia is still there so that the worst of starvation

in the southern world can be alleviated, but everything is going to be under maximum tension

and the only thing that is keeping away a sort of terminal starvation condition is the

success of the Russian-Chinese third world axis.

They are on the threshold of a successful world economy and the main danger of that

is that the West can't see any non-demanded solutions, so they're increasingly likely

to resort to nuclear weapons.

We're basically looking at World War III because the West is now out of options.

I just don't see what the West has remaining.

Obviously, they're going to try to go full fascism first just to keep the population

under control, but still that doesn't resolve the immediate situation, which is the economy

of the West is done.

There's literally almost no productive activity left here.

Do you think that now with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the economy formally,

not that there was much of it remaining before, but even now the fake money is going to disappear

or at least significantly be curtailed because of the higher interest rate, do you foresee

things getting rougher over the next six to 12 months or do you think there's some kind

of an opportunity for improvement?

No, I think the West is just committed to everything getting worse.

Ray, you echoed, I'm kicking myself because I can't remember this reporter's name, but

he's in the Ukraine and he basically said that the Ukraine is getting slaughtered by

Russia right now, then he thought the US would then send in troops, they would also get slaughtered,

and then the only thing the US could do is, because they never apparently said they would

not do a first strike, that they would use nuclear weapons.

Do you think that is a plausible scenario?

Yes, the state of dementia that they have created for themselves leads almost inexorably

to that.

Was that Goncalo Lieber?

Yes.

He's really funny.

Yeah, I mean he's compelling.

Does your animal instinct, the first signal system, does it tell you right now that the

West is done?

Yeah, I never hear Lieber say anything wrong.

He is extremely compelling and him being close to the action is also pretty useful.

He had another one saying that, we've talked about this on a podcast before, but the Americans

have such a strong normalcy bias that they can't see what's coming right around the corner.

I feel like I experience that every day.

I feel like this is wartime, but I'm not saying people should have my crazy attitude or whatever,

but people seem like they're kind of complacent or think because we're in a reprieve from

this crazy, like masks are disappearing and stuff, that things are going to get better.

But I mean, if he's right, things are just going to get significantly worse fast, like

really quickly within the next six months or so.

Yeah.

I think it's approximately the schedule that I think is inevitable.

Have you bought any canned food that can last you a few months?

No, the cans are a nuisance.

I always have a barrel of coconut oil and some powdered milk and a lot of grains.

And sugar, right?

George said and sugar, right?

And what?

Sugar, and bald or sugar, basically, white sugar.

The low protein stuff is actually pretty useful entering into a dystopian future.

Exactly, right?

So less eggs and, oh, we didn't really talk about that, but what, has your egg consumption

also decreased?

Yeah, the good thing about the carbohydrates is that they're cheap, will continue to be

quickly produced and are easy to preserve.

So if you just avoided the methionine, the PUFA, the iron, all the food additives, even

walking into a dystopian future, you could probably feel relatively okay.

Possibly.

Yeah.

Okay.

I've talked to, I mean, because I always try to see the arguments of the other side.

So over the years, ever since this whole thing, the craziness with the pandemic started, I

tried to talk to some moderates and some people really at the other extreme.

And over the last two years, everybody that was moderate, that was willing to consider

that maybe there was some nefariousness, but they're trying to kind of like buy their time

and see how things go.

Every single one of these people has been so-called red-pilled, have moved towards the

side that says, "Wow, things are really bad."

And then the people who used to be simply optimistic now have become extreme to the

point that they don't even want to be bothered.

And whenever you bring stuff up about like potential world war or anything like that,

they just refuse to listen, which to me is saying that we are living in very extreme

times.

One last thing about the nuclear war.

There's nothing to do about that.

Like if they, I mean, if they use nukes, like there's no amount of, I mean, have you made

any preparations whatsoever if that happens?

Just to drive south as quickly as possible.

Or towards the middle of the country where they probably wouldn't waste the nuke on?

Yeah, but the clouds will concentrate over the northern hemisphere.

So the farther south you go, the quicker, the less likely you are to be quickly killed.

Would you have to go, the closer to the equator, the better?

Yeah.

In Mexico, would you have to go to like Chiapas or would Michoacan be the best place to be

for that?

Yeah, I think for the present, Michoacan is good.

High altitude, moderate rainfall.

What will be some remedies, potential for low level radiation exposure?

Especially if it doesn't kill immediately or cause cancer over the next year, what could

be some things that could decrease the long term damage?

Using fossil, if you have a greenhouse, heating it with fossil fuels so that you avoid such

things as strontium fallout and get stable calcium.

Avoid the frequent things that are very quick to absorb radiation.

Avoid vegetables that are growing right after the fallout.

But that would include also animal food, right?

Because the radiation will concentrate in their bones and brain and the fat tissue?

Yeah.

And so old food, if you find old stores of dehydrated or canned foods, they're the first

thing to use.

Last thing for me, one of the common retorts, if I'm talking about Mexico with somebody,

is that they don't want to go because of the cartels here.

You know what, in a dystopian future with a nuclear radiation sea, what do you see the

cartels function as when things get really bad?

You think they would take over Mexico and it would be really bad or would you prefer

that over some kind of digitized prison in the US?

You have to pick your poison or what do you think about that?

The cartels are just effectively capital.

So there's not going to be anything particularly bad about what they do.

I think they only exist because there's a huge market up north, right?

And they're controlled by the CIA.

If these things disappear, the cartels will have to find another job, which probably involves

working the land and doing something productive.

Yeah, they've turned to things like avocados instead of drugs.

You don't think it would turn into kind of organized mafia type of thing, just like crime?

I mean, that will probably just happen everywhere if things get really bad.

Yeah.

Okay, let's do the advertisement real fast.

The newsletter is available by email now.

It's $36 for 12 issues, which can be paid through rayPeats@gmail.com.

You can also order Ray's books, "From PMS to Menopause," "Progesterone in Orthomolecular

Medicine," "Gender of Energy," "Mind and Tissue," and "Nutrition for Women" by emailing that

same address.

And then also Progest-E from Keenogen.

You can email Catherine to purchasekeenogen@gmail.com.

Each bottle of Progest-E is 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

And Ray, do you have any recent progesterone stories from people saying that it did this

or that?

No, nothing special I've heard.

I usually have one in the can, but I can't think of anything.

Georgi, do you have one?

Yes, I do.

I have a person who lives in Europe who's been emailing me and basically they got diagnosed

with what the doctors thought were benign tumors in the liver.

And then they did a biopsy and turned out one of the nodules was actually malignant.

And then this person really freaked out.

I think he bought Ray's Progest-E or had it from before and basically took the equivalent

of about a teaspoon daily, I think for two weeks.

And then they went back and then basically the malignant nodule had completely disappeared.

And then of the four remaining nodules that were basically proven benign, three had also

disappeared and the last one had shrunk to the size of a pinhead.

And after another two weeks, that one was gone as well.

Amazing.

Hey Georgi, Ray, thank you so much for doing this.

Ray, stay on the line and we'll close the show.

We have an amazing listenership.

Thank you guys so much.

We only had Ray for an hour today, so we're not going to exceed that.

Thank you guys so much for bearing with us and have a great weekend.

We'll talk to you guys soon.

Okay, bye everyone.

Okay, bye.
