## Transcript

**Speaker A** (00:00): Well, welcome once again to this month's ask your Rev. Dr. My name is Andrew Murray. As always, for those who have tuned in and have not listened to the show before, we broadcast every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm on Kmudgalville 91.1 FM. We're discussing a wide range of alternative medicines, health topics related to alternatives, and I'm very pleased as always to have Dr. Raymond Peete join us once more. For those who may not know you, Dr. Pete, would you please give our listeners a rundown of your academic and professional background before we introduce our next guest.

**Speaker B** (00:36): After studying and teaching the humanities and linguistics and various things except biology before 1968, then I went to graduate school in biology to get a Ph.D. 1972 and specialized in aging physiology of reproduction, but in general studied physiology and biochemistry and since then have been doing short courses and counseling and such.

**Speaker A** (01:11): Okay, excellent. All right. And this month very specially I'm very pleased to welcome a second generation. Well, actually that's not true. I, I've called her a second generation medical herbalist because I didn't understand her father's actual background before. But anyway. Sophie Lam, daughter of distinguished medical herbalist Brian Lam. Welcome to the show, Sophie.

**Speaker C** (01:34): Thank you so much. I'm so delighted to be here.

**Speaker A** (01:37): So let me ask you this. I've always called you a second generation herbalist, but actually your father's background is.

**Speaker C** (01:47): Well, my father's background is there's about four generations of doctors and surgeons going back about 200 years. And although they were surgeons and doctors, a big part of the medicines that they used at the time was herbal medicine. So they had their apothecaries alongside their surgeries.

**Speaker A** (02:05): Okay, I know Brian, he's 82 now. He qualified, I think I'm right in saying he qualified in 1978 from what was then the school of herbal medicine before the degrees came into place and the honors degrees that were given to herbal medicines. And he's been in full time practice since and he also manufactures a wide range of fluid extracts, syrups and some time honoured recipes using medicinal herbs. And he has a fairly busy practice as well as working day to day.

**Speaker C** (02:40): He does, he's so amazing. So he's nearly 82 and he works full time, gets up very early with the birds and works all day long. And I'm just amazed at the energy he still has at his age. And I think it's driven by the passion that he has for his job, the love, love he has for the herbs, the fact that he's 82 and is still discovering and exploring so much because it's something that you could study for a lifetime and still not extinguish all there is to know. So, yeah, he's driven by passion, I think.

**Speaker A** (03:10): Absolutely. And he's, excuse me, like, like Dr. Pete. People that listen to Dr. Pete can clearly hear. He's very, excuse me, scientifically grounded in what he's discussing. Although sometimes his explanation is different from what would be a typ. Understanding of it. And that's because he knows something different. Your father also, he's very much into the science in herbal medicine, isn't he?

**Speaker C** (03:35): Oh, he's really into the science. I mean, he spends his life, I mean, when he's not actually physically preparing herbs or seeing patients or working his dispensary, he's. He's researching. He spends lots and lots of time researching still. Yeah. And he loves that.

**Speaker A** (03:49): Now, am I right, Am I right in thinking that he. I don't know for how long, but he came to America working for a Utah company, developing some products for them.

**Speaker C** (03:59): Yeah. So he used to tour America giving lectures on herbal applications for cosmetics. And he's worked for a few network marketing companies, designing herbal products for them and supplements and encapsulating them and making them work for a large scale company.

**Speaker A** (04:18): Yeah. Do you know how long that was again, he spent?

**Speaker C** (04:21): How well I know that he. How long ago was that?

**Speaker A** (04:25): How many years he'd been doing this for?

**Speaker C** (04:26): Well, I think it must have stretched over about 10 years.

**Speaker A** (04:29): Yeah. Okay, good. So, Sophie, Winter coughs, colds, preparations are some favorites. Let's get an idea of what it was, what it was like growing up in a household on the northernmost tip of Scotland with an herbalist as a father.

**Speaker C** (04:47): Okay, well, so I have three sisters, there's four of us daughters together. So when you have four young children growing up, typically speaking, young children develop cough and chest infections. And that was definitely the case with us. It may have been made worse by the fact that we're growing up in the most. We're on the top of the map of the uk. So our home looks over the Orkney Islands right at the very top. But really, really incredible herbs grow locally and are very specific to this area. So we, we have an agar in the kitchen. And my childhood memories are full of herbs drying on top and syrups being made at the side of the agar. And yeah, so we all actually had whooping cough as children, all four of us, I believe sister, my eldest sister had it the worst. And what dad did for her and he did for all of us, was he sliced up thin slices of garlic, smeared the soles of her feet with Vaseline and applied thin slices of garlic to the soles of her feet and wrapped around cling film and applied a sock. He would have left it on for a few minutes. I'm not sure how long, because obviously after a time, garlic can actually burn, so you don't want to leave it on for too long. But, you know, within a few minutes, the essential oils have gone up, the volatile oils have gone up through the bloodstream and you're breathing out garlic. And that's what shortened the duration and severity of our whooping cough children. We used to pick Tocilago coltsfoot and it makes the most incredible syrup because the flowers themselves smell of honey. But by the side of the Argo, we'd do a layer of. And I would. I mean, all four of us were lured out to the hills and to the sand dunes and moors picking herbs, or lured out by a quarter of a Snicker bar each, because in those days we weren't given chocolate. And we'd pick sackfuls of these herbs and we'd go home. We'd do a layer of flowers, layer of sugar, a layer of flowers. They'd macerate by the side of the hot agar and we'd have the most incredible syrup. And one of the things my dad is most well known for is he makes an incredible thyme syrup. And thyme. I mean, thyme as a herb fits the need of the lungs like a glove. It's an antitussive, so it reduces the cough reflex. It's anti oedema on the lungs. When you get swelling of the lungs, it's expectorant, helps you spit out the mucus and it's antiseptic. And he makes an incredible syrup using de cide water, which in itself is a healing water, and molasses.

**Speaker A** (07:08): That's interesting, actually. Your father actually uses a specific water. I think you should speak about that for a little bit.

**Speaker C** (07:15): Well, all of his extracts are made use. All of his extracts are made using Deeside water. Now, Deeside, Deeside is a well or a spring which comes from the penanic hills around Aberdeenshire, I believe. My dad actually worked as a consultant for this water company because he understands water very well. And that water is not just water. Different waters have different values and properties. Because my dad's also an engineer before he was a herbalist, and he's very scientific and so people. So the royalties, Royal family, Used to travel to this area of Scotland to drink the healing water, these Deeside water. And my dad actually extracts all of his herbs in this Deeside water.

**Speaker A** (07:55): How far away? Because your home is up in a place called Thurso, which is the very northernmost point point of Scotland.

**Speaker C** (08:03): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (08:04): How far away is D side from Thorazzone?

**Speaker C** (08:07): So it'd be about a five hour drive south.

**Speaker A** (08:08): Five hours.

**Speaker D** (08:09): Okay.

**Speaker A** (08:10): All right, good. Well, you're listening to ask your robe, Dr. Kami D. Garberville, 91.1 FM from 7:30 until 8:00'. Clock. Listeners are invited to call in with questions, any questions they might want to pose. Sophie as well as Dr. Pete who is on the line and is going to be joining us and interjecting and we're going to be questioning him about some of the science, about some of these things that Sophie's going to talk about. I did want to say that a little bit of the background, just for people that are listening. In terms of England's law and herbal medicine and it being protected. In 1154, Henry II institutionalized common law. And it's been the basis of the legal systems of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland, plus many other countries around the world until the present time. And common law is based on the premise that everything is legal unless it's deemed illegal. Pretty straightforward, huh? Now herbal medicine throughout history has always been protected under common law. However, in 1542 the medical profession at that time wanted to prevent herbalists from practicing. Fortunately, Henry viii, as an avid user of herbs, came to the rescue and implemented the Herbalist charter which underpinned the herbalists right to practice and anyone with knowledge of herbs could continue to use them. Quoting from the text that at all time from henceforth it shall be lawful to every person being the king subject, having knowledge and experience of the nature of herbs, roots and waters. And Nicholas Culpepper in 1616-1654 was an apothecary who lived in a time when fees paid or charged by the medical professionals were out of the reach of the general public. So Culpepper translated the medical text from Latin to English and sold copies at a low price to the apothecaries and anyone who could read so that they could use his life saving works. Henry VIII and Culpepper saved herbal medicine for the people. And thanks to the work in England of Fred Fletcher Hyde and other herbalists, the 1968 Medicines act allowed herbalists to continue to prescribe and prepare herbal medicines under Section 12, Part 1 and Section 12, Part 2, of this Act. However, with the current relationship with the European Union, European law is now having a profound influence on the daily lives of herbalists, including the jurisdiction of herbal medicine. European law is founded on Napoleonic law, not common law. And Napoleonic law is based on the premise that everything is illegal unless it's deemed legal. So, completely back to front. Anyway, I know that the. The National Institute of Medical herbalists is still working fairly tirelessly to keep the practice out of the reach of exclusion from the Brussels establishment. And I think you're probably. You're a member of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, aren't you?

**Speaker C** (11:04): No.

**Speaker A** (11:05): Mcpp. Right. Okay. In England, there's two authoritative bodies on herbal medicine. The national Institute of Medical herbalists, which I think is founded in 1864, and then the College of practicing phytotherapists, which actually is probably more allied to the European escop, the European Society on pharmacopoeia. Yeah, good. Okay. So again then, this mirrors the kind of restriction and influence one system of medicine has against another, Limiting freedom of choice to the patient. We're not quite there, both in the UK and the US but as we've mentioned many times in past shows here on Camuhouse, the overreaching corporations, in tandem with government and lobbyists, are seeking to eliminate any competition in favor of monopoly in the hands of the pharmaceutical medical industries. It's only by the power of we the people speaking out against any restrictive legislation that this will be avoided. A good example is the current legislation now forcing vaccination on the people, using the law to monopolize profits in the name of the greater good, when the very industry producing vaccines is indemnified by law against punitive damages. When individuals are crippled or killed by adverse drug events, many of which are clearly identified as the adjuvants within vaccines, like aluminum, for example. It's one thing to produce safe, effective vaccines and quite another to manufacture drugs which have been linked to autism and other neurological impairment. We have spoken about this at a Fairly good length, Dr. Pete. On the subject of autism, I wanted to ask Sophie the same question afterwards and then get your feedback about the answer that she's gonna have, which I haven't really asked her at this point. I'm not too sure what she's going to say, and I definitely don't know what you're going to say. But what do you see as a safe approach to helping the autistic child? And what do you see as a cause?

**Speaker B** (13:01): I think just about anything harmful to the parents, especially the mother and especially during pregnancy, almost any environmental harm is going to increase the rate of autism. For example, environmental estrogens and things that cause hypothyroidism, things that cause obesity are known to be causes of autism. But I think, for example, in Texas, there was a study showing that Latino kids, especially Mexican immigrants, had a much lower rate of autism than the well medicalized white residents. And I think a major cause of a major source of adversity during pregnancy is what John Goffman saw was the major cause of breast cancer and heart disease in the United States, namely medical radiation or medicalization in general. In the case of autism, including too many X ray exams for the mother, too many treatments in general, including bad thyroid therapy, bad endocrine therapy and use of many toxic drugs. And touching has been identified as one of the things that makes kids emotional system and nervous system develop properly. And there has been kind of a culture of ignoring the babies in the standard American culture. And in Latinos, they are very touchy compared to the Anglo population. So I think there are lots of causes and enriching the environment, removing toxins and improving the thyroid and progesterone of the person's system. All of the endocrine system can be modified and improved to remedy, to some extent, at least, the autistic.

**Speaker A** (15:29): Okay, Sophie, I wanted to ask you this, the same kind of thing and then anecdotal evidence.

**Speaker C** (15:37): Yeah. I have a couple of friends whose children have been quite severely autistic at some point. And these, my friends have actually been incredibly dedicated. They've been very dedicated mothers, but they've been very dedicated to bringing their children on as far as they can to help to incorporate them into mainstream education and just have a better hope for their futures. And they've done a really great job of this. And they've definitely focused on their diets and on their gut health. Because with both of these children, I can think of their digestive habits or their bowel motions have been disturbed. And one friend I can think of in particular, when her autistic son used to go into what's called stimming, which is repetitive physical movements like jumping up and down on the spot and acting kind of more hyperactively and less responsive to his mother. She used to visit a pediatrician, and this pediatrician used to prescribe her son a strong antifungal because it was suspected that he had a huge fungal overgrowth, which is almost creating an alcoholic syndrome, or he was producing a lot of alcohol in his system. And the antifungals would Hugely modify his behavior and help him take him on in leaps and bounds.

**Speaker A** (16:59): Dr. Pete, what do you think about that? The presence of gut organisms that metabolize carbohydrates producing ethanol and how that could impact.

**Speaker B** (17:11): Yeah, the intestinal flora produce lots of toxins, but the yeast in particular produce both alcohol and estrogen. And the estrogen is, I think, more toxic than the alcohol.

**Speaker A** (17:29): Okay, there you go. Okay, Sophie, sleep disturbance then. And it's a very common presentation that I think a lot of herbalists get consulted about. Do you see many people with insomnia or other disturbances in sleep? And what do you treat this with?

**Speaker C** (17:48): Well, I do now because I've been sort of spoken about as a bit of a sleep expert, but I have to thank Dr. Pete for that. I was an eight year insomniac, a rather severe insomniac. It was extremely depressing and debilitating condition and situation to be in for such a long period of time. And when I rehooked up and managed to speak to Sarah, your wife, and you about it properly, you taught me about how Dr. Pete views insomnia. And then I started to learn the actual genuine, the true physiological approach to insomnia was that if you can get your stress hormones down, you're most likely going to sleep with. Well, I was a chronic undereater, not intentionally necessarily, but because when you're chronically stressed, you have a chronically depressed appetite. So I would say I was a chronic undereater or chronically calorie deficit. And then I started to learn about sugars, about carbohydrates, about the right types of sugars to lay down as glycogen, that if we're really healthy enough, our thyroid is helping us lay down glycogen, we should be able to, a healthy individual should be able to get an eight hour sleep because that eight hour glycogen store feeds our active brain through the night. And a very, very key point of understanding insomnia is to understand first of all that sleep is an active process. It is not a passive process. Our brain does a huge amount of repair. Our brain shrinks and we go into a deep rinse cycle. It's a very active process. And Dr. Pete might want to correct me on this. I think that the brain uses about 100 grams of glucose through the night. So obviously, and apparently to energize that active process of heal, we need to supply the brain with glucose. And if we've not laid down enough glycogen during the day to sleep well at Night for our brain to be able to get dip into that reserve, we're going to get a rise in stress hormones which will catabolize our fat and our muscle to deliver the energy for the brain. But of course, a side effect of stress hormones, or cortisol and adrenaline, is mental alertness, which you don't want at night. So you've got to view insomnia actually as a daytime disorder which is presenting itself at night.

**Speaker A** (19:59): Dr. P. What do you speak to in terms of the liver's ability to store glycogen and any impairment in that which would trigger insomnia?

**Speaker B** (20:08): Thyroid is the essential thing for being able to store glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver in particular. But the muscles are a major reservoir too, besides the liver. And the brain itself stores when conditions are good, stores quite a bit of glycogen locally. And when you run out of glycogen in your brain muscles and liver, you mobilize free fatty acids out of stores. And the free fatty acids condition create the condition of diabetes in the brain as well as throughout the body. It turns off brain metabolism by essentially poisoning the mitochondria, blocking the ability to use any glucose that your body produces by breaking down protein with the stress hormones.

**Speaker A** (21:06): Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker C** (21:08): So in the UK and I'm sure in America, well, it's the same. We're under this impossible situation where we're all told to keep carbohydrates and avoid sugar, and some particularly health conscious mothers even try and avoid fructose. And fruits for the children, especially fruit juice, and adults are avoiding salt. And you've got a perfect storm for insomnia. So first of all, if I have a patient with insomnia, the first place I look at is diet, and the second place I look is herbs.

**Speaker A** (21:32): There you go. All right. So, Sophie, getting back to the kind of foundation of your background, you know, with your father being a noblest, I. Did you say that it was three or four. Three or four generations that he was.

**Speaker C** (21:47): Well, I know it goes back about 200 years. I'm pretty sure it's four generations, but it's on my TED Talk.

**Speaker A** (21:52): Okay, Right, there you go. Well, let's, let's talk about that very briefly then. Your, your TED Talk. I think everybody who's listening has probably heard of TED Talks now. They do them in all sorts of different countries and they a wide range of subjects. So tell us a little bit about your TED Talk, what you did and where it was and how.

**Speaker C** (22:09): Well, I gave a TED Talk with my sister Naomi, and the title was why We Are Dependent on Plants for Medicine. We were given an opportunity to do a TED Talk, and I felt the most important thing for me as a herbalist anyway was to reconnect and, you know, reconnect the dots of people. People often think that herbs are some kind of archaic system or even something to be degraded, like, you know, as witchcraft or something. Whereas actually it forms a bedrock of our most important medicine. So the medicines on the essential medicines list of the World Health Organization, a significant proportion of that those drugs are based on herbs. And we would not have those herbs if it weren't for the discoveries in plants.

**Speaker A** (22:50): So what do you. What comes to your mind when you.

**Speaker C** (22:52): Well, the most. Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is morphine, because, I mean, if you think about what people have gone through with the Second World War, I'm not sure if it was available in the First World War. It's tended to the wounds and grotesque injuries of wars. There's nothing that rivals morphine still as an analgesic. Then you think about the lidocaine, Novocaine, that was discovered from coca leaves. Then I think about aspirin, which I love. You think about the diabetes medicine from Galliga. What is that? I can't remember the name of that term. Metformin.

**Speaker A** (23:24): Yeah.

**Speaker C** (23:25): So metformin that has its origins in goats. Ray, you think about 90% of our chemotherapeutic drugs have their foundations in plants and natural. Yeah. Taxol, from the European New Tree, and Vinca, Vinblastine, greater periwinkle. I mean, so I feel that for me personally, it's very important to get that message out there that you look out to the fields and you're walking past essential medicines.

**Speaker D** (23:50): Right.

**Speaker A** (23:50): And I think, again, I know when.

**Speaker B** (23:52): We.

**Speaker A** (23:54): Were discussing the outline of the show on the way in, because you didn't. You didn't. You didn't show back up again. You've been out all day long. But basically, I drew up a guideline here of questions and answers and things that I wanted to get Dr. Pete's perspective on. I know that you have. How long have you been. Is it eight years or so? How long is it you discovered that sugar was. Wasn't bad for you and the whole thing turned around Eight years. Eight years ago. Right. So quickly talk to me about how you implement what you've learned from Dr. Pete and everything that Sarah would have discussed with you, because I know you two are in dialogue pretty constantly by email, going backwards and forwards with different patients and talking about them and how, you know, the success and what to do next and all the rest of it.

**Speaker C** (24:34): How I implement personally.

**Speaker A** (24:36): Yeah, yeah. As a herbalist, a daughter of an herbalist of 200 year old succession of people that are doctors, you know, herbal medicine was your be all.

**Speaker C** (24:49): Yeah, it was.

**Speaker A** (24:50): Okay. And I think I'm fair in saying that there is no one modality to cure any body. It's a multi, multi complex situation. So whether it's herbs, whether it's certain chemicals that, you know, drugs that are very helpful, whether it's, you know, red light, whether it's sound, whether it's, you know, there's many different modalities that can really be brought together by a good practitioner to get the best result possible. And when you were practicing, obviously you would have got your knowledge from the same course, the same university and obviously from the whole background of your father having grown up in it since you were born. Tell me some of the differences perhaps, or some, maybe some of the cases that you've come to and maybe hit a wall after which treating and looking at a different angle to it or using a different, you know, compound in conjunction with herbs, with or without how that's changed your practice?

**Speaker C** (25:56): Oh, how it changed my practice. Okay. Well, now what I do with my patients is I help them remove the good and bad tags they have all over all sorts of foods because they're often very misplaced. And the problem with that, what that does is it stops them eating bad tags.

**Speaker A** (26:10): You mean like brainwashing?

**Speaker C** (26:11): That's associated with, well, you know, sugar's bad.

**Speaker A** (26:14): Salt's bad.

**Speaker C** (26:15): Yeah, sugar's bad, salt's bad. Vegetable oil good, margarine good, butter bad. All that kind of stuff. Because actually what that's done, I think one of the worst things that that's done is it's removed people's instinctive eating, instinctive, you know, leading of how they eat. You know, they may well be hungry and they may well be craving salt but still resisting that desire to eat salt. And the same with sugar and you know, not so much protein because that doesn't have that bad tag attached to it. But they're denying themselves their basic physiological needs because they have this perception that food is as bad. And I think that's one of the worst things that's come out of it.

**Speaker A** (26:51): Dr. Pete, what have you got to say about that in terms of sugar and salt and what you believe is the kind of undoing of the instinctual craving for it?

**Speaker B** (27:03): Oh, those doctrines against them were distinctly created by the pharmaceutical industry. When they came out with new diuretics around 1950, they convinced doctors that pregnant women had to use them because it would prevent weight gain and water retention in pregnancy and just absolute confabulation, making up diseases that didn't exist so they could sell their product. And in the process, they destroyed many, many pregnancies in the United States with their salt restriction plus diuretics. And the sugar thing appeared around the same time with the marketing of the polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Those were defined as essential, and so the food industry first promoted them as medicinal in great quantity, a hundred times more than any possible theoretical essentiality would indicate. But they, they were promoted to lower cholesterol. But then a doctor showed that sugar raises cholesterol. And so the food industry created the cholesterol myth to sell their polyunsaturated oils and then to explain away heart disease and the elevated cholesterol, which really is the result of hypothyroidism, almost all of it. The ban on sugar to lower prevent heart disease was promoted all through the 60s and 70s. Again, the insulin industry and the drug alternatives to insulin were promoted along with basically a sugar free diet teaching people that sugar causes diabetes.

**Speaker D** (29:41): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (29:42): And then again, of course, there's a whole sugar feeds cancer misdirection. Sophie, what are you. What are fish oils doing in Europe and in England now? How do you get. I mean, are they still really advertised as really healthful? And your patients are always talking about how good fish oils are? You probably set them right. But what do you think the general current thinking is?

**Speaker C** (30:03): Yeah, I tend to steer them away, but the buoyant. Definitely still very buoyant. But interestingly, last year a newspaper published a study linking fish oils with liver disease. I think actually scarring of the liver, as far as I remember. And I think that hit a mainstream newspaper last year in England.

**Speaker A** (30:25): I wonder. Dr. P, you probably have something to say about liver scarring and fish oil consumption from a physiological perspective or even an anecdotal perspective.

**Speaker B** (30:38): Yeah, lots of stresses contribute, but definitely not good foods like saturated fats and sugar.

**Speaker A** (30:47): Okay. All right, you're listening to ask your Dr. KMU D. Garboval, 91.1 FM. From now until 8 o', clock, callers are invited to call in with any questions either for Dr. Pete and or Sophie. And the number, if you live in the area or if you live outside the area or outside the country is area code 707-923-3911. So that's 707-923-391100. Questions anytime from now until 8. I think we have a caller on the line already. Caller, you're on the air. What's your name, where are you from and what's your question?

**Speaker E** (31:23): Jeff from Long Island.

**Speaker A** (31:24): Hey, Jeff.

**Speaker E** (31:26): I have two questions for Dr. Pete. One, the soils that plants are grown in obviously don't have the same minerals that they used to, as we all know. And there's a couple of products that have gotten a lot of attention. Fulvic and humic acids, which apparently are coming from, you know, rock formations that are, you know, very old. Are you familiar with those? Whether the enzymes and the natural minerals associated with those are complementary and beneficial in any way?

**Speaker B** (32:05): No, I think they're mildly harmful because to the extent that they break down, they can be absorbed and release toxic things. Any minerals, such as micro, magnesium and trace minerals would be beneficial, but the substance fulvic acid and humic acid are not in themselves safe.

**Speaker E** (32:36): Okay, are there studies on that or is that just that you're aware of, or is that just a gut feel that you have, or is that something you've done research on in the past or.

**Speaker B** (32:45): No, you can find articles on Pub mail.

**Speaker E** (32:51): Yeah, the articles I found have all been actually favorable. And the reason I mention it and I'm pushing a little bit is because I am actually the same person who told you that I had a skin rash on the insides of my armpits and elbows for literally it was. Went on for 12 months. I mean, literally 12 months. They told me to take cortisone, which I didn't want to do. So the suggestions you to refresh were, you know, taking the salt baths with baking soda, which I think was very helpful. CO2, I think you mentioned vitamin D. And so I did some of that stuff and it was very helpful. But I must say I believe the fulvic and humic acids, which I took more recently, have actually improved the assimilation and the enzymatic absorption of oil, all nutrients that I consume. I really do believe that it's actually. It's actually a lot of articles are very positive on it. Now, maybe there are some mixtures that are toxic relative to others, but I strong believer in that. But anyway, okay, so that's one I actually would love to see. If you write up on that and actually can reference specific articles that describe the damage that can be done by them, I'd be really curious, but I found in personal experience that it might just actually be the opposite. Anyway, the other Question I have relates to thyroid. I think at one point we discussed the fact that it's not compared to an adrenal gland, which apparently can repair itself on its own. The same is true of any gland, including the thyroid gland. But the bigger, more complicated issue I think we discussed was it's more important because pufa and other issues may affect the production, transport, conversion and uptake of T3 into the cell. And so I guess my question specifically is, if someone is improving their consumption, where the pufa is down, and therefore the uptake, transport and conversion is better, why isn't it possible to eliminate thyroid? It just seems to me that for some reason you're taking thyroid all the time, and if you're complying with a diet, it seems to me that the benefits of improvement of the adrenal gland should also apply to the thyroid gland. For somebody who's a strict proponent of your diet, where am I? What am I missing?

**Speaker B** (35:20): I've seen lots of people who either were able to stop their thyroid supplement or greatly reduce it. And that happens. One or two people, it happened in a week. They broke the pattern so quickly they didn't need it after having been in very serious condition. Others take three or four years, for example. A fat person who is, well, saturated with unsaturated fats has to get rid of a lot of that stored thyroid inhibiting fat before they can get away from a supplement.

**Speaker A** (36:04): What about all the electromagnetic radiation that's certainly disruptive to thyroid activity?

**Speaker B** (36:10): That's nothing to do with diet and the environmental estrogens. There are so many things like in tooth filling material, packaging of food. Just in almost any food, you'll get some of these estrogens which block the thyroid.

**Speaker A** (36:32): All right, well, thank you. Thank you for your call, Andrew.

**Speaker E** (36:35): One other question that you just raised.

**Speaker A** (36:37): I do have a couple of other.

**Speaker E** (36:38): People, if I can. So you mentioned red light earlier, and I just wanted to understand in Dr. Pete's mind, the benefits of red light. What does it physiologically do relative to the CO2, whether it's CO2 through, you know, putting yourself in a bag or putting yourself in a tub, what is it? Actually, the CO2 itself, I understand, lowers or stops any production of nitric oxide. And what does the red light do? Because they're different benefits, are they not?

**Speaker B** (37:10): Yeah, very different. Red light has a variety of effects, all involving action on electrons which are out of their normal condition or orbit, especially cytochrome oxidase, copper enzyme, the blue enzyme of the crucial enzyme of oxidative metabolism. Stress lowers that activity just going through the night, it lowers its ability to oxidize nutrients. And just a few minutes of exposure to red light will restore the electronic balance of the copper and restore the copper to relation to the enzyme activating the enzyme. But there are a lot of other effects related to inflammation. For example, radiation poisoning at a lethal dose can be neutralized to the point that the animal will survive by exposing within the first hour or so to red light following the X ray or gamma radiation.

**Speaker A** (38:28): Excellent, Dr. Pete, really appreciate your reply there. We do have two other callers, so I don't mean to rush you, but let's make sure these other callers get their calls in and anybody else listening, it's ask your rev, Dr. Kmudgal, 91.1 FM from now until 8 o'.

**Speaker B** (38:44): Clock.

**Speaker A** (38:44): Oh, there goes the lights. I think with three callers. 707-923-3911. Okay, let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where you from?

**Speaker E** (38:57): From Portland, Oregon.

**Speaker A** (38:59): Portland, Oregon. Yeah, go ahead. What's your question?

**Speaker E** (39:01): So one question is there's perhaps it's a fad, but what are the benefits of drinking 16 ounces of celery juice a day? Or is that just.

**Speaker A** (39:13): Sophie, you go ahead and.

**Speaker C** (39:15): Well, there's. Celery juicing is a real craze in the UK right now. Maybe it is here as well. So people, yeah, people are juicing about three whole heads and stems of celery juice each morning. I don't know specifically what it is, but I think there's a huge amount of minerals in there, including potassium. And people do seem to feel much better on it and lose some water retention.

**Speaker A** (39:38): Okay. Dr. Pete, what do you know about celery juice and its, its activity? I know celery seed is definitely used in the treatment of gout as a waste clearing mechanism for the kidneys. But do you know much about celery juicing?

**Speaker B** (39:57): I think the main problem is that quite a few people are allergic to it.

**Speaker A** (40:02): All right. Okay.

**Speaker E** (40:05): Can I ask one?

**Speaker A** (40:07): Yep, go ahead quickly.

**Speaker E** (40:09): So, Dr. Pete, how much sugar do you consume a day and what are the ways that you get it? Is it white sugar and fruit juice or.

**Speaker B** (40:20): I try to get it all from fruit, but when I don't have good fruit, then I fill in with quite refined sugar and I try to get more than half of my calories from sugar.

**Speaker A** (40:39): There you go.

**Speaker E** (40:41): So like a thousand calories?

**Speaker B** (40:43): Oh no, more like 15, 1600. Oh yeah.

**Speaker A** (40:48): Okay. Yeah. I was going to say when you're when you're thinking and you're processing information and you're sitting on the computer and you're researching stuff and answering calls, the brain is very hungry. Okay, next caller, you're on the air. Where you're from, what's your question?

**Speaker F** (41:05): Hi, I'm from Australia. My question is I've had some blood tests done recently and my circulating iron is fine, but my iron, my ferritin is actually quite low and I've been eating a thyroid supportive diet for over 12 months now. And following a lot of your methods, Dr. Pete, but the doctor's suggesting that I should have some iron injections. When I eat my red meat, I have that with orange juice to try and increase the absorption, but still it's quite low. I'm just wondering whether I should have those injections or if there's another method that I can use to increase iron level.

**Speaker B** (41:50): How was the iron measured?

**Speaker F** (41:52): As the first it was blood test. There was a. Ferritin was 6 micrograms per liter. Fasting blood.

**Speaker G** (42:05): Sorry, sorry.

**Speaker B** (42:07): Was the saturation of transferring. Was that one of.

**Speaker A** (42:11): Sorry, iron saturation? Did you have your. Yeah, transferring saturation done?

**Speaker F** (42:16): Yes, three and a half grams per litre.

**Speaker B** (42:20): What was the percentage?

**Speaker A** (42:22): Three and a half grams per litre?

**Speaker F** (42:24): Yes.

**Speaker B** (42:25): No, I mean the percentage of the saturation.

**Speaker F** (42:27): They haven't given a percentage.

**Speaker G** (42:32): The results I've got, I've just got.

**Speaker F** (42:33): Three and a half mil grams per litre.

**Speaker B** (42:38): Oh, that would be hemoglobin, wouldn't it?

**Speaker F** (42:44): Well, it says transferritin and then it's got TIBC of 76 micro millimoles per liter, saturation 10 ferritin 6, iron 7.8. We might use different measures here.

**Speaker A** (43:06): Well, Dr. Pete, your rationale for increase increasing. I know, I know you're always wary about increasing iron as it's extremely reactive and powerful oxidant, but in terms, in, in terms of what the. The lady is talking about, having done those things dietarily, what would, what would be another step, so far as your perspective is concerned, for raising the. This lady's iron and her hemoglobin are getting her saturation back up.

**Speaker B** (43:39): The hemoglobin depends on body temperature. For one thing. Thyroid is required for absorbing copper from your diet and the copper is needed for integrating the iron with the blood with the heme and getting your waking temperature up to close to normal, close to 98 degrees at waking and 98,6 during the day and making sure that your arms and legs are warm close to your body temperature. It's possible to have a normal oral Temperature and still have very cold feet. And the blood is made in your long bones so they have to be warm. And thyroid is the main factor keeping the blood synthesis going and the copper absorption to use the iron. And you can get a very high intake of iron in a safe way if you eat some liver and eggs every day and have orange juice with it.

**Speaker F** (44:59): Okay. I am having liver about 200 grams per week. I have probably two eggs every second day. I also my rising temperature is usually around 36. I don't know the conversion to Fahrenheit or to Fahrenheit, so I'm not sure. But I am doing all those things to improve.

**Speaker G** (45:28): But my stores are still low 12.

**Speaker F** (45:29): Months later, so there's nothing else I can do. You wouldn't recommend having the iron injections?

**Speaker B** (45:38): If your iron saturation is down around 5% or lower, then that might justify. Have you tried oral supplements?

**Speaker F** (45:51): I haven't at this stage.

**Speaker B** (45:56): Who had such terrible effects from iron injections that I think would be. If you're seriously low in saturation, then I think the first thing would be if the liver and eggs haven't worked. And oysters are another very good source.

**Speaker F** (46:14): I have those as well, Sophie. I have those as well.

**Speaker A** (46:18): How about from herbal perspective, Sophie? Because I know you've dealt with this before.

**Speaker C** (46:22): Well, traditionally speaking to strengthen the blood, but I've also seen in practice nettle can help.

**Speaker A** (46:29): This is regular stinging nettle and is an infusion. Or are you talking about.

**Speaker C** (46:35): And then also blackstrap molasses, but that also is because it has iron content and I think also has copper. But blackstrap molasses daily and nettle tea, you know, strong nettle tea might help because I suppose the fear is if you have a hemorrhage or if you have an accident, your stores aren't there.

**Speaker A** (46:51): Okay, we do have three other callers. I don't want to thank you for your time. I thank you for calling in. But we've got three more. So let's get the next one call away from. What's your question?

**Speaker E** (47:00): Hi, I'm from Texas. I had two questions for Dr. Pete.

**Speaker A** (47:03): Okay, make them quick. Dr. Pete, if we can make your responses fairly quick, these next couple of people will get a chance to ask a question too, before 8 o'. Clock.

**Speaker B** (47:13): Yeah.

**Speaker E** (47:13): So first, what can be done for someone who has a high temperature and pulse but still has chronic fatigue and other hypothyroid symptoms?

**Speaker A** (47:22): Right. Okay. From adrenaline perspective, Dr. Pete, somebody with a high waking temperature and still has lethargy.

**Speaker B** (47:31): Checking your vitamin D level and your calcium intake. Those support your thyroid function and their magnesium and calcium are necessary for the thyroid to work. Right.

**Speaker A** (47:50): And you would equate that waking temperature to be an adrenaline based stress hormone dominated physiology?

**Speaker B** (47:56): Yeah, you should check your pulse rate and same at the same time as your waking temperature, but also about 10 or 11 o' clock in the morning and if your temperature is steady even after you've had some carbohydrate, fruit juice and such, then it might be something other than high adrenaline.

**Speaker A** (48:23): Okay, and what was your second question, Cora?

**Speaker E** (48:26): Yeah, I was wondering if you've heard of chlorine dioxide and if you think it would help for reductive stress issues like autistic symptoms. I think there are just things like that.

**Speaker B** (48:38): There are lots of antiseptic agents that are safer than that. It isn't especially dangerous, but long time use could promote cancer. Things like food, fibers, any kind of fibrous food that goes through you without causing inflammation or gas will help to disinfect your intestine.

**Speaker A** (49:05): And Sophie, you wanted to interject here, so.

**Speaker C** (49:08): Yeah. I personally had experienced brain irritation myself in the past and I've definitely linked it to my gut. And one of the things I've used for patients in the past and for myself also is a herb called cat's claw which is very anti inflammatory on the gut and you know, antimicrobial, etc. But it's also, I believe got some research for brain inflammation too.

**Speaker A** (49:27): Excellent. Okay, so let's get this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where you from? What's your question?

**Speaker G** (49:35): Is that me?

**Speaker A** (49:35): Yeah, that's you. Go ahead, what's your question? Where are you from?

**Speaker G** (49:38): I'm from the Garberville area.

**Speaker A** (49:39): Okay.

**Speaker G** (49:40): And I'm calling because this is a very pertinent show for me. I'm nearly seven months pregnant with my first child.

**Speaker A** (49:47): Okay.

**Speaker G** (49:48): And we're choosing to go a very natural route. In our local paper here, the Independent, just Tuesday they published that there's a potential outbreak of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, in our area. There have been a few cases recorded so far this year. They're not labeling it as an outbreak yet, but I had a couple of questions about the treatments recommended by Sophie with the garlic and the thyme syrup. Are those safe enough and recommended to be safe enough for small children, infants. Also, is the thyme syrup meant to be made from fresh thyme or dried thyme? And it's Sophie wouldn't mind repeating those four wonderfully useful Things that the thyme.

**Speaker B** (50:35): Syrup does that's helpful with whooping cough. Thank you.

**Speaker C** (50:38): Yeah, of course. So thyme syrup is usually made from dried thyme. And the four actions of thyme are. It's antitussive, reduces the cough reflex. It's expectorant. It helps you cough the phlegm up. It's antiseptic, and it's also anti. Anti edema. So it reduces swelling in the airways, too.

**Speaker G** (51:00): That's wonderful. Do you think it's safe enough to use on very small children?

**Speaker C** (51:05): Well, I used it on my son from. I mean, to be honest with you, with my son, I happily gave it to him for about six months onward. And if he had a need, I possibly would. I possibly would have given it to him earlier, too, but in much, much reduced doses. I mean, you may be able to give drop doses, juices even.

**Speaker D** (51:23): Okay, good.

**Speaker G** (51:24): Thank you. And do you think the garlic sounds fairly innocuous to try something like that on a small child as well?

**Speaker C** (51:30): It is innocuous. You just don't want to leave it on for so long that it burns.

**Speaker G** (51:34): Right, Very quickly.

**Speaker C** (51:35): Well, maybe a couple of minutes.

**Speaker D** (51:37): Actually, I heard a trick to keep it from burning is peel it without actually damaging the skin. And the trick I heard was to put it in a sock against the infant's foot and just over night. But if you break the actual skin of the bulb, then that oil comes out and it burns great. Very, very gentle peeling.

**Speaker C** (51:55): Yeah. Okay, Lovely.

**Speaker G** (51:56): Peeled whole clove of garlic. Not like sliced clove of garlic.

**Speaker D** (52:00): Yeah. Because the oil was more irritating. That's just a trick I'd heard. I don't have a nickname.

**Speaker C** (52:05): Yeah.

**Speaker D** (52:06): I've tried it on myself, though, and it is very, very different. You can hold that clove against you for all day.

**Speaker C** (52:10): Right. That's great.

**Speaker A** (52:12): Okay. Dr. Pete, do you want to quickly say anything about whooping cough?

**Speaker B** (52:17): No, I haven't had any experience with it.

**Speaker A** (52:19): Okay. All right. Is that. Is that the call we've got through the callers? Okay, so.

**Speaker C** (52:23): Yes.

**Speaker G** (52:24): Thank you so much.

**Speaker A** (52:25): You're very welcome. Anybody else? Have you got any calls? You can quickly squeak in a quick one between now and 8 o', clock, but I want to have a few minutes here. Okay. The engineer shaking his head, going, no, no, no. Okay, let's just. Let's just leave it the way it is and appreciate people calling in. Always adds interest to the show and very grateful for the acknowledgment that people are listening, even though sometimes we have the shows and we don't get Too many callers. But as always I keep saying that these things are recorded in posterity and you know, they're on the Internet and they're on YouTube. And I'm going to be speaking with Dr. Pete about something to do about making sure the evidence and the information information is actually correct. So Dr. Pete, let me just thank you very much for your time again this month. We really appreciate it and I'm going to give out some information about you right away.

**Speaker B** (53:15): Okay, thanks.

**Speaker A** (53:16): Thank you. Okay, so people have listened to the show. Dr. Pete's website is www.raypeat.com. he's got plenty of articles there. He's been doing this for 40 plus years. And Sophie lam medical herbalists or medical herbalist from England. Sorry Scotland, not England from Scotland. Gosh, you're like a. Probably a fifth generation or six, six generation herbalist. Anyway, it's alive and well in Scotland and your dad's 82. He's been doing this for a long time and he is very much alive and well doing it.

**Speaker C** (53:50): Yeah.

**Speaker A** (53:51): And if you've got any wave of people to reach you, perhaps you might want to share with people.

**Speaker C** (53:56): Yeah. Well my, my sleep specific site is called don counting sheep.com so d o n e counting sheep.com that's dedicated to sleep. I also have my own website which.

**Speaker A** (54:09): Is sophielam.com sophie lamb.com and you're a member of the college of Practicing Phytotherapists CPP in England. Very good. Okay. Okay. So for those people that have tuned in appreciate you calling. I can be reached Monday through Friday. Any other time I guess really because it's toll free number and I may not answer the phone but leave a message. I will always get back to you. I can email me andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com or 1-888-WBME herb and as I said before on the last couple of shows we are intending to get a. What do you want to call it? An authoritative source of Dr. Pete's information. His tireless, tireless explanation. Scientifically so that people can see it for what it really is. And we love, we love to see real science in action. I am totally an advocate of scientifically backed medicine, herbal medicine, alternative medicines. There's no reason to ban any of it. Let's just be rational about this and produce good results for people. That's all we want to do is see people get better. So until the third Friday of next month. Actually you know what? I won't be here third Friday of next month. That's right. August, next month I will not be here. So it's going to be September, so I should need to need to check in with the studio about that. So get a replacement. But next month I will not be here, but back again in September, so until the third Friday of September. Wish you all good night and thanks for joining in.
