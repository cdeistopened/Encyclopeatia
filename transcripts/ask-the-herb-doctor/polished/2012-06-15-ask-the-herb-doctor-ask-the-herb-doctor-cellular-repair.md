## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome once again to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts.

You're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's loose subject of cellular repair. We're going to look into avoiding scarring, amongst other things. Once again, we have our very popular, ever-present scientist to share his views and opinions with us on this show, and that's Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi again.

**Andrew Murray:** For those people who perhaps have never listened to the show, if you would just give people a résumé of your background, that would be much appreciated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From 1968 to 1972, I studied mostly physiology and biochemistry at the University of Oregon and did my dissertation on age-related changes in the uterus—specifically oxidative changes. I found that estrogen and polyunsaturated fats tend to accumulate or increase in the tissues with aging and interfere with the use of oxygen. Since then, I've been working out the implications of that. The topic you mentioned derives from that subject.

## Fetal Development and Scarless Healing

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned oxidative changes in utero. I'd like you to open up with the parallels between the development that happens in utero—which happens without a scar—versus regular life. Once we are exposed to the things you'll bring out, scarring is pretty common. But there is definitely a way to do something about it, isn't there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the uterus, early in the development of the embryo, there's no blood supply. The cells are just absorbing oxygen, sugar, amino acids, and vitamins from their environment. Every time they divide, the environment for each new cell is different. The more cells there are, the more complex the environment is. If you happen to be next to a hungry cell, you won't get the same supply of oxygen and sugar. The changing shape as the embryo grows interacts with and modifies the supply of nutrients. So, the very shape that the embryo develops into is governed partly by the supplies that the mother can deliver to it.

**Andrew Murray:** Now, this relates to things like brain size or skull size?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For example, they knew in the 50s that if you lowered the blood sugar of a well-developed fetus using either estrogen or insulin, the brain cells would simply stop multiplying as long as the blood sugar was inadequate. If you take a chicken embryo in an egg, its brain stops growing exactly when the hen's provided glucose supply is used up. But if you open the egg and inject a little bit of glucose, the brain will start growing again, and the chicken will develop with a bigger brain than normal chickens ever had.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this is why it's so important for pregnant mothers to have optimal nutrition—it supports the brain development and growth of their baby to an optimal level.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. From month six to delivery, most of the brain cells develop. In fact, about half of the brain cells that are present at month six die off. That's how you can influence the size of the brain: by providing sugar. The more sugar there is, the fewer of those month-six brain cells will die off.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Maybe pregnant mothers need to just be hooked up to an IV of fructose.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you've mentioned in the past that fructose crosses the placenta like glucose, but it doesn't come back to the mother, so it stays trapped.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's what the baby wants, apparently, because it doesn't give any back.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Supposedly, it's very traditional in the Steiner philosophy that mothers should eat a lot of honey. Honey is very high in fructose.

## The Mechanism of Scarring vs. Regeneration

**Andrew Murray:** Let's look at the differences between scarring in adults when they are compromised by what they eat, and how in utero—with high levels of progesterone and the absence of polyunsaturated fats—scarring is virtually absent.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's no inflammation involved in repair in the fetus. If you remove some tissue in the fetus or embryo, the adjoining cells simply multiply and fill in with more cells. Apparently, you've left the available nutrient supply increased relatively by taking out some cells, so the neighboring cells have more and can simply grow faster and fill in the space.

In a mature animal, there are many things that interfere with that. The blood supply is interrupted if you have an injury, so the supply of sugar and oxygen is reduced. There are mechanisms to try to increase the delivery of sugar and oxygen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And this is a stress metabolism? It's your emergency backup if your body's not performing under ideal conditions.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Glucose is largely provided during stress by breaking down proteins. First, you use up what's stored as glycogen, but when that runs out, then you have to break down protein.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why it's important not to go longer than eight hours without eating, because you use up all of your glycogen in your liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The lack of oxygen—or the presence of lactic acid, which is produced by a lack of oxygen—turns on the production of a very simple protein that serves as supporting material, but also as a barrier substance. Cells that are injured put out this framework collagen material. But too much of that will increase the distance that oxygen and sugar have to travel to reach the cell. It can make the problem progressively worse the more a cell embeds itself in collagen as a result of the stress. You get more framework material but less functioning cellular material, and that's a scar.

Ideally, every tissue has to renew itself constantly, like your skin and your intestine. Everyone knows those are streaming from the stem cells at the bottom of the layer. Ideally, that's just a continuation of the development of cells in the embryo: they are fed, they multiply, expand, and complexify. But as things interfere with the ability to use energy or oxygen, the mature animal progressively moves into a generalized inflammatory state. It doesn't take a specific wound to turn on these cytokines, histamine, serotonin, and so on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which are all the backup stress signals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a generalized systemic stress starts turning these on in your fat cells, your liver, and every organ. That starts to shift the whole body in the same direction that scar formation goes. Your whole body loses vital functioning cells and replaces them with collagen—inert connective tissue. Old meat, for example, is tough because it's full of collagen. An old animal hide is thicker and tougher. Kid gloves are delicate, but mature goatskin is a thicker kind of leather. That happens in all of the tissues—progressive turning towards scar tissue type of function.

## Oxygen, Light, and Metabolism

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What types of processes inhibit the ideal use of oxygen and sugar in our bodies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thyroid is the basic thing. Thyroid activates the respiratory enzyme for which copper is the crucial cofactor. If you load up on iron, an excess of iron tends to displace this crucial copper. Anything that interferes with your thyroid function will also interfere with the functioning of this copper-containing enzyme. Too much darkness—not enough good light—reduces the activity of this enzyme.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people need to get lots of sunshine this summer. It's the red light that's regenerative and healing and helps your body use oxygen and sugar more efficiently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the absence of sunlight, if you just shine a very bright incandescent light on your tissues, within a few minutes the oxidative enzymes are activated and reduce stress.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA) and Diabetes

**Andrew Murray:** The concept of healing without scarring is pretty new to most people. You're saying that especially in the absence of PUFA—the polyunsaturates people consume from vegetable oils—the body can heal better. These oils have a very negative and inflammatory effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of the worst inflammatory agents are produced directly from the vegetable oil. Polyunsaturated fats, the Omega-6 class, form the prostaglandins.

**Andrew Murray:** Which are very pro-inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fetus is highly protected against those. People talking about the so-called "essential fatty acids" have noticed that human babies and calves are born in an extremely deficient state, they say. That's been used to sell the addition of fish oil to baby formula.

**Andrew Murray:** When actually it's completely the opposite—they don't need it and don't want it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The placenta protects the baby against those fats. The sugar that the baby does absorb makes the Omega-9 series, which are anti-inflammatory.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Humans haven't eaten these oils in such large quantities ever before until the 1920s. That's part of the reason why there are so many degenerative diseases, like the pancreatic damage that happens to the beta cells from excess Omega-6.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, could you illustrate the role of diabetes as an illustration of this stress reaction and the vicious cycle of inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anytime your blood sugar falls, that's a stress reaction. It first calls up adrenaline to move glycogen into the bloodstream, largely out of your liver. When you run out of stored glycogen and your blood sugar falls more, the adrenaline starts mobilizing free fatty acids out of your fat cells and other tissues. If you've incorporated a lot of polyunsaturated fats into your tissues, these free polyunsaturated fats interfere with sugar metabolism and signal more stress hormone production. They tell your brain that the stress is worse than it was.

**Andrew Murray:** So they have an intensifying effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, as opposed to the saturated fats which tend to inhibit the stress reaction. It's a self-limiting thing. If you've been a sugar or saturated fat eater and have a stress, you release the saturated fats which are anti-inflammatory and turn off the stress hormones.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just a detail for our listeners, Dr. Peat, can you explain which oils are included in these polyunsaturated fatty acids, otherwise known as PUFA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the things you see widely advertised: corn oil, canola, soybean oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, walnut oil.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Sesame oil, cottonseed oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Pancreatic Regeneration

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the American diet over the last 30 or 35 years, when diabetes and obesity have been increasing so much, polyunsaturated fats are the biggest increase in our diet, not sugar.

If you look at the nature of the pancreas, there's a constant renewal of the beta cells that produce insulin. The idea that once you're diabetic you're doomed because you don't have the cells is wrong. Studies show that glucose stimulates renewal of the beta cells in the pancreas.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So sugar helps a diabetic's pancreas regenerate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but since the polyunsaturated fats and the prostaglandins they form are toxic to the beta cells, if you don't have enough glucose, you'll just keep killing any beta cell that appears.

It happens that the stem cell flow moves from the glucagon-producing alpha cells to the beta cells as they mature. The alpha cells raise blood sugar. If you have a lot of alpha cells in proportion to beta cells, that will create apparent diabetes because the glucagon causes the breakdown of protein tissue and increases glucose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's like a stress reaction. The body is trying to save the lack of sugar by increasing glucagon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. If you have a lot of sugar supplied, you don't need the glucagon-producing cells, so they move on. Under the influence of sugar, the flow is increased and you produce the beta cells. The sugar should be holding down the stress and preventing the free fatty acids which would form the prostaglandins that kill the beta cells.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This is why you mentioned that study done in England where they gave diabetics sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They gave them 12 ounces a day of the highest quality white sugar. They stopped producing so much sugar in their urine as they were eating these huge amounts of sugar. As they stopped destroying their own tissues, they began gaining weight instead of losing weight.

## Stem Cells and Adrenal Fatigue

**Andrew Murray:** This moves on to the concept of cell streaming. You've mentioned Gershom Zajicek and the idea that there is a flowing of cells from one type to another.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's easiest to see in the liver. Zajicek demonstrated a flowing from the portal vein side of the lobule towards the center. But over 50 years ago, L.V. Polezhaev demonstrated that kind of renewal in muscle cells and even brain cells.

One of the current places where this is important is the idea of adrenal fatigue. It implies that stress causes the adrenals to die. But if the stress is moderate, the adrenal is very good at renewing itself. You can demonstrate the total renewal of the adrenal cortex by scooping out the contents. The cells of the inside of the fibrous capsule will multiply and, within about three months, produce a fully structured and new adrenal gland.

In the adrenal gland, the cells near the capsule produce aldosterone. As they mature and stream towards the center, they turn into a layer that produces cortisol. At the last stage, they produce the androgens and sex steroids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's amazing how one cell knows how to differentiate into all those different types.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress producing things, like serotonin or shock, turn on the activity of the layer that produces aldosterone. Aldosterone intensifies defensive stress reactions. If the organism can get past that shock stage with adequate sugar, then the glucocorticoids are produced, and finally the sex steroids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the sex steroids are the least important in emergency mode, but the most important in a healthy mode.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you are in this healthy state producing an abundance of progesterone and testosterone, these turn off the aldosterone production.

## Sugar and Wound Healing

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to bring out the point that in Africa, honey has been traditionally used to heal wounds effectively. You also mentioned that sugar can be packed into a wound to heal it properly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Africa, when there were no antibiotics available and they had to do chest surgery, they simply filled up the chest cavity with massive amounts of sugar. They discovered that it not only didn't get infected, but it healed basically without scarring. Packing a wound with sugar inhibits the formation of excess collagen and causes an almost scarless healing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Honey never goes bad, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Partly it's the osmolarity—it dehydrates things. But honey also has antimicrobial ingredients and fructose, which promotes actual healing instead of scar formation. Keeping the energy supply equal to the demand is what short-circuits the inflammation system. It goes right to repair, like the fetus.

## Toxemia, Salt, and Calcium

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to toxemia and preeclampsia. You've noted similarities between these conditions and aging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just about everything that happens to a woman in preeclampsia is similar to advanced aging symptoms: hypertension, nerve problems, liver malfunction, inflammatory processes. In the 1950s, Dr. Tom Brewer was shocked when he saw drug companies promoting diuretics to pregnant women to prevent edema. Doctors began advocating salt restriction.

Diuretics reduce blood volume. That tells the kidneys that you need more circulation. The kidneys signal with renin to activate the adrenals to produce more aldosterone to retain sodium. So when you cut down sodium, you make the adrenals produce more aldosterone to retain it.

**Andrew Murray:** Self-defeating.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Tom Brewer reviewed the evidence and showed that more salt was the cure to toxemia. He emphasized protein, plenty of salt, and calcium. Milk was the ideal protein because drinking two quarts of milk provides more than 2,000 milligrams of calcium. Calcium and sodium help turn off aldosterone. Aldosterone is the villain producing symptoms like leakiness of blood vessels, which causes edema.

**Andrew Murray:** To get onto calcium: when you have a low calcium diet, your blood calcium actually increases, and that calcium is damaging to soft tissues.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** David McCarron noticed that according to government figures, people who had the highest blood pressure ate the least salt. He saw that calcium was really the main thing affecting blood pressure. Parathyroid hormone comes down when you eat more calcium and have adequate Vitamin D. Parathyroid hormone increases aldosterone. If you restrict calcium, your parathyroid hormone goes up, making your aldosterone go up, which increases blood pressure and retains sodium.

**Andrew Murray:** So a calcium-deficient diet leads to hardened arteries and high blood pressure.

## Caller Questions

### Salt, Thyroid, and Atrial Fibrillation

**Caller 1:** I had an overactive thyroid and atrial fibrillation. My cardiologist thought I should cut out salt to help lose weight and lower blood pressure. I'm now on thyroid medication to balance things out. Is there any advantage to cutting back on salt for me?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hypothyroidism causes you to lose sodium and is probably the main cause of people having high aldosterone. Increased blood viscosity is a major thing causing rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation. Thyroid makes you able to regulate your minerals; it thins the blood and makes it easier for your heart to pump by lowering viscosity.

Investigating your thyroid function in more detail, you might not need the blood thinner because thyroid is the basic thing that keeps blood viscosity low. Hypothyroidism is an extremely common cause of hypertension. A calcium deficiency and low thyroid function make you actually sensitive to salt.

**Caller 1:** Now that I'm getting my thyroid balanced, can I have a normal amount of salt without worrying?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your calcium intake is well over 1,000 mg per day and your Vitamin D is good, then there's very little likelihood that you will be one of those salt-sensitive people.

### Estrogen and Phlebotomy

**Caller 2:** Dr. Peat has mentioned that menopausal women often get estrogen concentrated in their tissues. Progesterone can knock it out of tissues into the blood. Would it be advantageous to take progesterone and then get a phlebotomy (blood draw) to decrease systemic estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. If the liver is working, if you're eating enough protein, and if your thyroid is okay, your liver will send the estrogen straight to your kidneys to be excreted as soon as the progesterone gets it out of your cells. Progesterone destroys the estrogen receptor, destroys the enzyme that releases estrogen to deposit it in cells, and activates the enzymes that remove it. Everything progesterone does shifts the estrogen out of the cells so the liver can send it to the kidneys.

### Acidic Diet and Bone Loss

**Caller 3:** I was told that in this culture, our diets are so acidic that the body releases calcium from bones to alkalize the blood, causing osteoporosis. I was told that if you eat a balanced alkaline diet (vegetables), you don't need calcium supplements.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the problems with calcium supplements is that some, like calcium phosphate, have so much phosphate that it increases stress hormones and activates bone breakdown. The main things that take calcium out of the bones are cortisol, prolactin, and serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** Does an acidic diet have a direct effect on calcium mobilization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Phosphate is the main acidifying thing in the diet, and it mostly comes from beans, whole grains, seeds, nuts, and meat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That sounds like a vegetarian diet plus meat. The generalization is that the American diet is acidic because of meat, but dairy products like milk are neutral or slightly alkaline because of the high calcium. It's actually a calcium deficiency that causes calcium to leach out of the bones.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Raymond Peat's website is [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). There are lots of scholarly articles there, fully referenced. In a few days, it will be the solstice. The sun is right in the middle of the sky, so people's thyroids should be doing good from all the sunlight. Keep the polyunsaturated fats out of your diet and you'll go a long way to improving your health. Thanks for listening.
