## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Hi and welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in Herbal Medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts.

We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. He is an endocrinologist and researcher with many years of experience, here to illuminate some of the misinformation that's so prevalent in the medical literature. The topic this month is the misinformation concerning energy production, diabetes, and saturated fats. Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us again. For new listeners, could you give an overview of your background and education?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've studied a lot of different things, but my biological study was at the University of Oregon. I spent four years there working on a PhD. I started out thinking I was going to do nerve and brain biology, but the people in that section were so dogmatic. I looked around and found that the reproductive physiology and aging people were actually scientifically oriented. So, I shifted over and did my dissertation on the hormones, physiology, and energy metabolism of the aging reproductive system.

## The Myth of Essential Fatty Acids

**Andrew Murray:** I know you're very interested in maintaining good thyroid function. We have found that to be a key cornerstone to maintaining biological energy production, which is important in fighting the negative effects of environmental materials that lower our metabolic energy. One of the main stumbling blocks seems to be the misinformation regarding saturated fats versus polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think so. The people who created the idea of the "essential fatty acids" actually did an experiment a few years later with one of their lab people that showed why people should *not* eat the so-called essential fatty acids.

In 1929, when the Burrs published their claim that the polyunsaturated fats—linoleic acid and linolenic acid—were essential for life, other biologists had shown that animals were healthier when they had no fat in their diet. They had almost no cancer spontaneously developing. The Burrs simply ignored the evidence that the fats were harmful. Other biologists ignored the Burrs for about 20 years because the evidence was so overwhelmingly against their claims.

However, in their faith that those fats were essential, one of their lab people agreed to go on a fat-free diet for six months. His health remarkably improved. His blood lipids changed somewhat—cholesterol went down a little and triglycerides went up a little—but the total lipid quantity stayed about the same. Crucially, he didn't get tired after a day's work, as he always had, and his lifelong weekly migraine headaches disappeared forever.

**Andrew Murray:** So how did these oils become so popular?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nothing really assured the support of their position until the seed oil industry wanted to market their liquid seed oil—cottonseed oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, and so on. They brought the Burrs out of obscurity. They said, "Since they have proven that linoleic and linolenic acid are essential for life, we'll get the public to eat them in huge quantities and treat them as drugs rather than as trace nutrients."

They claimed these fats would make the skin healthier. But the counter-evidence showed that many animal diseases—degenerative brain disease, atrophy of the gonads, infertility—were connected with eating too much of the unsaturated fats. Vitamin E was found to protect against that damage.

It was a marketing campaign to sell the idea that not only are those fats essential, but they are good for you and will prevent heart disease. But very soon, people started producing evidence showing that linoleic acid not only causes heart disease but promotes cancer and immune problems.

**Andrew Murray:** These PUFAs are the fish oils, hemp seed oil, canola, etc.?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the 1950s, they were feeding a lot of fish to mink in farms, and they were producing what was called "yellow fat disease," which was related to the age pigment lipofuscin—a brown pigment that develops from the breakdown of the polyunsaturated fats. So, the fish oils, right along with the seed oils, were seen to be toxic in the 50s and 60s.

By the 1970s, linoleic acid was being recognized as a major cause of heart disease and cancer. Since they had sold the public on the idea of essential fatty acids, they just changed the story. They said, "Well, fish oils or linseed oil are a *different* kind of fat. They aren't the Omega-6 oils like the deadly linoleic acid; they're the Omega-3." But those had already been incriminated with yellow fat disease and lipofuscin.

**Andrew Murray:** So they just switched tactics to the Omega-3s.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and that's where we are now with the fish oil craze.

## Liver Health and Cholesterol

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What I find interesting is looking at our clients' blood work. A lot of clients have elevated liver enzymes, and when they start eating coconut oil, those enzymes come down.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A researcher on hepatitis and cirrhosis, Nanji, has shown for years that polyunsaturated fats injure the liver. I think it started with an Indian researcher noticing that in the butter regions of India, alcoholics didn't develop hepatitis or cirrhosis. He tested his observation on rats and found that if he fed them unsaturated oils, alcohol caused cirrhosis and hepatitis. If he fed them saturated fats, it didn't. Nanji tried that on his patients and found that their liver condition improved if he gave them a lot of sugar and saturated fat, and got worse if he fed them fish oils or seed oils.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't you say that when people take fish oils and they have high cholesterol, the cholesterol moves out of the blood and into the tissues as a stress response? So the blood test looks better, but it's just stored in the tissues?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Cholesterol is one of our most important protective antitoxins. For the unsaturated fats to lower the total production and the level in the blood is part of why they are something to avoid. The liver knows to retain any cholesterol it can because it is needed for cell division and function. All internal cellular processes rely on both cholesterol and saturated fatty acids.

If you overdose on polyunsaturated fats, all these intracellular mechanisms are deranged. The spindle that helps the cell divide and separates the chromosomes requires cholesterol and saturated fats to function. You get deranged expression of genes and deranged cell division if you have too much polyunsaturated fat.

## Identifying Good vs. Bad Fats

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Humans have been eating saturated fats for thousands of years. They didn't make seed oils or corn oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The safe oils are butter, chocolate fat (which is mostly stearic acid), coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef fat, lamb fat, and olive oil.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** People think of pork fat and chicken fat as bad fats, and they actually *are* bad fats because of what they feed the pigs and chickens. Unlike ruminant animals with multiple stomachs (beef, lamb), the chicken and pork fats are just as bad as the corn oil because the animals are eating corn.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They're now farming fish and feeding them some of the same foods they feed chickens and pigs. Interestingly, fish that live in cold oceans get their fats from plankton. The plankton fat is made by algae, which is where the Omega-3 fats come from. Basically, what we call fish fat is algae fat.

In experiments, they have given warm-blooded animals extra fish oil, or given fish a diet containing less unsaturated fat—like chicken fat or anchovy oil—and tested their endurance. The rats getting the fish oil had less endurance. Even the salmon on a pure fish oil diet had less endurance than when they were getting chicken fat or a less polyunsaturated fat. Fish oil isn't even so great for fish.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about farmed shrimp?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The good thing about anything growing in the ocean is that it has access to selenium, iodine, and other trace minerals. Things grown inland depend on whatever is in the soil, so they are often deficient in selenium and copper.

## Diabetes and Energy Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you explained that the problems with these oils hinge on the fact that we need an excess of metabolic energy to cope with insults from foods, drugs, or toxins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Diabetes is a good model of the energy-deprived state. Several years ago, someone suggested that Alzheimer's disease was "diabetes of the brain." People are seeing the effects of inflammation in all degenerative diseases. Inflammation involves a failure of energy and a shift to the diabetic metabolism, in which all you can do with glucose is mainly make lactic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** Which poisons you again, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Lactic acid is pro-inflammatory and doesn't produce enough energy for normal function. The essence of diabetes was pointed out by Randle in 1963 when he observed that if you increase the free fatty acids in the blood, you very quickly make the cells unable to use glucose.

**Andrew Murray:** It shifts their metabolism away from glucose directly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's now been worked out that there are two clear points where free fatty acids inhibit the use of glucose: Pyruvate dehydrogenase (which you need to burn glucose) and they stimulate glucagon. Glucagon turns on the synthesis of glucose at the expense of protein. Glucagon then stimulates the release of *more* fatty acids.

There are several points where free fatty acids activate adrenaline, ACTH, cortisol, TSH, and glucagon—all of which increase the release of free fatty acids from your fat storage. It seems illogical for the body to create those vicious circles where an energy failure turns on exactly what caused it. But it turns out that it's only the *polyunsaturated* fatty acids that have those terrible anti-energy effects.

If you compare stearic acid (butter/beef fat) and linoleic acid (corn oil), the butter turns off adrenaline and cortisol, while the corn oil turns them on. The excitotoxic system in the brain that kills brain cells is activated by polyunsaturated fats.

**Andrew Murray:** So these promote Alzheimer's and other degenerative diseases?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and they are calmed by stearic acid.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So these bad oils can cause diabetes by blocking your use of sugar, keeping blood sugar high, and also cause Alzheimer's.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look up the "saturation index," studies have found that people with cancer had much more polyunsaturated fat in the tumor and in their bodies than healthy people. Putting rodents on a high saturated fat diet delayed their development of breast cancer. Similarly, adding polyunsaturated fats shortened the lives of animals with a tendency toward heart disease, while a high saturated fat diet greatly extended their lives.

In recent years, people are seeing that the level of free fatty acids—which in our population means mostly unsaturated fats—has an extremely close connection to your likelihood of dying from just about anything: shock, aging, cancer, heart disease, and infection.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't this something good for a diabetic to test?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's been recognized for years that niacin is effective for not only heart disease but diabetes simply because it lowers the free fatty acids. But that isn't catching on because it's so cheap.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What are food sources of niacinamide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All animal foods have a reasonable amount: liver, milk, eggs. Coffee also has a lot of niacin.

## Caller: Gallbladder Issues and Fat Digestion

**Caller 1:** I have a friend who has difficulty digesting fats because of hereditary gallbladder difficulties. Are there any enzymes, supplements, or herbs that would help in the digestion of fats? He has difficulty eating red meats and pork, but not so much fish or poultry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a great tendency for hypothyroid people to have gallbladder disease and trouble digesting fats. The best thing to do for gallbladder disease is to improve thyroid function. Avoiding unsaturated fats in all forms is very important for thyroid function.

The myth tells us that the only difference between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids is their shape. But really, the absolute difference is the way they bind to proteins. Since the basic framework of the cell is protein, saturated fats bind properly, while unsaturated fats bind to proteins they shouldn't. The protein that transports thyroid hormone has sites that associate with the double bonds in the thyroid hormone molecule. Unsaturated fats bind to those same sites on the transport protein, so the protein carries unsaturated fats instead of thyroid hormone.

**Caller 1:** So this might be a cascading difficulty that originates in the thyroid and prevents the gallbladder from properly producing enzymes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Until he can get that sorted out, there are liver herbs that can help improve bile flow. Gentian, Burdock root, and Dandelion root are very bitter herbs that can stimulate the flow of bile. Swedish Bitters is a traditional European tonic that has those types of herbs.

## Mitochondrial Damage and Recovery

**Andrew Murray:** Let's get back to the energy balance. How do PUFAs impact the organism's ability to be metabolically active enough to pay off the debt of inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I mentioned the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, which feeds glucose into the oxidative system. But the mitochondrial oxidative system itself is basically destroyed in proportion to the polyunsaturated fat exposure. The mitochondria produces something like 35 times more energy per molecule of sugar than the diabetic pathway (lactic acid) can produce.

**Andrew Murray:** Because diabetics are forced into a fat-burning mode rather than glucose-burning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If it was purely saturated fat, that would be okay. When we are at rest, our cells can burn saturated fat. But with age, our tissues become more and more concentrated with polyunsaturated fats because the fat cells themselves preferentially burn the "good stuff" (saturated fat) for their own maintenance, leaving the PUFA to accumulate.

When we are under stress and don't get enough sugar, we have to burn the bad stuff. That does many things to the mitochondria, including destroying the genetic material inside them. Saturated fat doesn't do that; it is just quietly oxidized.

**Andrew Murray:** So this would give rise to cancers as a result of damaged DNA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The PUFAs break down into isoprostanes and neuroprostanes, which are inflammatory. Fragment molecules like hydroxy-nonenal attach to hemoglobin, genetic material, enzymes, and signaling molecules. Most of the things called "glycation" are really fat breakdown proteins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How long would it take if someone stopped eating all these bad oils and just started eating butter and coconut oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The complete changeover takes about four years. But if you eat frequently and thoroughly avoid stress-causing foods—don't let yourself get hungry enough to call on stress hormones to liberate fat—you can very quickly shift over to efficient metabolism. Frequent feeding, always with sugar and absolutely no PUFA, allows the slow disposition of the unsaturated toxic fats. The liver treats PUFA like other toxins; if it has the energy, it detoxifies them for excretion.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's why when women go on weight loss programs and lose 60 to 70 pounds quickly, their liver enzymes go up. They burn too many of these polyunsaturates at once.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you're under stress, you not only damage blood vessels and nerve cells, but you specifically knock out the enzymes needed to detoxify things.

## Caller: Blood Type Diet and Cravings

**Caller 2:** I've heard of the "Eat Right for Your Blood Type" diet. I'm O positive, and it says beef is good for me. I notice when I'm stressed or tired, I get a yearning for a hamburger or meat. What do you think about the relationship between blood types, food, and cravings?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies showing we have specific nerve systems that tell us what we're deficient in. We crave protein when we're deficient in protein. We crave sugar and salt very specifically if we need those. Hypothyroid people generally crave sugar and salty food. Vitamin C causes a craving for sour, tangy foods.

**Caller 2:** I notice stress brings out cravings. If I'm really stressed, I might want a donut, but I also find I crave beef. I try to buy the lowest fat content beef I can, but I'm hearing your cautionary information regarding animal fats. I'm trying to find a balance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Beef fat is not a dangerous fat. If the animal is grass-fed and organic, the fat should be clean. It's the chicken, pork, turkey, and fish fats that are dangerous because of what they are fed (corn/soy).

**Caller 2:** You mentioned earlier that with swine and chickens, it's the feed causing the issue. Is that the same with fish?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the fish have almost an absolute reflection of their diet in their fat. Fish in the Amazon contain fat that is as saturated as butter because of the water temperature.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The old story about Eskimos not getting heart disease because they eat fish is actually because they eat whale blubber, which is very saturated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One interesting point is that when cows eat bad food (corn/soy), because they have four stomachs, the bacteria can transfer that bad fat into a saturated fat. So beef fat is not dangerous like the fat of the chicken or pig. The cow's bacteria use Vitamin E to saturate the fat, basically detoxifying the unsaturated fats.

**Andrew Murray:** We lost you for a second. You said Vitamin E helps saturate the fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Even in humans, Vitamin E will cause some of that in the intestine if bacteria are present. Vitamin E lets the bacteria saturate and detoxify some of the PUFA.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if someone were to eat french fries, they could take Vitamin E to help prevent some damage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, or make the french fries in coconut oil.

## Conclusion: The Randall Cycle

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the caller who craved donuts under stress—do you understand that stress as a need for blood sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The most intense connection between need and appetite is between sugar and salt.

**Andrew Murray:** We've heard misinformation that sugar and salt are bad, but they are actually important anti-stress compounds. Could you briefly explain the Randall hypothesis again?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some call it the Randall Cycle, but it's just a competition. When you raise your free fatty acids, you inhibit the ability to oxidize glucose. Stress increases free fatty acids. Oxidizing glucose is what you need to overcome stress.

The body is designed to respond to saturated fat because saturated fats block the stress reaction. A properly functioning body under stress would provide saturated fats from storage, which would inhibit the stress hormones and allow the cycle to be broken.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we are just living in a time where we consume poisonous fats (PUFA) that our bodies aren't used to, and they don't respond the same way as saturated fats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If science had simply been looking to understand the situation since 1950, the systematic differences between saturated and unsaturated fats would have been clear. But advertising swamped the cultural situation.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. For listeners, Dr. Peat's website is www.raypeat.com, where you can find scholarly referenced articles on these topics.
