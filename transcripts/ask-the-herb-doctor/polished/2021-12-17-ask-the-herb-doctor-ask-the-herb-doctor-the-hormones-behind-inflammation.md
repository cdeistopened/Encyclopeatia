## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome back to Ask Your Herb Doctor. Every month we have a guest speaker, and that guest speaker is the faithful, ever-reliable, factual, and informative Dr. Raymond Peat. This month is no exception. Dr. Peat is joining us to discuss the continuing subject of cancer with reference to autoimmunity and estrogen. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. For those who perhaps haven't read anything you've written or heard you speak, would you explain your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I graduated from college, it was in the humanities. I was an English major for a while, then art, psychology, and philosophy. I specialized in linguistics and wanted to understand how language works in the brain. I decided to study biology to better understand the brain so I could understand language as a basis for understanding culture and humanities.

When I got to graduate school at the University of Oregon in 1968, I learned that the brain scientists were the most dogmatic. The geneticists were more dogmatic, but the brain science people were high status and very dogmatic. I looked around for people oriented towards science rather than dogmatism and found that reproductive physiology people were actually doing research and not throwing away evidence that contradicted their basic ideas.

I specialized in the physiology of oxidative metabolism as it changes in the reproductive system with aging. That happened to provide a good perspective on how to understand the brain and its energy. I wrote *Mind and Tissue*, a little book about the history of understanding brain metabolism in relation to psychology. Then, for 10 or 20 years, I specialized in the interactions of hormones and nutrition, counseling people on the effects of living and eating on the hormonal system and aging.

**Andrew Murray:** You said the reproductive physiology people were far less likely to throw away good information. Is this because the estrogen industry hadn't really gotten so much traction at this point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My brain nerve biology professor described doing some research in class and said, "And then you throw away the bad data." I would point out an instrument reading to him that was impossible by his ideas, and it just turned off his brain in a flash. I'm sure his memory was that he never saw that happen. I've often wondered how my thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, came to be so open to the facts and resistant to the industry position. I think it was partly that he was born and educated before the power of the industry took over. He was aware of the research done in the 1930s that absolutely contradicted everything the estrogen industry has foisted onto the public since 1944.

## Estrogen, Genetics, and Autoimmunity

**Andrew Murray:** Getting to the subject of tonight: estrogen, autoimmunity, and cancer. I want to read a paragraph from a 2021 paper regarding why women are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. It states:

> "New data suggests that the hormone estrogen may play an important role. A new study now shows that estrogen activates the expression of AID (activation-induced deaminase), which is a protein that drives antibody diversification by deaminating cytosine in DNA to uracil. If estrogen increases the level of AID, increased mutations could transform benign antibodies into self-anti-self pariahs. AID might also contribute to cancer, particularly in breast tissue which is highly responsive to estrogen, by introducing mutations and strand breaks into the genome."

It seems researchers are finally disclosing how estrogen unfavorably influences the immune system to become a self-destructive mechanism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That article is an extremely important landmark. One of the very earliest estrogen-cancer researchers, Leonell Strong, showed that estrogen destabilizes the whole genome and promotes a tendency to develop an uneven number of chromosomes. It is a genetic destabilizer. That article focuses on one single enzyme which, when it functions, helps to produce the essentially infinite variety of antibodies by creating an extreme rate of mutation locally. But that same destabilizing process works on many levels, all the way to the shape and function of the basic cell.

In between the big landmarks, like that article on the AID mutagenic enzyme, you have an almost continuous, seamless bunch of other changes that estrogen is acting on. Increasing the water content of the cell, for example, helps to destabilize the whole system, hardening collagen, lowering oxygen tension, increasing nitric oxide production, and histamine production. It would take an hour just to identify the main pro-inflammatory mechanisms that have been identified. It is a holistic, almost seamlessly interacting process where one factor supports another.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you see estrogen driving autoimmunity specifically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pro-inflammatory part of inflammation and immunity that is activated by estrogen—such as histamine, nitric oxide, and serotonin—is an essential part of getting things started. But the next step is to turn off the excitatory process and focus on maturing the cells. Estrogen, by releasing histamine, activates many other pro-inflammatory things. It activates cell division and increases the production of antibodies. The B cells are activated by estrogen.

Meanwhile, the thymus gland shrinks very quickly in the presence of either estrogen or glucocorticoids. If you knock out the thymus T cells that restrain antibody production, things like this enzyme you just cited (AID) become more and more dominant. The B cells, being activated by estrogen and lacking restraint from the T cells, create a varied, random, irrational activity of antibodies. In that relatively random activity, some of the antibodies cause damage rather than contributing to cleaning up the infection process.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If estrogen is an important stimulator of inflammation for healing purposes, at what point does it go wrong?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is exactly the same thing that happens in pregnancy. Estrogen and histamine create a little focus of activity and inflammation in the uterus that the conceptus takes advantage of to implant. But if that process of local inflammation kept dominating, it would interfere with the oxygen and glucose supply to the fetus. You have to stop the excitation and inflammation to really start delivering glucose and oxygen.

One of the natural functions of estrogen is to evoke the progesterone receptor, making the cells open to being turned off by progesterone. Estrogen should excite and inflame the tissue, but immediately turn the tissue towards looking for relief from progesterone. Progesterone knocks out the estrogen in roughly 10 different ways—turning off the production of estrogen, knocking out the estrogen receptor, and changing the metabolism. That is what happens every time you have a little injury that evokes the estrogen-activated start of the healing process; it should increase the cell's ability to receive and be matured by progesterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** For women that have autoimmune conditions, would you recommend progesterone to help combat the inflammatory effects of estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. People are now recognizing the role of progesterone along with DHEA and thyroid. Over the last 50 years, I've seen several women with seriously debilitating effects of Lupus (SLE) simply take thyroid and progesterone, and all of their symptoms faded away over several weeks.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the thyroid is combating the estrogen, helping improve the liver's ability to excrete it, and increasing oxygen to the cell.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And making more progesterone.

## Plastics and Environmental Estrogens

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What role do plastics in our environment play in stimulating estrogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Birth control pills getting into the sewage end up in the rivers and recycle. Just the tremendous flow of estrogen down the sewers is a tremendous polluting source. But regarding plastics, the agents used to make stiff plastics more flexible are effective estrogens in very small amounts. All of the water supply of the world is contaminated with those.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to ask about the link between viruses and cancer. I saw recent research relating Epstein-Barr virus to autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto's, Graves', and Lupus. Do you go along with the theory of viral interference promoting destabilization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The same inflammation that leads to the direct actions of estrogen on the T and B cells—and on their ability to make the safe type of antibodies—affects all of the cells of your body, shifting them a little bit to the unstable tendency to lack enough oxygen and take up more water than is desirable.

## Caller: Corporate Collusion & DES

**Caller (Joe):** Is there a correlation between the plastics makers and the pharmaceutical industry? It is a known fact that the Roundup company also holds patents to the medicine that treats the symptoms caused by their products.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are the most powerful industries next to the military arms industry. They have had control of the government regulatory agencies for well over 100 years. The asbestos industry was less powerful compared to pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals, yet it took about 100 years to reduce the public's exposure to carcinogenic levels of asbestos. The government is working against the public on matters of pollution.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Haven't you told us that estrogen is manufactured from petrochemical products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The original ones were Diethylstilbestrol (DES). It was so cheap; it was a perfect drug. It cost nothing to manufacture but had very powerful estrogen-like effects. They continued using it to treat prostate cancer right into the very end of the 20th century.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's what you believe causes prostate cancer, right? The estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That treatment was based on zero evidence. It was a total matter of opinion, contrary to all of the research in animals. But it affected many millions of men for about 55 years.

## Dietary Supplements: DIM & Bitter Melon

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about Diindolylmethane (DIM) for anti-estrogenic purposes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were studies in fish in which it had a pro-estrogenic effect, so I've been a little skeptical of it. But to the extent that you can show in humans that it is protective, then it's a pretty safe material. Just eat your cabbage and broccoli.

**Andrew Murray:** I also saw a study on *Momordica charantia* (Bitter Melon), a climbing cucurbit. They are saying it has strong estrogen modulating properties and significant antagonism of estradiol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** [Acknowledged].

## Endotoxin, PUFA, and Leaky Gut

**Andrew Murray:** Are there other substances that affect estrogen and decrease its ability to wreak havoc on the chromosomes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two factors that powerfully go with the inflammation and destabilizing effect of estrogen, adding to the tendency to develop autoimmunity. One is **endotoxin**. If you're overloaded with estrogen, your blood vessels tend to be leaky. That increases the risk of exposure to endotoxin, which intensifies that leakiness and affects all of your cells.

The other main factor is **polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)** and the prostaglandins they are converted to. Free polyunsaturated fatty acids have a direct effect, activating estrogen—for example, knocking out the estrogen-binding protein so that the estrogen is freed to be more active. Under the influence of estrogen, the excitatory prostaglandins are activated. In a healthy situation, prostaglandins are blocked by progesterone. Once you shift over to the estrogen influence, you're at increased risk from the polyunsaturated fats and the endotoxin coming from your intestine.

**Andrew Murray:** I'm glad you mentioned endotoxin and leaky gut. I saw an article associating leaky gut with being the initial insult that allowed fragments like gliadin from gluten to pass into the bloodstream. They said the gliadin molecule was very similar to T3 and T4 structure, causing autoimmune thyroiditis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For a long time, celiac disease has been increasing right along with the exposure to estrogen. It has gone from mostly a childhood disease to mostly in adult women. There are several things that overlap antigenically with the tissues under the influence of estrogen and gluten.

## Caller: Carcinogenic Foods

**Caller:** What are three categories of foods one can avoid that are highly carcinogenic? How does that compare to smoking cigarettes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
1.  **Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA):** Any vegetable seed oil.
2.  **Pro-inflammatory amino acids:** Tryptophan, Methionine, and Cysteine. These are found in high-quality proteins in excess. You don't want to eat a pound and a half of meat per day.
3.  **Excess Iron:** Anything that contains a very great excess of iron.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Olive oil is 90% monounsaturated, so that is okay, but other seed oils are polyunsaturated.

**Andrew Murray:** How does a diet rich in PUFAs compare in cancer risk to smoking a pack a day of cigarettes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** PUFA is probably the biggest carcinogenic part of the American diet.

## Caller: Grains and Meat Quality

**Caller:** Does whole wheat flour fall under carcinogenic foods? And is chicken healthy to eat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason flour and grains were polished—like white rice and white flour—is that the whole grains get rancid and toxic fairly quickly in storage. If you're going to eat whole wheat flour soon after it's ground, it's probably not so bad. But once it gets in your blood, those excess polyunsaturated fats start to react with iron to produce lipid peroxides and free radical toxins. Polished rice has very little nutritional value, but has fewer storage toxins.

Regarding chicken: On a typical industrial diet, chicken is full of very unstable polyunsaturated fats. In excess, I think it is pretty carcinogenic.

**Andrew Murray:** But if you had access to good, fresh, locally raised chicken from a free diet, is 4 ounces a day okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think so. It's the same with pork. Industrial pork has over 30% PUFA in the fat. If people are careful what they feed their pigs—like the traditional diet of whey and old vegetables—the fat goes down almost like beef, to around 4% PUFA.

## Gluten and Transglutaminase

**Andrew Murray:** Before we lose the thread on gluten and estrogen...

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The enzyme **transglutaminase** is in common between gluten and the lining of the intestine acted upon by estrogen. If we have antibodies to the foreign protein gluten, they will act against our own tissues as far as they're under the influence of estrogen, which induces transglutaminase. The transglutaminase aspect of estrogen is the cross-linking enzyme that hardens collagen. Under the influence of estrogen producing transglutaminase, collagen itself becomes hardened and carcinogenic rather than flexible.

## Caller: Seeds and Rancidity

**Caller:** What is your opinion on eating hemp seed and pumpkin seed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are not necessarily the worst for the PUFA content, but I wouldn't say it's something you should do regularly because of the breakdown products. They're probably fairly rancid by the time you ingest them anyway.

## Caller: Construction Materials & Detox

**Caller (Corey):** I'm a construction worker and work with laminated glues, ABS glue, and PVC. I assume these exude bio-estrogens. I would love to know about the risks of these materials.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the safety law system is really part of a superstructure that enforces the use of dangerous materials. The basic system is designed to direct production towards these cheapest and most dangerous chemicals. In the long run, I think the problem would be solved very economically by using materials like mud and cement. They pollute very little and are chemically inert once in place.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What are some dietary strategies if you've been working all day with these chemicals? How do you get that stuff out of your body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
1.  **Fiber:** Any good fiber that isn't too poisonous. Raw carrot (moderately shredded) allows us to absorb very little of the irritating chemicals while absorbing estrogen from the bowel. Other fibers include well-cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots, or even well-cooked oat bran. This keeps the intestine from recycling poisons to the liver.
2.  **Metabolic Rate:** Watch that your thyroid isn't suppressed. Keeping your metabolic rate up and temperature around 98.6°F during the peak of the day will promote quick peristalsis.
3.  **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Calcium, especially from low-fat milk, supported by Vitamin D. Both are good for weight loss and keeping the metabolic rate higher.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And lastly, progesterone is a direct combat molecule to estrogen.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat. For those listening, you can find more information at RayPeat.com and our website westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

I want to finish with a thought on authoritarianism. We are evolving as a species, but nature is not accepting; it selects the fittest. Rules exist—like time, gravity, and death. Authoritarianism is at odds with our founding principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. With increasing authoritarianism and legislation aimed at making us accept everything without boundaries, I leave you with this: resist and live. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thanks for tuning in tonight. Good night.
