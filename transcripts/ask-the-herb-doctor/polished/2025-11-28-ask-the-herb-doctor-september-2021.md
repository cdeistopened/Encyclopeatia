## Introduction

**Michael McCaskill:** The Herb Doctors aren't here yet, so this is your engineer, Michael McCaskill. We are having a special show tonight where we're just going to be having an open call-in session to ask Dr. Peat your questions. Dr. Peat, could you give a tiny bit of background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been doing nutrition consulting largely for the last 40 or 50 years, but I'm recently getting more interested in immunology. It's been 40 years since I taught a course in immunology, but because of the pandemic, I started reading more about it. I’ve been looking at the history and the development of corporate and government science, and the way those influences have distorted the understanding of immunology even in these 40 years since I was studying and teaching it.

## Vitamin D and Immunity

**Michael McCaskill:** Could you give some herbological or dietary things which you think would be beneficial for everybody to do, regardless of whether they're vaccinated or not, to make sure that whatever tactics they're using work the very best for them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D is probably the single most important thing for Americans. Considering the average American diet, the majority of people are far below the optimal level of vitamin D. Even though the establishment still believes that the lower end of the normal range is adequate, when you look at degenerative diseases—heart disease and even some fairly rare things like scleroderma—the whole range of degenerative system failure is associated with a fairly low vitamin D level.

Something that has kept more doctors from prescribing vitamin D is that there have periodically been scares about the dangers of taking too much. It's true that if you take a million units or so, after a while you'll start getting hypercalcemia—calcification of soft tissues. But the most common cause of calcification of the soft tissues is actually from a *deficiency* of vitamin D.

With aging and failure of the kidneys, calcification of the kidney tissue and blood vessels becomes the lethal problem. The mechanism is that kidney failure is associated with extreme vitamin D deficiency and an excess of parathyroid hormone. They've seen that removing the parathyroid glands can alleviate some of the symptoms of calcification from kidney failure. Just supplementing a moderate amount of vitamin D, like 5,000 units a day for an adult, can be enough. If you have calcium in your diet, it can be enough to lower the parathyroid hormone. Lowering the parathyroid hormone makes you put your calcium into the bones where it should go, keeping it out of the soft tissues.

**Michael McCaskill:** Are there other things that you get from sunlight in addition to vitamin D that might make that a better source than just taking a pill?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The ultraviolet light acts on the skin cells themselves, but the visible light—especially the orange and red light—penetrates very deeply. If you hold your hand up and look at the sunlight shining through it, it's very red on the shaded side, showing that the red light easily penetrates the thickness of your skin. The red light is an anti-free radical protection. It effectively quenches excited electrons and reverses the free radical damage done by ultraviolet light. So a tanning bed, which is only infrared and UV, will produce more aging effects than sunlight. The quenching effect of the red and orange light in sunlight detoxifies much of the free radical damage done by the ultraviolet.

**Michael McCaskill:** Perhaps all tanning beds should include red LEDs as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

## Cellular Excitation and Infection Susceptibility

**Caller:** In one of your first newsletters about this coronavirus, you said cellular excitation is required for a coronavirus infection. If a person is not cellularly excited, would they just not be exposed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your cells are already in a weakened, excitable state, they are the most susceptible to viral infection. If the cell is stable, even if it's infected by a virus, it will turn off the process rather than letting the virus propagate. The things that are known to be protective against the infection or development of the disease include almost all of the known safe anti-inflammatory substances. Aspirin, naproxen, and progesterone are known to protect against the infection and alleviate its worst symptoms. Vitamin D has that calming, quieting effect on cells. The antihistamines, anti-serotonin drugs, and anti-angiotensin blood pressure treatments such as Losartan and Candesartan are also protective.

**Caller:** You talked about how some proteins are acidifying—like phosphorus gets metabolized into phosphoric acid. You talked about the importance of having adequate alkaline minerals in your cells so the body wouldn't have to sacrifice itself.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens in the kidneys; the kidneys will break down protein to balance the pH. But the phosphate itself has an excitatory action. When ATP is breaking down in doing the cell work, it liberates inorganic phosphate. Inorganic phosphate has an excitatory effect. When it can get attached back to form ATP again, the cell relaxes. So ATP's effect is relaxing, making it stable against infection. An excess of free phosphate antagonizes the stabilizing effect of vitamin D and calcium and puts cells into the excited state, making them susceptible to infections.

**Caller:** How do sulfur and sulfuric acid play into that imbalance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are pretty safe. If you add too much sulfur to your diet, you'll disturb the absorption of minerals. For example, you can block the formation of pigment by cutting down your assimilation of copper if you have too much sulfur. But otherwise, sulfur-rich foods are reasonably safe; you can dispose of it as the acid.

## Diuretics, CO2, and Oxygen Therapy

**Caller:** My friend's husband had the virus and had a bad experience. He's back in the hospital and they have him on diuretics. What helps someone who has a long-Covid autoimmune condition hitting their kidneys?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mentioning the diuretics brings up a perspective on what's actually happening in the infection. In the first weeks of the pandemic, two doctors in New York realized that the symptoms of COVID were essentially the same as the symptoms of high-altitude sickness. People who don't adapt to very high altitude develop edema of the lungs and general inflammatory systems—a failure of the tissues to use oxygen properly.

One of the established treatments for mountain sickness is a diuretic called acetazolamide, which restores the level of carbon dioxide in your body and the acidity. The acidity is a quieting, sedating effect that also causes the tissue cells to give up excess water. Carbon dioxide itself has many calming, quieting, sedative effects.

One of these doctors, Cameron Kyle-Sidell, observed that the inflamed lung thickness between the capillary and the air chamber is increased by inflammation. A deficiency of carbon dioxide contributes to the thickening, making it harder for gases to diffuse. It happens that carbon dioxide diffuses much faster through liquid than oxygen does. Kyle-Sidell observed the breathing problem is because you're losing carbon dioxide very fast. When your carbon dioxide level goes down, oxygen sticks too firmly to the hemoglobin. It increases the blood's affinity for oxygen to the point that your tissue cells are starving for oxygen despite oxygen being there. It helps to some extent to get more oxygen in, but it's really the deficiency of carbon dioxide in the blood that keeps the oxygen from being delivered as needed.

**Michael McCaskill:** I've heard complaints about masks increasing the carbon dioxide level that people are breathing in. Might that actually be a bonus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's what the acetazolamide and calcium channel blockers are doing. It's making you retain the carbon dioxide more efficiently.

**Michael McCaskill:** Would drinking carbonated drinks help increase your carbon dioxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even adding baking soda to water helps. Marathon runners and bicyclists have found that if they put a tablespoon of baking soda in a glass of water, their endurance is greatly increased, apparently by the provision of that bonus of carbon dioxide.

The hospitals that used the forced ventilating machines—putting a tube into the throat and pumping oxygen—were having terribly high mortality, some approaching 100%. Adjoining hospitals simply passively giving them a little extra oxygen had close to zero mortality. The excess of oxygen was entering the lungs and increasing the problem of diffusing gases by driving out too much carbon dioxide.

That brings up the subject of Carbogen. It had been a treatment from the 1930s up until the mid-1950s. Hospitals recognized that using typically a 5% carbon dioxide / 95% oxygen mixture, rather than pure oxygen, prevented the damage to the lungs. Nothing happened scientifically to explain why it shouldn't be used, but a government medical committee in England declared that asphyxia is synonymous with having too much carbon dioxide. They were simply talking through their hats. But since that official statement, its use dropped off.

**Caller:** I found a translation of a paper in German from 1904 that said sometimes a person doesn't need oxygen, just give them a little whiff of carbon dioxide and it improves their oxygen uptake.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the way it works. The more acidic carbon dioxide molecule shifts the pH and oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin. It out-competes the oxygen for combining with the hemoglobin.

Carbon dioxide binds to the hemoglobin forming a chemical bond called the carbamino group. The textbooks mention that the amino group of certain amino acids chemically combines with carbon dioxide, forming a chemically modified protein. It happens that all of our body proteins display some of these same amino groups, so carbon dioxide is going to similarly bind every place in the body that there is protein. Carbon dioxide modifies those proteins. So the toxicity of losing your proper level of carbon dioxide—by going to high altitude, hyperventilating, or being ventilated with pure oxygen—is not only inflaming your lungs, but effectively inflaming every protein in your body.

## Carnitine vs. Glucose Oxidation

**Caller:** What do you think of a substance called L-Carnitine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's active in helping you oxidize fats. In ordinary metabolism, it's essential. But when you're under stress, the products of oxidizing pure fat will produce less carbon dioxide in proportion to the oxygen used. In stressful situations, such as a failing heart, carnitine—by increasing your ability to oxidize fats—can actually increase the problem of oxygen availability.

In the 1990s, people found that if you could keep the cells oxidizing glucose, they produce more carbon dioxide per oxygen consumed. The effect is to make metabolism more efficient, reduce inflammation via increased carbon dioxide, and leave more oxygen available. The chemical that increased the ability to use glucose rather than fat was called Mildronate at first, and more recently they are calling it Meldonium. Athletes are using it, and I think it has disqualified some famous athletes because it improves their endurance noticeably. It works by bypassing carnitine.

## Dairy: Whey and Casein

**Caller:** I seem to crave cottage cheese and I think it might be the whey that I crave. Could you discuss whey and what it does?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both the whey and the casein fractions have multiple beneficial effects that are approaching hormonal and immune-promoting. One of their virtues is that they are deficient in iron but have almost all of the other nutrients associated with them. Iron happens to be one of the main risks of any stress; stress tends to make iron toxic and increase your susceptibility to infections. Milk provides all the helpful nutrients but is very deficient in iron.

Also, the high calcium content of milk products works along with vitamin D to suppress parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone is one of our basic pro-inflammatory problems. It lowers our cellular energy production but also increases many of our basic inflammation-producing processes.

## Arrhythmia and Histamine

**Caller:** Is there any nutritional advice for people with arrhythmia, specifically PVCs (premature ventricle contractions)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the basic medical recommendations is to avoid hyperthyroidism. But in reality, a *chronic lack* of thyroid hormone can create preconditions for having arrhythmia. This includes nutritional imbalances and increases of stress hormones, and an imbalance between the stress steroids (including cortisol and estrogen) and the anti-stress, quieting steroids (pregnenolone, progesterone, and to some extent the androgens).

**Caller:** Is there any association with histamine and arrhythmia? I also have very itchy skin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, serotonin and histamine are closely connected with changing the heart rhythm. Milk products have an antihistamine, anti-inflammatory effect. A good balance of all the essential nutrients is needed for balancing your thyroid function. Seafood at least once a week is helpful for the trace minerals.

## Cravings and Nutritional Wisdom

**Michael McCaskill:** How do cravings work? How might the body know what is good for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies, mostly in animals, but some people have tested it on their kids. They notice kids will sometimes seem to have a completely crazy, deranged appetite, wanting only one food for several meals in a row. But when they added them up over a period of a week or two, it turned out that their choices resulted in a proper balance of nutrients.

They've tested that on animals by creating a deficiency in a particular vitamin or amino acid. They find that the animal knows how to ignore a food that might seem generally good but is deficient in the nutrient they need, and concentrate on one food that's richest in what they need. It turns out there are only two or three essential amino acids that are taken as signals. But in nature, rare patterns of deficiency don't occur, so the signal of adequacy is always detectable. Animals, given a choice of natural foods, will essentially invariably pick out the ones that are nutritionally balanced.

## Lung Fungus and Immunity

**Caller:** I had a pile of wood chips delivered that was full of Aspergillus fungus. I inhaled the spores and was wheezing. Do you have advice about getting fungus out of my lungs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably your lungs are going to take care of it, but it never hurts to make sure your vitamin D is adequate. Vitamin D for Americans is the most important immune-supporting nutrient. But in the world in general, vitamin A and zinc are rivals for protection of the membranes and direct immunity to germs, mechanical, or chemical irritants. A good diet with anti-inflammatory foods besides milk products is helpful. Citrus fruits are very rich in flavonoids which are anti-inflammatory and pro-immunity. Coffee is another good source of anti-inflammatory substances such as quercetin.

## Vitamin D2 vs. D3

**Caller:** What is the difference between vitamin D and D3? Which one should we be taking?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D3 is the normal one that we make when we're in the sunlight. It works the same chemically as the one we make in the sunlight. Some of the products on the market are vitamin D2; that is metabolized slightly differently and doesn't have all of the good protective effects of vitamin D3.

In a medical context, you might hear people talk about calcitriol. You don't want the "triol"—some people confuse that with vitamin D3. It's cholecalciferol (D3) that is the usual supplement.

## Brain Fog

**Caller:** I feel like I have a brain fog issue. I suspect I had Covid a year ago. Do you have recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Brain fog goes with low energy production and low carbon dioxide. Vitamin B1 is a natural equivalent to acetazolamide and the calcium channel blockers in being an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, helping to raise your carbon dioxide. It's often the quickest way to clear up brain fog and get your mental energy back. But all of the anti-inflammatory things help: thyroid hormone, vitamin D, calcium, progesterone, and fruit juice.

## Diabetes and Intermittent Fasting

**Caller:** I've had diabetes for many years. I have investigated intermittent fasting and it seems to be bringing my blood sugar down. What are your thoughts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It will make your blood sugar go down, but anything that you can call fasting is going to be putting you under stress. The long-range thing that corrects chronic diabetes is to get your polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) lower—to completely eliminate them from your diet as far as possible. Use butter for cooking rather than any of the liquid vegetable oils.

The polyunsaturated fats are specifically toxic to your insulin-producing tissues. They create resistance in your tissues and damage the ability to oxidize sugar. There is no essential need for them; there's no benefit that will be lost by eating a completely saturated fat component in your diet.

It happens that glucose is constantly activating stem cells in your pancreas to restore the ability to produce insulin. It's the polyunsaturated fats stored in your tissues, or coming directly from your food, that will keep destroying or damaging your insulin-producing cells.
