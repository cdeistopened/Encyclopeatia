## Introduction: Saturated Fats and Heart Health

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to the show. I am Andrew Murray, a licensed medical herbalist. My co-host, Sarah Johanneson Murray, is currently at home with our new baby. Tonight, we are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat to discuss the heart and his recent article, "The Cancer Matrix."

Before we bring Dr. Peat on, I want to share some recent articles from Medscape that validate what Dr. Peat has been professing for the last 35 to 40 years: that saturated fats—animal fats, butter, etc.—are the good fats, and polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)—safflower, linoleic acid, seed oils, and fish oil—are the bad oils.

A recent British Medical Journal article titled "Use of dietary linoleic acid for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and death" analyzed recovered data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study. It found that substituting dietary linoleic acid (a PUFA) in place of saturated fats increased the rates of death from all causes, including coronary heart disease. For the past half-century, guidelines suggested replacing saturated fats with PUFAs to lower cholesterol, but clinical trials are finally showing that saturated fats are actually better for you.

Another review by Steve Stiles on Medscape, "Dietary Saturated Fat Has Undeserved Bad Reputation," highlights how processed meats and high-heat cooking methods, rather than the red meat itself, may be the problem. It also notes that the substances produced from PUFAs and carbohydrates during cooking are likely promoting disease.

Finally, a study on a food supplement called Pomi-T—containing broccoli, green tea, pomegranate, and turmeric—showed it significantly lowered prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in cancer patients. This aligns with Dr. Peat’s view of using food as medicine.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us. After 30 years of telling everyone that saturated fats are good for you and facing skepticism, how do you feel about these findings finally coming out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I am not sure what the motivation is exactly, because the information has been sitting around for 50 or 60 years. I guess someone has slipped on their public relations for the fish oil and PUFA industries, letting this stuff leak through into the media.

**Andrew Murray:** It is a big industry. Could you briefly introduce your professional background for our listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and 60s, I taught mostly in the humanities. Between 1968 and 1972, I returned to graduate school intending to study brain biology. I found the nerve and brain department to be highly dogmatic regarding molecular biology and genetics, so I shifted to the physiological chemistry of aging and the reproductive system for my thesis.

## The Propaganda of Fats

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding heart health, the common medical misconception is that saturated fats cause blocked arteries. This doesn't seem founded in research, yet it is the common theme in media.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You see a lot of material in medical literature spreading the propaganda line. Superficially, it presents itself as science. However, when you read it closely, it is often a professional trick where they compare the thing they want to sell against something they know to be extremely toxic. Since it is common knowledge that the other substance is powerfully toxic, anything compared against it will look beneficial.

Some of the bad research is just carelessness. For example, for about 30 or 40 years, researchers referred to lard as a "saturated fat." They would compare it to a vegetable oil and show an advantage to the vegetable oil. However, during this period, pigs were being fed corn and soybeans to fatten them up. Because of the high unsaturation of that feed, the lard became an extremely highly unsaturated fat. Yet, hundreds of research papers used it as the proxy for saturated fat.

## Cholesterol: A Protective Molecule

**Andrew Murray:** What do you see as the harmful effect of lowering cholesterol relevant to heart failure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far back as the 1920s, cholesterol was identified as a major protective, defensive molecule. In one experiment around 1920, they injected animals with various toxins—heavy metals, snake venom, infectious bacteria—and then gave them a cholesterol injection. They found it antidoted all those harmful things. This has been repeated roughly every 20 years. In any system you look at, increasing cholesterol improves functioning. For example, injecting it into animals being trained improves their memory and learning ability. It is a component of every part of a cell's anatomy, not just the membrane.

**Andrew Murray:** So a higher cholesterol is safer than a low cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I have known several doctors who deliberately kept their cholesterol down around 100 or 120 mg/dL, and I don't think any of them lived much beyond 40 years. One of the Framingham studies found that in people over the age of 50, those who had cholesterol levels higher than 200 were less likely to have dementia, showing a protective effect for the brain.

**Andrew Murray:** The cutoff point on most blood tests is 200 mg/dL, at which point they prescribe statins. But you are saying that for people over 50, lowering it artificially with statins is damaging.

## Thyroid Function and Muscle Energy

**Andrew Murray:** You are a big proponent of thyroid as an energy molecule. Do you see muscle weakness as part of a low thyroid picture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is a very close connection between polyunsaturated fats and thyroid function; they are inversely related. PUFAs suppress thyroid function at every level—formation, secretion, transport, and cellular action.

Low thyroid allows muscles to fatigue easily because energy isn't being produced by respiration at the necessary level. When a muscle is fatigued, it activates processes to provide more energy, which liberates fats from storage as free fatty acids. These free fatty acids further suppress the thyroid and start an inflammatory process. The muscle shifts from simply being fatigued to becoming inflamed and breaking down. This muscle breakdown can sometimes kill a person; it is one of the side effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins).

## Exercise and Heart Rate

**Andrew Murray:** There are misconceptions surrounding endurance training and aerobic exercise. You have mentioned that this can be damaging.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In one experiment where people walked on a treadmill to keep the heart rate up to 120 or less, they found that the liver's production of the active thyroid hormone decreased radically in less than an hour. If a person is very healthy, the thyroid will bounce back. But if their tissues are loaded with thyroid-suppressive fats, that exercise liberates the fats and prevents the thyroid from recovering quickly.

**Andrew Murray:** You prefer a person's resting heart rate to be between 80 and 100, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. An experiment looking at high school students found that those with the highest grades averaged 85 beats per minute at rest, while lower-performance students averaged around 70.

**Andrew Murray:** What about marathon runners who have a pulse of 50 and claim to be incredibly fit?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In general, that very slow heart rate correlates with a slow metabolism in everything. Sperm production, for example, is usually very low in endurance runners. Some drug companies do trick research to make it look like a lower heart rate is better by including people with heart failure in the study. When the heart is failing, it beats weakly and therefore must beat more often. If you include those people, it makes it look like those with a fast heart rate are about to die.

## Heart Regeneration and Fibrosis

**Andrew Murray:** I was taught that heart muscle cells were finite, but new research shows stem cells can create new heart cells. How does thyroid hormone promote this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As long as heart cells are able to respire using sugar (glucose) and producing carbon dioxide, any damaged muscle cell will be replaced by a recruited stem cell. In the presence of thyroid and plentiful glucose, that stem cell will mature into a muscle cell.

However, if the cell is blocked by free fatty acids which interfere with glucose use, the heart cells produce lactic acid. Lactic acid is a signal to produce collagen. The arriving stem cells receive that signal and turn into fibroblasts, producing connective tissue. The heart becomes progressively fibrotic.

We see two kinds of heart enlargement. One is where the heart works harder—like with thyroid supplementation—and becomes a good, muscular, functioning heart. The other is a stressed, plugged-up heart that enlarges by producing collagen and becoming fibrotic. Experiments show that giving T3 (active thyroid hormone) to animals with fibrotic hearts causes the fibrosis to regress and be replaced by functional tissue.

**Andrew Murray:** So T3 is anti-fibrotic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in the liver and every place it has been studied. It helps reverse fibrosis by keeping the environment low in lactic acid and high in carbon dioxide, allowing differentiation to go in the right direction.

## Caller: Short Bowel Syndrome and Dehydration

**Caller (Piercy):** I am 66 years old. I have had four major surgeries and have only eight feet of small intestine left with a double ostomy. My peristaltic action is so fast that I dehydrate constantly. I was taking Donnatal, but it is not available. My doctor has me on hydromorphone to slow the bowel, but is there anything herbal or otherwise to slow peristalsis so I don't have to use IV fluids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you tried antihistamines such as cyproheptadine? It is both anti-serotonin and anti-histamine.

**Caller (Piercy):** No, I haven't.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have slight belladonna or atropine-like side effects which can slow the gut.

**Andrew Murray:** From an herbal perspective, astringents would be indicated. These are rich in tannins—the things in tea that dry your mouth. There are many classifications of astringents that could be used internally to help with loose, watery stools.

**Caller (Piercy):** Thank you. By the way, my mother knew that mono- and polyunsaturated oils were the basis for lacquers and paints before crude oil became cheaper. She taught me to only use butter, olive oil, or coconut oil. I tell people here to quit eating organic polyunsaturated oils because rattlesnake venom is organic too, but that doesn't make it good for you.

## Caller: HDL vs. LDL Cholesterol

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** What do you think of the ratio between HDL and LDL cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both of them are anti-inflammatory. The protein which carries the cholesterol has a major biological effect defending against irritants. However, studies show a correlation between very high HDL and inflammatory diseases like cancer, because HDL rises defensively against chemical irritants. For example, drinking too much alcohol or exposure to fish oil peroxidation will raise your HDL defensively.

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** So you are saying HDL is the bad cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it is defensive. But having it high doesn't necessarily mean you are on a good diet program.

**Caller (Southern Humboldt):** What is a good ratio?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't that simple, but a ratio of two or three LDL to one HDL is usually reasonable.

## Caller: Swollen Lymph Nodes and Scans

**Caller (Blocksburg):** I have a knot in the lymph gland near my jaw. It has been there for four years, but recently developed a little extra growth and swelling. They want me to have a CAT scan. Is that dangerous?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely, CAT scans are not safe. That amount of radiation is known to have a permanently inflammatory action. Swollen lymph glands can often mean you are exposed to allergens or foods you are sensitive to.

**Caller (Blocksburg):** It feels like it has some hard tissues. They put me on antibiotics and the swelling went down, but when I stopped, it swelled back up.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it is hardened, that suggests it might be becoming cancerous, so a biopsy would be reasonable. However, if an antibiotic made it go down, I would keep trying that line of approach. I also recommend eating a raw carrot every day to help clean out the intestine.

**Andrew Murray:** There are herbs like *Galium aparine* (cleavers) which are indicated for lymphadenopathy. Poke root is also used but is very strong and potentially toxic, so be careful. *Smilax* (sarsaparilla) and Blue Flag are also lymphatic agents.

**Engineer:** I recommend massaging the area to push the obstruction through.

**Andrew Murray:** I would go easy on the pressure. If there is infection or irritation, too much pressure might cause local irritation. But Dr. Peat’s point about the gut connection is valid; gut issues often manifest as lymphatic swelling in the neck.

## Caller: Stealth Pathogens and Lyme

**Caller (Michael):** What do you think about "stealth pathogens" like Lyme disease as the root cause of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia are so closely related to nutrition and hormones. I think mysterious infections are over-diagnosed. If you think you have been exposed, a good course of the right antibiotics should clear it up in a few weeks.

**Caller (Michael):** Can these pathogens prevent the thyroid from functioning optimally?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ordinary bacteria living in the small intestine—which should be sterile—can cause enough toxicity (endotoxin) to interfere with thyroid function. Keeping the intestine clean is the first step.

**Andrew Murray:** This brings us back to the raw grated carrot. Dr. Peat recommends a daily serving because carrots are indigestible and have a sweeping action on the bowel wall. They absorb excess estrogen and endotoxins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, experiments show that both antibiotics and carrots lower estrogen and cortisol by lowering endotoxin absorption.

## Caller: Follow-up on Lymph Nodes and Thyroid

**Caller (Follow-up):** Regarding the previous caller with the lump—if it was hardening, shouldn't he get a biopsy immediately? Cancer is cured better when caught quickly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it softens and seems normal after taking an antibiotic, that indicates it likely wasn't cancer. Hardness is a very accurate way to diagnose. In breast cancer surgery, they can often diagnose lymph nodes just by feeling if they are hard. If it was hardened cancer, it would stay hard even if antibiotics reduced the surrounding inflammation.

**Caller (Follow-up):** My daughter is in her early 40s and her cholesterol is 260. Is that too high?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is likely expressing low thyroid function. Cholesterol is the precursor to protective hormones like pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA. As thyroid function goes down, cholesterol goes up in a defensive reaction to try to keep the production of those hormones up. When you take thyroid, you start turning that cholesterol into the good hormones, and the cholesterol level goes down.

## Conclusion: Defining Fats

**Engineer:** We have a listener asking you to clarify exactly which are the polyunsaturated oils and which are the saturated oils.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The polyunsaturated fats include mayonnaise, corn oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, hemp seed oil, linseed oil, and fish oil. Olive oil contains about 10% of the potentially dangerous polyunsaturated fat, but it has so much monounsaturated fat that it is relatively safe.

**Andrew Murray:** And the saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are coconut oil, butter, and beef fat.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. For those listening, Dr. Peat can be reached at his website, raypeat.com. Happy Solstice to everyone.
