## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** I want to remind everybody out there listening far and wide that if you do not support your source of information, then you are the product and your brain space is being sold to whoever does support the source of your news and information. So please support whatever local independent news sources that you consume. You have to keep a broader range of viewpoints alive out there, because sooner or later you'll be caught in a cul-de-sac with nowhere to go, and you'll rue the day you didn't support Redwood Community Radio. Without further ado, let's get into *Ask Your Herb Doctor*.

Good evening and welcome to the January 21, 2022 edition of *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show.

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM here from the Redwood Coast of California, broadcasting nationwide and internationally to a wide range of open-minded, perceptive individuals who want to know what's really going on.

Don't forget to listen to the audio archives. Unfortunately, the station only keeps them for a month or two at the most, but our website has at least 10 years of archives. I've got another two years to put up—excuse me for that, it's been a bit busy.

**Speaker A:** I'd like to comment on the archive situation. I thought they used to be held for a lot longer. One of my past hosts called me up saying, "Hey, our organization sent you people," so I was able to tell Simon about that and he was able to give them a special link. They're up there for three months as it is right now. It used to be longer, but there is a way that you can find a quick link to yours and put that on your website. We as programmers should talk to KMUD to try to get it back.

**Andrew Murray:** We record all of them, so they are intended to be put on the website. But the same thing happens—I just get so busy that it slips.

You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* from 7:30 until 8:00. You're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of MSG and cancer, and a continuation of estrogen and its progressively destructive effects and induction of autoimmunity and cancer. We have a bit of a wrap-up from last month to finish, and then we will get started with MSG, glutamate, and the links to cancer and excitotoxicity. There's also a link to COVID and MSG through its negative effects on the immune system.

The number is 707-923-3911. Please go ahead and call up with any questions you have related to this month's subject, or if you have other questions you want to pose to Dr. Peat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us again. Let's make sure you are fully introduced to the audience, perhaps for those who may never have heard you. Let them know a little bit about your expertise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been a student of the humanities, teaching painting and English literature. I got interested in language and how the brain can do such a thing as use language. I decided that the only way to make progress was to go to graduate school in biology and study the brain.

In 1968, I went back to the University of Oregon. I quickly found that the nerve biology section of the department was very dogmatic and cared more about their theories than the actual experimental evidence. In fact, they didn't like to look too much at experimental results if they didn't absolutely fall in line with the theory.

After looking around for several weeks, I checked into many different labs at the university and found that the aging research—specifically reproductive physiology and how it's affected by aging—was the most concerned with finding out what's really happening. I decided to do my dissertation on that, which I finished in 1972: *Age-related oxidative changes in the hamster uterus*.

Surprisingly, that had a huge amount of information relative to brain function. To thoroughly understand what's going on in aging changes and how the organism redesigns cells so that they can start a new life from a single fertilized ovum involves the same principles that you need to look at to see what the brain is doing in relation to behavior and understanding language. One thing led into another, and I've been working on those subjects ever since.

**Andrew Murray:** From a social perspective, I really appreciate you interweaving your artistic nature with a fluid understanding. Mainstream understanding tends to be fairly dogmatic, but you have a very fluid, plastic way of looking at things. It has brought a very wide spotlight on a lot of subjects we've covered.

As I said many times, the archives we've recorded with you for the last 14 years are going to be a living testimony to what's already been confirmed—somewhat reluctantly by some industries because they'd like to keep control of their dominance. But a lot of these things you've been saying have been confirmed, and slowly but surely people are getting a much better understanding of the way things really are.

## Estrogen and Herbal Modulators

**Andrew Murray:** Before we retrace too much, there were several questions I wanted to ask Dr. Peat last month about estrogen, its relationship to autoimmunity, and cancer. Very quickly, I just wanted to cover a couple of things from an herbal perspective surrounding estrogen and aromatase.

Last month I mentioned a cucurbitaceous vine-bearing plant called *Momordica charantia*, which is bitter melon. It has been used to block estrogen and has estrogen-modulating properties. This is an anti-diabetic plant that essentially works with regulating blood glucose.

I also wanted to mention artemisinin, a component of wormwood (*Artemisia annua*). It actually contains not just anti-parasitic, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects, but it's also been shown to reduce the estrogen receptive function in breast cancer cell lines. That's worth people taking a look at on PubMed. Artemisinin does have anti-estrogenic activity.

I wanted to say quickly that tamoxifen may be useful in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, particularly those arising from aberrant helper T1 cell activity, including allograft rejection. It's also been used with some success in Crohn's. But I wanted to bring out that the induced shift away from cellular immunity represents a significant step in fostering a carcinogenic environment. This may limit the anti-cancer effects of tamoxifen and explain why tamoxifen is inferior compared to other anti-estrogens for preventing disease recurrence in early-stage breast tumors.

## MSG, Excitotoxicity, and Obesity

**Andrew Murray:** Let's kick off tonight with the topic of MSG. The Food and Drug Administration has considered it safe to add to food. It's one of the most abundantly found amino acids in nature and is present in a heterogeneous group of foods as a flavor enhancer, known as E621 in the form of hydrolyzed protein or as a purified monosodium salt.

Very early on, they were seemingly demonstrating the benefits of monosodium glutamate as responsible for increasing temperature, decreasing body mass, and decreasing production of fat tissues. They claimed it would be readily taken up, not just because of the umami flavor, but that it conferred metabolic benefits.

I was surprised to find that there was a wide variety of foods—including walnuts, garlic, onion, potatoes—that contain natural glutamate. And then chicken, beef, eggs, human milk, and cow milk have it in fairly large amounts.

However, the negative effect of this glutamate was that it suppressed the oxidation of glucose. I'm wondering about the claims of obesity, whereas before they were talking about how it was going to increase your metabolism and burn fat. Dr. Peat, you've been looking at monosodium glutamate and its excitotoxic effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the weight loss thing was just a sales ploy to sell the flavoring substance. In the 1970s, mostly J.W. Olney found that when rats were fed just a little more than the amount that a person could normally eat in various artificial foods or added as flavoring, the brain was damaged in a certain way that led to lifelong obesity. It caused destruction of enough of the brain that appetite remained out of control and the metabolic rate wasn't sufficient to keep weight steady.

Over a period of several years, he did many experiments, including showing that the same sort of molecule—aspartic acid or aspartame or variations—had this range of excitatory effects as long as it was acting through the glutamate receptor or the aspartate receptor. One of the "positive" things was that it made you seem more alert. But that alertness came at the expense of not having enough energy produced to meet the high energy consumption caused by the excitatory action of the aspartate or glutamate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't aspartate aspartame? Isn't that also like that fake sugar Splenda or something like that?

**Speaker A:** Coke uses NutraSweet. It's aspartic acid with methanol, and then it degrades into methanol and leaves methanol in your neurons.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Oh yeah, that's a nasty chemical.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspartame is a super sweet material, sweeter than saccharin, but the amount that is toxic is very small. They've demonstrated that it can cause brain cancer. Olney, among others in the late 70s, showed that the sudden appearance of a rising incidence of gliomas—malignant glial cell tumors, brain cancer—could be caused by overfeeding glutamates or MSG to animals. The rise in the population incidence and mortality from these tumors followed by a few years the introduction of foods that were loaded with everything from aspartame to MSG.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This goes to show we can't trust the ethics of the FDA if they're allowing that product on the market.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cell phones have corresponded as well. For example, if a person habitually holds their cell phone to the right ear, the incidence of brain tumors on the right side has increased sharply since the use of cell phones. It happens that they are both causes of excitotoxicity. The electromagnetic field excites the cells, and you need to provide energy to keep up with that, or the cell dies.

Ongoing experiments show that when cells are endangered by such things as MSG or aspartame, if you intervene by giving them a super amount of sugar—glucose or other sugar—it will save the neurons simply by feeding whatever is needed to keep up with the high level of excitation.

This is the image of the excitotoxic conflict: unavoidable stimulation of excitation combined with something interfering with the oxidation of glucose. That isn't applicable only to aging and gliomas; it applies to epilepsy, for example. If the cells aren't able to keep up their energy production with the excitation, the seizure gets out of control and damages the tissue.

It isn't just nerve cells, though they are the most obvious. Any cell that can be exaggeratedly stimulated can be rescued if you keep the sugar supply up. But if it isn't kept up, then that cell can become cancerous, form tumors, or just die, leading to dementia or various types of brain function loss.

**Andrew Murray:** This is like a kind of wasteful entropy. There's a lack of input of the energy needed to keep the cell going.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and it's made worse by overlapping influences. It isn't just cell phone radiation and aspartame and MSG, but many different things all have that same function.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So eating Chinese food with MSG, drinking a diet soda, plus talking on your cell phone holding it up to your head...

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And if you look at what any stress does—no matter what you're doing to yourself, vibration, laser overstimulation, telephone overstimulation, or even simply glucose deprivation or oxygen deprivation—they all turn out to be excitatory.

**Andrew Murray:** I think to coin the term "wasteful" was probably a good way for people listening to understand the term "excitatory." It's a very wasteful blowing off of your energy with inefficient processes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It happens that the feeding of energy in the form of sugar has a sedative action that leads to turning down the degree of excitation.

Any harmful influence—oxygen or glucose deprivation, temperature too cold or too hot—turns out to activate a whole range of short-term solutions if the cell perceives that it is not getting enough energy to meet the needs.

One alternative is to try to go into hibernation to turn off its own needs for energy. To do that, it has the equipment for producing serotonin, which will help to prevent loss of heat through the skin, but it also turns down the production of heat. It leads to a colder and colder state—suspended animation to a degree.

Another universal basic reaction is the formation of histamine. When a cell is in desperate, dying conditions, it forms and secretes histamine into its environment because the histamine will open up any closed blood vessels and get more blood delivered.

Estrogen is another of these short-term emergency things. The estrogen in turn can activate the serotonin system and cool off the whole energy-consuming apparatus. It can activate the histamine system. It activates nitric oxide formation that opens up the blood vessels the same way histamine does. And it can activate heme oxygenase, which breaks down heme. Breaking down the heme will provide some antioxidant function—bilirubin and carbon monoxide are produced. Under these circumstances, the carbon monoxide can serve as an antioxidant, blocking the ability to consume oxygen and so moving the system into a torpor or hibernation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's all lots of inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** Lots of wasteful mechanisms to deplete the organism of energy and further send the cell into a desperate state.

## Protein Consumption and Natural Glutamates

**Speaker A:** My understanding is that the glutamate, or the Accent flavor, is stimulating the umami flavor, and a lot of high protein and other nutritious foods stimulate that too. How is it that the body is able to be benefited by eating a nice high-protein diet?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes, hydrolyzed protein, whey, soy protein, and a lot of those products are big sources of MSG. Dr. Peat, how about the flavoring side of MSG versus its natural presence in the diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the natural state, protein is a rare delicacy for most animals. The urge to eat some protein is a definite survival urge—you want to build muscle, make new tissue, and so on. But the trouble is when society provides lots of cheap protein, people get in the habit of not being guided by their appetite and cravings, but just eating it because it's there. Even because it's considered the most valuable food, people tend to overeat on protein after they're around the age of 20 or so.

As their growth slows down, they tend to keep eating for the 15-year-old they were. As long as you're growing, you respond to the signal action of the glutamate. You go into an anabolic state and pick up all of those individual amino acids and make muscle and brain tissue. But once your size is established, if you keep eating that same amount, you're going to have a lot of excess beyond your needs. Excess histidine, tryptophan, methionine, cysteine, aspartate, glutamate—all of these are potentially excitotoxic amino acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when you recommend people consume 75 to 100 grams of protein a day, you're not recommending they consume that all in the form of muscle meat or eggs. You typically don't recommend more than two eggs a day, and most of your protein requirements you believe should be coming from dairy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. After you're grown up, you should try to learn to go by your actual biological urges rather than what advertising tells you to eat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So how many ounces of a muscle protein—whether it's fish, shellfish, meat, chicken—would you recommend is a safe level for adults?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As your metabolic rate slows down—and that happens steadily from puberty—the older you are, the more careful you have to be about having an excess of the excitotoxic amino acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So I guess it's just based upon your activity level and your age.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was Adelle Davis who pointed out that gelatin is considered an incomplete protein because animals and people can't grow if they aren't getting the amino acids lacking in gelatin. But she said she had seen lots of old women going for years living on a diet of toast, Jell-O, and tea—practically their only protein being the gelatin. That was just an illustration of what a very tiny amount a very old person needs.

## MSG Labeling and Neuroprotection

**Andrew Murray:** I pulled out an article describing the exposure of rats to monosodium glutamate at the neonatal stage. It severely damaged their hypothalamic nuclei, which resulted in increased body weight, fat deposition, decreased motor activity, and decreased secretion of growth hormone. MSG appears to be a suitable candidate for inducing obesity which leads to diabetes.

Funnily enough, the FDA is still behind it. They haven't thrown it out. I was very surprised that even things like human milk and cow milk had some of the monosodium glutamate component in it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wonder if it's allowed to be in products without being listed as an additive. Dr. Peat, do you know anything about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think legally it has to be listed. They have some alternatives, like calling it a "vegetable broth" or something when it's really an MSG extracted from soybean.

**Speaker A:** Can it be "natural flavor" if it's less than a certain percentage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I suppose so.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about Tamari? Tamari is a wheat-free soy sauce made of fermented soy protein. Doesn't that form a natural MSG as well? Is that something that should be limited in someone's diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an article stating that curcumin from turmeric protects against monosodium glutamate neurotoxicity by decreasing NMDA2B expression in the rat hippocampus. That's another good plus point for turmeric and its anti-inflammatory activity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are lots of flavonoids like quercetin and myricetin in coffee. Coffee has lots of tissue-protective, anti-cancer, anti-dementia effects that I think are largely an effect of the flavonoid components.

**Andrew Murray:** Another article mentioned the vital role of the hippocampus in memory formation and regulation of behavior, showing that glutamate was involved in increasing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines—like tumor necrosis factor alpha—which contributes to brain damage and the death of neurons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There has been a lot of study of how the excitotoxic things like glutamate actually make the cell become more active. They assumed for many of the studies that glucose was somehow able to reduce the uptake or retention by the cell of the excitotoxic agent. But a more detailed study found that the cells were being protected by high glucose addition without changing the concentration of aspartate or glutamate inside the cell.

What was happening was that normally, the process of responding to the excitotoxin means that the cell is taking up and retaining the excitatory molecule calcium, which should be an extracellular molecule. When the cell retains too much, it goes into the excited, inflamed, energy-wasting state.

They found that the addition of extra glucose allowed the cell to extrude more calcium as it continued to metabolize. Apparently, the mechanism is that glucose promotes the increase of carbon dioxide formation as it's metabolized. The carbon dioxide forming carbonic acid leaves the cell and takes with it the counter ion—the doubly positively charged calcium and some sodium. So the flow of glucose/carbonic acid out of the cell is taking care of the calcium accumulation, which is the basic cause of the inflammation, pain, and cell death.

**Andrew Murray:** Let me just quickly outline the typical foods that are glutamate-rich. It's not a bash at vegetarians, but it just so happens that hydrolyzed vegetable protein is very high in glutamate. Autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extracts, soy extracts, and protein isolate are all very high in glutamate. These form a fairly large part of a vegetarian or vegan diet as an alternative protein source.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah, a lot of bouillons, even if they're organic, have a yeast extract. I notice if I use that, I feel like I've had an MSG burn on my tongue.

## Caller Q&A: Inflammation and Aging

**Caller 1 (Kevin):** I live on the Avenue of the Giants where I pick up trash. Can you explain inflammation? Is it inflammation of the cells or inflammation around the muscle tissue, particularly regarding arthritis and the aches and pains of getting older?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People in recent years have been talking about "inflammaging," as if that explains something. The process of aging obviously involves increased inflammation in every sense we know. But the problem is to see what the basic events are in cell structure, pain, excitation, inflammation, and aging. All have these aspects of cytotoxic cell damage and the inability to remedy the problem by making enough energy or delivering enough energy.

Regarding heme oxygenation—one of the emergency enzymes that produces carbon monoxide—probably 95% of the publications describe carbon monoxide as an antioxidant, very protective, and so on. But if you look at the deteriorated brain in old age, there is more carbon monoxide in it than at any previous life stage. Carbon monoxide presence is a degenerative aspect of inflammation and cell deterioration.

If you block the formation of nitric oxide—for example, in a traumatic wound to the head or spinal cord—or if you block the formation of carbon monoxide, you prevent most of the damage development, edema, and cell death. So the chemistry of aging, inflammation, and deterioration is a complex of things that express the same idea as excitotoxicity.

**Andrew Murray:** Wasteful energy processes.

## Caller Q&A: Reversing Damage and Fibroids

**Caller 2:** I'm from South Central Los Angeles. How long does the body take to heal from all the damage? Let's say you reduce all the estrogen, the polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), and all the inflammatory things. Is there a difference in age or is it the same for everyone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The young person with the higher metabolic rate can change everything more quickly. For the average person, if you move from a country that eats a lot of polyunsaturated fats to a country that eats very little of them, it can take four years to equilibrate to the new balance in the diet.

But if you make an extreme effort... one of the early researchers in the supposed essentiality of polyunsaturated fat demonstrated that he would get sick if he ate a laboratory purified diet absolutely lacking polyunsaturated fats. But about three or four months into the diet, all of his chronic health problems disappeared—chronic migraine and other symptoms—and stayed away. In his case, with an extreme avoidance of just one harmful nutrient, his lifelong problems disappeared in just a few months.

**Caller 2:** Would that also apply if you reduce things to get rid of estrogen? My wife suffers from fibroids and has had a couple of miscarriages because of the fibroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. A friend of mine who was 40 and wanted to get pregnant had a tennis ball-sized fibroid blocking the end of her uterus so the tubes couldn't open to deliver the ovum. She took an overdose of thyroid. Every month the doctor—besides telling her she was going to die from taking too much thyroid—made an image showing that the fibroid was shrunken. Every month it got smaller. I think it was about the fifth month it had become about a fourth of its original size and she was pregnant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So five months made a big difference just by using natural thyroid hormone, lowering her estrogen, and improving her liver function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And there are so many other out-of-balance components of diet. Too much iron in most people's food, too much methionine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine. By fixing any one component, you can see drastic effects. So if you fixed half a dozen of these things that are out of balance, it should produce very huge effects quickly.

## Caller Q&A: Intestinal Bleeding in a Child

**Caller 3:** I'm from Arcata. I have a young grandson, age nine, who has had two episodes of big intestinal bleeding. He's had every scope of his upper and lower GI done, not finding anything. They figure it's something called Meckel's diverticulum, some lesion in the small intestine. Could you recommend any foods that would be soothing to the GI tract?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People vary in their sensitivities. But the first thing to do would be to absolutely avoid foods that have added gums, especially carrageenan. A very high percentage of foods now contain vegetable gums, microbial gums, or carrageenan, all of which are very pro-inflammatory. Just knocking out those foods can stop things like chronic bowel bleeding.

**Caller 3:** Would aloe vera or slippery elm be some kind of panacea to help be soothing?

**Andrew Murray:** Just straight off the top—it might sound a little mild—but in Germany and England where I studied herbal medicine, chamomile was the number one GI anti-inflammatory. It's got a fairly pronounced effect in blocking inflammation and soothing the GI tract. Chamomile is the "mother of the gut." That would be one of the first things I would give somebody.

Depending on what kind of bleeding we're talking about, gentle tannins would also be indicated to gently astringe the capillaries or tissues leaking blood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that can be as simple as black tea or green tea.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, black tea would be totally indicated, as would many other astringent-containing herbs like potentilla.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very important to check his thyroid and vitamin D levels because a deficiency of either of those can make the intestine hypersensitive to inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** If you haven't already done it, obviously his hemoglobin should be looked at. If he's had long-term chronic bleeding, he'd be anemic, and that's going to be a negative factor for his energy. To support that, use plenty of foods that contain naturally present iron rather than any iron supplement. As Dr. Peat mentioned, iron is very reactive and inflammatory. Go with foods that would be iron-rich, like liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And avoid synthetic vitamin C. The synthetic vitamin C reacts with the traces of iron in your body to produce inflammation.

## Caller Q&A: Dental Cavities

**Caller 4:** I'm from Queens, New York. What are the basic consequences of not filling a cavity? Is there any damage to the nervous system that takes place if you leave a cavity unfilled?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Consider if the damage is only into the enamel—that can be remineralized. But once it enters into the dentine, then it really needs to be filled.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We see a holistic dentist in Medford, Oregon, and he recommends Lugol's iodine for those cavities that are just invading the enamel rather than going all the way into the dentine. He said because it's so close on the periodic table of elements to fluoride, but is not neurotoxic like fluoride is, it's a safe alternative. Besides being antimicrobial, a low percentage solution of Lugol's iodine is very helpful for remineralizing superficial cavities.

**Speaker A:** And I'll throw a plug out there for flossing. As one wise person said, "Floss only those teeth you wish to keep."

## Closing Thoughts

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to get this information out for people to take a look at. I looked up a researcher named Blalock. In the *International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research* dated January 2021, I saw an interesting article titled "Excitotoxicity and Immuno-excitotoxicity as a Critical Component of the Cytokine Storm Reaction in Pulmonary Viral Infection, including SARS-CoV-2."

It basically stated that this hyper-immune state secondary to dysregulation of the immune system was ultimately causative for the cytokine storm. A researcher named Morimoto found that co-injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)—which is a very negative substance in the body—plus the NMDA agonist ibotenic acid (from *Amanita muscaria*) caused significant neuronal damage through the excitotoxic arm of the reaction.

I just want to read out one last thing before we close the show. Europe and Britain have lifted the mandate for everything related to COVID.

Authoritarianism and the age of acceptance: have it all and have nothing. We're evolving as a species and with our evolution comes a concept of deranged acceptance. Nature is not accepting, but rather through evolutionary pressure it selects the fittest and is quite barbaric. It takes no prisoners and is quite merciless. Rules exist and nature obeys them. They are set from the foundation of the world, which we recently have also learned to meddle with and derange—like viruses and gain-of-function research.

The opposite, perhaps, of the all-encompassing embrace of "everything is allowable" are the immutable laws set in place which we're constrained to, like time, gravity, and death. Authoritarianism is at odds with our founding fathers' constitution of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which is a God-ordained decree, immutable and self-evident.

Like gain-of-function research and authoritarianism, these are set at odds with their counterpart and are to be resisted with your life. Life demands that fitness be preserved and aims at physical and spiritual health. I put it to you that with increasing authoritarianism and draconian legislation aimed at making us happier to coexist with everything, accept everything, have no boundaries, and have no morals... I leave you with this: Have at it, or resist and live.

Until the third Friday of next month, my name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you for listening.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
