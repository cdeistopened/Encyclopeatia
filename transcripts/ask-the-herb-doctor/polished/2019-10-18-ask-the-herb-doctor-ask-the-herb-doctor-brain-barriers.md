## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. This is the October 2019 broadcast. For over 10 years, we've been doing our monthly call-in show covering the loose topic of alternative holistic medicine with Dr. Raymond Peat. For those who have read his articles, newsletters, or books, you understand that he is a deep thinker with a broad educational background in physiological processes.

Tonight, we are discussing false narratives—misconceptions about things we are told are one way, but when we look at the science, they are actually not. We will continue discussing Dr. Peat's writing on serotonin. The lines are open at 707-923-3911.

Let's go ahead and introduce Dr. Peat. Thanks for joining us. For those who haven't heard your work, could you give us a rundown of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My first teaching job was in biology, but I had been studying linguistics and the humanities. I taught in those areas for about 10 years after getting my master's degree. Then I went back to get a PhD in biology at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. Since then, I've been following up on interests I had all through the 1960s in biology, brain function, and how social interaction and environmental influences affect our biology.

## The Blood-Brain Barrier Myth

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss misconceptions. We are often told about the blood-brain barrier—that the pia mater, dura mater, and arachnoid mater form meninges to keep pathogens and toxins out. However, we know things like cysts can get into the brain. You have a very fluid understanding of the body. How do you understand the blood-brain barrier and its function?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It relates to the general idea of the integrity of tissue and cells. When something goes wrong with the tissue—an energy failure, for example—any tissue loses its barrier function or integrity; things inside leak out, and things outside can get in.

Every cell, when it is in a highly energized state, has a cytoplasm with a fat-loving (hydrophobic) property. The idea of a membrane barrier on the surface of a cell is really a myth. Gilbert Ling spent 40 or 50 years disproving that myth, showing that it is the structure of the cytoplasm that creates a barrier. Russian researchers in the middle of the last century showed that the energy level of the cell governs its barrier function. In a high-energy state, the cell takes up fat easily; when de-energized, a water-soluble dye will leak in.

About 50 years ago, researchers demonstrated in rats that the lipid-loving quality of the brain governs the so-called barrier function. The brain lives at a very high energy state, making it more hydrophobic. Researchers put an emulsion of soy oil into the carotid artery of a rat and measured the blood draining from the brain. They found that on a single pass, 17% of this fat was taken up from the blood.

**Andrew Murray:** So, stress plays a role here?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you are under stress, your blood becomes loaded with unbound free fatty acids traveling on albumin. Hormones also travel on albumin. Under stress, increased free fatty acids displace those hormones, and the albumin delivers large amounts of free fatty acids or fat-soluble hormones to the capillaries serving the brain.

People resisted the idea that hormones could freely get into the brain without a special transporter, but albumin can deliver its burden right into the brain. For example, regarding the water solubility of tryptophan, people insist that the huge amount of tryptophan produced in the intestine can't get into the brain to influence behavior. However, patients with carcinoid tumors—which produce huge amounts of serotonin—experience emotional turmoil, skin vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and extreme emotional ups and downs corresponding to surges of serotonin.

Serotonin itself powerfully breaks down barriers, including the blood-brain barrier. The lungs and the brain are best equipped with enzymes to destroy serotonin. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is very concentrated in these capillaries. Normally, the MAO should detoxify the serotonin reaching the brain. But under nutritional stress or high estrogen—which inhibits MAO—the capillaries fail to detoxify the serotonin. The serotonin is then free to enter and disturb brain function.

## The Cell Membrane and Electron Microscopy

**Andrew Murray:** Does the bi-lipid membrane exist? We are taught that hydrophobic and hydrophilic components line up to form a barrier. Is that a reality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an early 19th-century medical book, I saw that the treatment for a burn or ulcer was osmic acid (osmium tetroxide) to create what they called a "false membrane." When the first electron microscopes started looking at cells, they didn't find the membrane they had theorized. Meanwhile, Gilbert Ling was demonstrating why the cell behaves electrically without needing a membrane.

However, someone discovered they could use this osmic acid "false membrane creator" to produce a visible membrane on cells consistent with current theories. At first, the membrane appeared very thick to suit the theory of the time. As the tendency towards the lipid bilayer theory took root, they adjusted their membrane-making technology to suit the idea of a single bilayer. When I was taking a course in electron microscopy, I tried different stains and found I could make a cell look like an onion—membranes all the way through.

**Andrew Murray:** It reminds me of viral inclusions in virology, where scanning electron micrographs often show things that are fabricated or artifactual.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Harold Hillman, who died not long ago, wrote books showing how official biology is largely artifact.

## Hypothyroidism and Muscle Damage

**Andrew Murray:** The brain is energy-hungry and lipid-rich. The blood-brain barrier isn't a mechanical wall but depends on the energetic reserves of the organism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When energy breaks down, you get diseases based on excess permeability—the breakdown of the barrier function—such as multiple sclerosis.

**Andrew Murray:** This relates to estrogen producing leakiness and edema.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I received an email from a woman who had extremely high creatine phosphokinase (CPK)—a muscle breakdown enzyme—and very high Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Her doctor assured her the muscle leaking couldn't be related to hypothyroidism and must be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmunity is a great medical business now, while fixing thyroid function isn't of much interest.

However, the knowledge that hypothyroidism causes muscle disease goes back 100 years. It was a diagnostic basis for hypothyroidism if a person had swollen muscles. Old textbooks showed children with massively swollen muscles; when given thyroid hormone, the muscles returned to normal.

**Andrew Murray:** Is that swelling due to edema?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If your thyroid is low, the muscle gets hot and swells up with very little or no effort.

**Andrew Murray:** That makes me think of chronic wasting disease. Is that an energy-wasting process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid hormone is our basic anabolic hormone. Around 1960, Hans Selye was working on muscular dystrophy. He could experimentally produce muscular dystrophy just by giving an animal serotonin. When thyroid function goes down, serotonin goes up. Either removing the thyroid or giving serotonin causes the energy failure that leads to a breakdown of the barrier function, leaking of substance, and eventually atrophy.

## Caller: SSRI Withdrawal

**Caller:** I am in Trinidad, California. Is there any hope for getting off the SSRI Lexapro? I have been on it for 17 years. Every time I try to wean off, it triggers deep sadness and extreme highs and lows.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the chronic effects of serotonin promotion is interference with cellular reproductive respiration. That should be under the control of the thyroid, but it gradually becomes depleted, and glycolytic energy production tends to replace it. You have to reactivate oxidative metabolism while suppressing glycolysis and lactic acid production.

Carbon dioxide is a main regulator of metabolism; it helps keep serotonin under control, keeps oxidation running, and suppresses lactic acid. Working on everything connected to thyroid function—including calcium and Vitamin D—will gradually wean you away from the stimulation that comes from the SSRI.

**Andrew Murray:** This sounds like a candidate for self-assessing metabolic rate via temperature and pulse, then using thyroid hormone, adequate dietary sugars, and withdrawing from polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs).

## Caller: Prednisone Withdrawal

**Caller:** I'm from Utah. I have a family member who has been taking 5mg of prednisone for several years for rheumatoid arthritis. They want to get off it but seem reliant. What is a strategy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Behind the original diagnosis, there was probably a Vitamin D deficiency or low thyroid function. Serotonin is elevated in all the so-called autoimmune diseases. Correcting the energy problem with calcium, Vitamin D, and thyroid is usually the basis for correcting the original symptoms.

**Caller:** How would you feel about using pregnenolone or other hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've known several people who were addicted to glucocorticoids like prednisone who used progesterone or pregnenolone to taper off in just a few weeks.

## Caller: Stress and Milk Cravings

**Caller:** I'm in Garberville. I've been under a lot of stress with aches, pains, and low mood. Anecdotally, I've been craving milk, especially in the middle of the night. Is my stressed-out state depressing my thyroid, making my body want calcium and Vitamin D?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Disregarding the cause of the stress, all stress hormones rise at night simply because of the darkness. Serotonin activates every pituitary hormone, and those all rise during the night. Calcium, sugar, and thyroid are the three crucial things for minimizing that nocturnal rise of stress.

**Andrew Murray:** Milk is a very good idea prior to bedtime because of the calcium and potential Vitamin D.

## Caller: PUFA, Exercise, and Thyroid Testing

**Caller:** I'm calling from New York. First, regarding PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) accumulating with age: Is this mitigated by taking Vitamin E? Since it's hard to calculate PUFA intake, should we take small amounts of Vitamin E? I know you don't take it orally.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I use it on my skin because it irritates my digestive system to take it orally, but I think it is good to take a little bit of it.

**Caller:** Second, regarding CO2 and running. Assuming you are healthy, running increases CO2 initially, but once you fatigue, you go over a level. Do you agree that initially, it increases CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Until you increase your lactic acid. That is the first sign that you are damaging yourself.

**Caller:** A friend takes a CO2 dry bath immediately after running to mitigate damage. Does that help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A CO2 bath is good for almost any condition, especially if you are at the point of making lactic acid. It helps you recover quickly.

**Caller:** Regarding thyroid testing, Broda Barnes used temperature. But given your depth of knowledge, there must be a better way.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oxygen consumption is by far the best. You might find old medical equipment for measuring Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) online. It was used globally for diagnosing hypothyroidism. According to that method, 30% of Americans were hypothyroid in 1940. If you use that apparatus now, it's more like 60%.

**Caller:** What about pulse and blood pressure? If someone has a stable blood pressure of 120/80 even after standing up, but a low pulse (around 60) that doesn't rise easily, what does that indicate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A stable blood pressure usually means very good nervous system regulation. However, I've known a few people who can't increase their pulse even with exercise. That would be a good argument for measuring your oxygen consumption, because there is no other explanation for low oxygen consumption than a need for more thyroid. Cholesterol is another good indicator.

**Caller:** My doctor wanted to put me on statins for a cholesterol of 330. I refused, took thyroid, increased salt, and did what you suggested. It dropped 150 points in nine weeks. The doctor was amazed.

## Caller: Fun vs. Boring Exercise

**Caller:** I'm from Utah again. I notice sports like basketball or soccer are way more fun than something that doesn't involve exertion. Is the reliance on high-exertion sports a symptom of an unideal environment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the experience of having fun or doing something meaningful powerfully overrides the toxic effects of lactic acid and serotonin. It can push things back into shape just because that's how the organism builds itself—doing meaningful things and having fun. Work should ideally be a fun exercise, but if you don't have that in your working activities, it's good to have the game type of exercise.

## Learned Helplessness and Diagnosis

**Andrew Murray:** I read earlier that "learned helplessness" in animal models is mediated by too much serotonin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it can be brought on by anything that overwhelms your self-regulation. I think a diagnosis often creates a learned helplessness situation, and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.

**Andrew Murray:** I've long said a diagnosis is the worst thing a person can get. Energetically, it destroys you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong in some of its explanations, and it makes you think of yourself as a machine that needs fixing.

## The Antioxidant Myth

**Andrew Murray:** We have a few minutes left. Let's touch on the antioxidant myth. We are told oxidation is bad—like a cut apple turning brown—and antioxidants are good. What is the reality?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One thing to keep in mind is that cancer cells have a very powerful intrinsic antioxidant system. To restore health, you often want to overcome that antioxidant system.

Down syndrome provides another example. The crucial genetic problem is likely a huge overdose of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). When you add this extra gene for SOD to animals or cells, it creates accelerated aging, similar to Down syndrome or Alzheimer's.

The normal function of superoxide—which is just an oxygen molecule with an extra electron—seems to be the active agent in the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme for destroying serotonin. In Down syndrome, the excess SOD removes the superoxide. Consequently, the platelet is unable to destroy serotonin. The person becomes saturated with free serotonin because the system isn't able to destroy it at a normal speed.

**Andrew Murray:** That is interesting. I know Trisomy 21 involves an extra copy of chromosome 21, which encodes for SOD, but also for beta-amyloid precursors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Amyloid protein accumulates in many conditions where you are simply hypothyroid or under stress. But the spectacular defect in Down syndrome is the failure of the platelet to oxidize serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time. Thank you for joining us, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
