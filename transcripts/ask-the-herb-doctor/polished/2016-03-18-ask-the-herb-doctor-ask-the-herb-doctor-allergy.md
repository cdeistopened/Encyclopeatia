## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to the show. You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD Garberville. My name is Andrew Murray. My wife is not here this evening, but we are both licensed medical herbalists who graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine. We advise clients with a wide range of conditions using herbal, dietary, and lifestyle advice.

Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us again this month. The topic is broadly encompassing allergy. It is a pertinent time of year; the clocks have gone forward, we are on summertime, and things are starting to flower. Soon the grasses will be flowering, although that is not the only source of allergy-related effects. There are plenty of other allergies, both food and environmental.

Dr. Peat is going to share his insights into the mechanisms of allergy. You probably won't have heard some of what he is going to say because, while some of it is very old material, it hasn't been accepted by the mainstream. Dr. Peat's rationale on the subject is both fascinating and insightful. Thanks for joining us again, Dr. Peat. For those who haven't heard of you, would you outline your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After I had studied humanities and linguistics for a while, I decided to study biology. I spent four years, 1968 to 1972, studying for a PhD at the University of Oregon. In 1969, I attended their International Immunology Conference. Seeing some of the most famous immunologists in the world, I became skeptical of the standard theories of immunity because they were ignoring some of the papers given at that conference in favor of staying with the stereotyped, official dogma.

**Andrew Murray:** You have done a lot of your own research looking at the reality of the science behind cause and effect. Some of your explanations have been borne out in mainstream science recently.

## The Mechanism of Allergy: IgE vs. Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Starting off with the medical model of allergy, I’ve understood that IgE is the main mediated antibody product that causes the recognition and reactive processes leading to inflammation. Do you see IgE as the main cause, or do you disagree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think one of the reasons it gets so much attention is that it fits with a hereditary idea of susceptibility to allergy and other diseases. The facts are that it is as much an effect of allergy as it is a cause. For example, it's known that the determination of the B cells—bone-derived white blood cells—to make the IgE type of antibody is determined by signals in the body.

Histamine is probably the most effective signal in telling the B cells to start making the IgE antibody. If you don't have inflammation from the stressed cells producing histamine, you won't be likely to have so much IgE.

One of the things that turns on the production of more mast cells, or the secretion of histamine from the mast cells, is prostaglandins produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially prostaglandin E2. Over the last 15 or 20 years, researchers have seen that allergic women have babies born with higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content, and those babies are more likely to develop allergies at an early age.

The polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease the LDL—so-called "bad" cholesterol—and increase the HDL. HDL is associated with allergy, while higher LDL is associated with less likelihood of allergy. PUFA and HDL, the supposedly good things which have been increasingly promoted, are believed by quite a few allergists now to be responsible for the great increase in allergy in Europe and America.

**Andrew Murray:** Because they're signaling for inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They increase the prostaglandins, which increase histamine production.

**Andrew Murray:** These free fatty acids are the same ones you often talk about as being important to keep down because they are both inflammatory and destructive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Besides making the prostaglandins, they cause changes in cells that disrupt their functions. Every function of the cell can be disrupted by too much of the polyunsaturated fats. One of the worst things they do is interrupt oxidative metabolism. The energy deficit is ultimately the thing that leads to really serious allergy problems.

## Energy Production and Sugar

**Andrew Murray:** When you talk about energy production, I think of the mitochondria—the powerhouse of the cell—and thyroid and progesterone being supportive nutrients for it. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Babies and very young children can oxidize fatty acids very quickly and get good energy from them. But in proportion to how unsaturated the fats are, over the years they slow down the ability to oxidize anything. Sugar, or glucose, doesn't do that. Glucose doesn't cause the great problems with metabolism and energy production.

**Andrew Murray:** So there is a cumulative effect with free fatty acid buildup that leads to a decrease in energy. That energy decrease is responsible for the arrival of inflammatory mediators triggered by things people wouldn't normally be allergic to.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40 or 50 years ago, people associated with Hans Selye in Canada did research on allergy and the shock produced by allergens. In one study, they graded allergens from the potentially deadly walnut oil down to mild allergens like pollen. They gave that range of allergens to animals that had glucose infused into their bloodstream to give them two to three times the normal concentration. Even the most deadly allergen didn't do anything worse than maybe give them the sniffles when they had high blood sugar. But if they gave them a little insulin to lower their blood sugar, the mildest allergen could kill them with anaphylactic shock.

**Andrew Murray:** So sugar is a stress-reducing substance that prevents that cascade from occurring.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Lots of people have been able to give up their EpiPens just by keeping a Coke on hand. If they are stung by a bee they are allergic to, they drink a Coke quickly.

**Andrew Murray:** It is interesting that the industry wants to demonize things shown to be beneficial. Sugar is important not just for energy production, but for vitalizing the cell and directly reducing inflammation. Do you remember the specific amount of sugar mentioned in those studies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 300 milligrams percent was the completely protective level.

**Andrew Murray:** When most people think about sugar, they've been told how bad it is regarding diabetes. But we know the cause for diabetes has nothing to do with sugar; it involves high fructose corn syrup and polyunsaturates.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you give animals extra glucose, it is able to get around the polyunsaturated fatty acid interference with energy production. It can turn off the production of fatty acids and get directly to the mitochondria to produce energy.

## Stress and Learned Helplessness

**Andrew Murray:** The underlying pathophysiology of allergy involves immunoregulatory dysfunction similar to that noted in highly stressed populations. Allergies have been considered psychosomatic and worsen in patients with high psychosocial stress. How do you see stress modulating the allergy response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Remember we talked about learned helplessness? Stress that you can't escape from—even if it's not a very deadly stress—becomes deadly because you can't mobilize the anti-stress system. You get stuck in the cholinergic or parasympathetic side of the system, which tends to slow your heartbeat and weaken defenses. It puts you in a condition predisposed to inflammation.

When they looked at people with inflammatory diseases, it turned out that socioeconomic status is additive to any particular learned helplessness situation. A person with a bad condition is less likely to survive if they have low socioeconomic status. But if they have overcome learned helplessness, they can also overcome their socioeconomic status. Learned helplessness plus low income makes you very susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, dementia, and so on.

**Andrew Murray:** How can people best overcome that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An enriched environment is how they made animals overcome it. In humans, anything that gets you out of the trapped sensation and makes your life interesting helps. Any life-enriching experience—meeting new people, going new places—helps to break out of those patterns.

**Andrew Murray:** For people allergic to pollen, what is the best advice for combating allergies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It turns out that the same things that cure or help escape from learned helplessness also help to stop the inflammatory reaction and reduce histamine production. T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, was one of the early things discovered to cure learned helplessness. It does several things that prevent overproduction of histamine. It's been known to be anti-inflammatory for a long time, but one of its mechanisms is to stabilize mast cells so they don't secrete serotonin, histamine, and other inflammatory substances.

## Gut Health and Allergies

**Andrew Murray:** What is your rationale for the gut-derived link between inhaled allergens and allergy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes the inflammation in a particular area, like the nose, ears, throat, or eyes, is really something irritating your intestine. You can develop IgE antibodies solely in your nasal membranes without having it in your general bloodstream, so you can have a local reaction. But usually, people getting these throat and nose inflammations have it start from something happening in the intestine. This triggers mast cells, which are very numerous in the lining of the intestine, to produce histamine, serotonin, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins systemically. Those circulate to cause inflammation in all membranes.

Avoiding things that feed bacteria so that you don't produce so much endotoxin can help all types of allergy and inflammatory conditions. The standard theory used to say that only a protein is a potential allergen, but there is perfect evidence that many things that don't contain protein are powerful allergens. For example, the alginate dentists use for making molds of the mouth.

**Andrew Murray:** Alginate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a cousin of carrageenan, which is now in so many foods. One person died of anaphylactic shock while having a mold made with alginate. It's a polysaccharide. Lots of gums like guar, locust bean gum, and xanthan gum are allergens for some people, but they are used indiscriminately in food today.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think this food-based dietary involvement could be additive, where people get worse because their diet doesn't change?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think this is probably the worst cause of learned helplessness in the biological sense. Your body experiences that inflammatory state, which is psychological as much as biological.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you advocate whole food approaches like good quality dairy products.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Calcium and Vitamin D are very strongly anti-allergic. Magnesium is the most famous because a deficiency causes a range of inflammatory diseases. You could cure skin diseases, heart disease, nerve disease, and liver disease just by correcting a magnesium deficiency. Vitamin D and calcium work with magnesium. Some people cure their allergies just by supplementing Vitamin D or Vitamin K.

## Caller: Colds vs. Allergies

**Caller (David):** Do you think there is confusion regarding the common cold being in the same category as an allergy? Around the holidays, people have reduced sunlight, eat unhealthy food, are stressed, and everyone gets a cold. Also, why is mucus a major part of both? Is that the body's intelligence trying to throw off the allergens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mucus binds histamine and keeps it away from the cells, and binds other toxins and irritants. It's our first line of defense against allergens and viruses.

I think there is a great similarity between the variety of viruses that like to attack the intestine. Things we think of as respiratory viruses, I think, are primarily intestinal viruses. Polio, in one of its manifestations, was really just a gastrointestinal infection. The famous gastroenterologist Walter Alvarez experimented on dogs about 80 years ago. When he gave them a respiratory virus, he found they would get a runny nose and inflammation in their head without any virus present in their nose. He found the virus was growing in their intestine and producing symptoms in the upper respiratory system. Later, if they didn't throw it off, the virus would show up all through their system.

What seems to be a nose cold is often irritation in the intestine. I've seen people who learned that at the first sign of a cold—sore throat or runny nose—if they ate a carrot, they could break the pattern and not develop the cold.

**Caller (David):** Doctors prescribe antibiotics for colds, saying it's for a secondary infection. Based on what we've learned from you, is that actually a good thing because it attacks the endotoxin issue in the intestine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think so. You usually don't need the standard dose to clear out a bowel infection if it has just come on. Sometimes a third of the standard dose of penicillin, tetracycline, or erythromycin will work.

**Caller (David):** Do antihistamines disrupt the intelligence of the body getting these allergens out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes they can break the pattern. Vitamin E has an antihistamine effect; it prevents the formation of prostaglandins and consequently prevents the degranulation of mast cells. It can prevent the shift to the IgE antibody. Even various antihistamines and drugs can help to break that vicious cycle.

**Caller (David):** You've said before that nitric oxide is also a vicious loop.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Histamine turns on the production of nitric oxide, and nitric oxide signals a bunch of other inflammatory processes. The worst thing is that it interferes with oxygen energy production.

**Caller (David):** So the mucus flowing is probably a good thing, but it may be part of that vicious cycle we want to stop.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mucus itself is fine and helpful, but you wouldn't have to produce it if you didn't have the inflammation.

## Caller: Sleep-Onset Symptoms and Eggs

**Caller (Christina):** I've been experiencing terrible allergies for the past month, and symptoms flare up right when I go to sleep. Why does that happen, and what do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is when the parasympathetic system kicks in and lowers your blood sugar. That combination turns on histamine release and inflammation. I had that pattern of sleep-onset asthma. I found that Jimson weed or atropine—the belladonna type chemical—breaks the muscarinic part of the parasympathetic reaction. I found that would keep me from going into that very low blood sugar state. However, relying on anticholinergics tends to dry your mouth and cause tooth decay. It is an emergency treatment.

The real solution is to adjust your thyroid and progesterone. Progesterone has a broad variety of antihistamine effects. Estrogen turns on both the multiplication of mast cells and their tendency to release histamine and serotonin. Getting your thyroid to a good level will reduce estrogen and increase progesterone. Aspirin is another antihistamine that works indirectly by reducing prostaglandin and nitric oxide production.

**Andrew Murray:** You could take three 325mg tablets of aspirin a day, in conjunction with Vitamin K. One drop of Vitamin K per tablet is adequate to offset any potential blood thinning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Sometimes just taking 300-500mg before bedtime has time to get absorbed before you fall asleep.

**Caller (Christina):** My naturopath said I was getting eczema from eating eggs. I know you say eggs are good, but the eczema comes back when I eat them, and I get a headache.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've had that reaction many times to liver, which is another good food. When you tend to have high histamine or parasympathetic dominance, a dose of very high-quality protein powerfully stimulates insulin production and drops your blood sugar. It's the same reaction that happens when you go to sleep. I learned to never eat more than one egg per 10-ounce glass of sweet orange juice to balance the protein.

## Caller: Anaphylactic Shock and Sugar

**Caller (Coleman):** I used to carry Sudafed in my truck for rattlesnakes, understanding it was a possible use on the way to getting help. Is sugar also something that could help in that regard?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having a Coca-Cola or Pepsi would work. Most people I know have had Coca-Cola work. A 12-ounce glass contains about eight teaspoons of glucose sugar. I think it's mostly the sugar, but the caffeine contributes to keeping your blood sugar up. Ephedra is more powerful than caffeine but works in the same direction.

**Andrew Murray:** Ephedra used to be an herb par excellence for asthma before it was withdrawn. Was it the sympathetic drive or antihistamine quality responsible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they are all the same thing. Pharmacologists like to talk about specific receptors, but there is an extreme overlap. Benzedrine, amphetamine, ephedra, dopamine, adrenaline, diphenhydramine, cyproheptadine—all of these have a good antihistamine, pro-blood sugar, pro-respiratory effect.

**Andrew Murray:** Are there any sympathetic stimulants that don't have such a stimulant effect on blood pressure but still have an antihistamine effect?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The currently popular alternative that is legal is produced in the brain, a close relative of dopamine and adrenaline called phenethylamine (PEA). But people are talking about 500 to 1,500 milligram doses, which I think are crazy. A helpful dose would be maybe 5 or 10 milligrams.

## Atopic Dermatitis

**Andrew Murray:** I read an article stating that 95% of people with chronic atopic dermatitis get colonized with *Staphylococcus aureus*. Do you think atopic dermatitis can be treated through the gut?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the gut and the skin have some antigens and enzymes that are so closely connected that when one is inflamed, the other gets inflamed. Thyroid and Vitamin D are the most common solutions to hypersensitivity of the gut and skin.

## Caller: Hypnic Headaches

**Caller (Jana):** I wake up every night with a hypnic headache at 1:00, 3:00, or 4:00 AM. Coffee is about the only thing that relieves it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is exactly the same thing. The parasympathetic system is overactive, pushes the blood sugar down, and then inflammatory things get loose in the intestine and blood vessels. I've used sugar and milk as a compact way to interrupt the night. If you wake up, have half a glass of milk with a heaping tablespoon of sugar. It will usually help you get through the rest of the night.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you see low thyroid as a mechanism here?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low thyroid function develops because of accumulating PUFA in the system. When your thyroid is low, prostaglandins are let loose and activate histamine release. Increasing your thyroid can stabilize your tissues so they don't release so much unsaturated fat during the night.

**Caller (Jana):** Is the coffee enema the same effect as drinking coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think drinking coffee with cream is better because you absorb it slowly and steadily, especially if it's with food like a raw carrot. A coffee enema gives you a very sharp increase that can be stressful.

## Herbal Remedies and Supplements

**Andrew Murray:** How many traditional herbs used for allergies might actually have a gut-related anti-inflammatory effect? For example, turmeric.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect they are. The famous soothing teas such as chamomile are working largely on the intestine. Cooked mushrooms are definitely acting on the intestine primarily.

**Andrew Murray:** Have you heard of cromolyn sodium? It comes from *Ammi visnaga*.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never used them, but I know of them.

**Andrew Murray:** What about methylxanthines like theophylline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Caffeine is my favorite of the category. There is one used medically that has a few carbons added to make it more stable intracellularly—a medically approved version of caffeine.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned Datura as a good anticholinergic. Can that be tolerated long-term?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The dry mouth is the only serious side effect. I've known people who loved it so much they ruined their teeth because of the absence of saliva flow during the night. It's very good for night seizures or asthma, but bad to do chronically. You can do the same thing safely with the oily vitamins—Vitamin E, D, and K. Vitamin B6 and thiamine are important for stabilizing mast cells and blood sugar. Magnesium is essential and works with thyroid.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** So we come back to adequate sugars, adequate thyroid hormone, avoidance of polyunsaturates, and a clean diet to prevent constipation and endotoxin reabsorption.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And cascara is another one. The drug companies seem to be getting interested in it as a cancer treatment and for dementia and heart disease. It has a tremendous range of protective effects besides protecting the intestine.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat. For those listening, Dr. Peat's website is www.raypeat.com. He has many fully referenced scientific articles there. We will talk to you next month. Good night.
