## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. Sarah is away looking after our baby girl, so I will be hosting solo. We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

Tonight we are continuing our discussion on heart hormones and hopefully getting into Dr. Peat's recent work on cataracts, aging, degeneration, and swelling. The number to call is 923-3911 or 1-800-KMUD-RAD. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Estrogen, Edema, and Environmental Toxins

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to carry on from the last couple of months regarding the subject of edema and wetness of the tissue. You have mentioned that tumors are generally solid but actually have a higher than average water content. This links to eye changes, specifically age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, which also have high water concentrations.

We have discussed estrogen's devastating effects many times. The only real function for estrogen is for the implantation of a fertilized ovum. Outside of that, it wreaks havoc in the female body and is a very negative, inflammatory molecule. I wanted to cover the danger of environmental estrogens found in compounds like BPA and plastics. What do you know about their negative impact?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the organism is exposed at a very early stage, such as during gestation or infancy, the signals for development are changed, especially in the reproductive system. Besides changing the individual by giving it false signals, the DNA is altered slightly by attaching methyl groups to it. This means the ability to express enzymes for the rest of its life will be influenced. Typically, these changes will last for three or four generations even without further exposure. The changes that happen to one individual can be passed on, altering fertility until it can tend to cause the species to disappear.

**Andrew Murray:** What is your opinion on the amount of pollution we are exposed to from these estrogen-like substances?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the Columbia River and the ocean off the mouth of the Columbia, they are seeing fish and mammals that are sexually malformed and developing tumors. In Florida, there have been stories about swamp animals becoming sterile or changing genders. The news regarding human health isn't being honestly reported. Because of the influence of the estrogen industry, there is a reluctance to admit that estrogen has these toxic effects, even though it has been known for 100 years. They blame any effects they see on diet or smoking rather than the root cause.

## Estrogen and Heart Failure

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the association of heart failure and cardiac death, what have you found regarding estrogen's effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Despite 40 years of propaganda trying to sell estrogen to men to prevent heart attacks, they found that men died faster when they took estrogen. The Women's Health Initiative set that back by showing that estrogen replacement therapy for menopause increased the number of heart attacks, cancer, and dementia.

Just recently, an article appeared from Yale Medical School claiming that tens of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily by refusing to take their estrogen treatment. It reminds me of a debate 40 years ago where Barbara Seaman debated a Yale professor and made him look like an ignoramus because she knew the facts. I suspect Yale is now having its revenge.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned that varicose veins were a visible sign of a lowered ratio of progesterone to estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen is a cell excitant. In the process of stimulating activity, it makes the cell retain water. The individual cell stays excited too long, admits water, and fails to relax to expel that water. Under the influence of too much unopposed estrogen, cells become waterlogged and lose the ability to contract fully.

In a vein wall, this means it cannot maintain its tone. The same thing happens in nerves and heart muscle. Albert Szent-Györgyi demonstrated over 50 years ago that under the influence of progesterone, if you stimulate the heart at an increasing frequency, each stroke becomes stronger. But if it is dominated by estrogen, the heart responds to fast stimulation with weak little contractions. That is basically how a failing heart behaves.

## Testosterone and Muscle

**Andrew Murray:** Progesterone and testosterone oppose the action of estrogen. Let's talk about testosterone. You have advocated for non-stressful, weight-bearing exercise rather than aerobic workouts. You’ve said this increases the ability to produce muscle, which helps maintain stable weight and metabolism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Muscle also metabolizes steroid hormones. With exercise, it can actually secrete testosterone. However, in resting or stressed muscle, without adequate stimulation from good food and thyroid, muscles produce a lot of estrogen. In one study, they found that a monkey's arm was producing as much estrogen as its ovary. Any stressed tissue is going to tend to produce estrogen, but well-exercised, strong muscle begins producing testosterone and stops producing estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** So muscles in their own right can secrete testosterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The skin is also known to produce testosterone among other steroid hormones. It might be the body's biggest endocrine synthetic factory.

## Cholesterol and Statins

**Andrew Murray:** I know you have mentioned a study that associated increased cholesterol with an improved outcome from heart failure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That can be generalized to other muscles. Everyone is hearing the bad news about anti-cholesterol drugs causing muscle breakdown. Sometimes the muscle breaks down so completely that the leaking proteins poison the kidneys. Cholesterol is a stabilizing factor for skeletal muscles. If you stop cholesterol synthesis, the muscles are very susceptible to damage. Those same processes occur simultaneously in the heart muscle.

## Hypoxia, Sugar, and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** You have mentioned a link between hypoxia (oxygen deficit) and cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Research lately focuses on the "hypoxia inducible factor" (HIF). It turns out this protein can be induced by cutting off the glucose supply, so it really should be called the energy deprivation protein. This turns on all the bad processes: carbon monoxide production, nitric oxide synthase, lactic acid production, and inflammation. Lactic acid, in turn, activates the HIF.

**Andrew Murray:** You have always promoted a carbon dioxide-rich environment as beneficial. Is there anything negative about hypoxia itself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you think of hypoxia as turning on lactic acid, which then turns on inflammatory signals, you see that carbon dioxide turns off the production of lactic acid. Simply the ability to turn off lactic acid production is one of the basic protective features of carbon dioxide.

## Water in Tissues and Eye Health

**Andrew Murray:** Your research shows that the "wetness" in the eye associated with cataracts is the same kind of wetness found in tumors, heart failure, and brain disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Despite the fact that a failing heart becomes hardened or calcified, and tumors are stiffer than healthy tissue, these degenerative tissues actually contain more water. If you dry a piece of the organ, it loses much more weight than a healthy organ would.

Besides the percentage of water, the water changes state and becomes relatively more like free "bulk" water. In a healthy cell, the water functions somewhat as an antifreeze, bound to the cell so it isn't free to move out or be frozen. If you freeze a lens that has cataracts, it will crystallize easier than a healthy lens. This can be seen in an MRI machine; you can clearly see the difference between water bound firmly to the cell and excess, useless water plugging up cell function.

## Caller: Water Structure and Diet

**Caller (David):** When we have tissues experiencing edema, is that water considered not to be structured at its optimum? Also, do we produce our own water, and is the water in raw milk or orange juice considered optimum structured water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It doesn't make much difference whether you drink water that has been boiled or frozen; what matters is the state of the water *inside* the cell. That is governed by the energy of metabolism and the ratio of carbon dioxide to lactic acid.

In the eye, the main protein is called crystallin. It is very well ordered with reference to the structure of water and visible light. It binds water firmly—about twice as much as other proteins—so it doesn't interfere with light passing through. When energy processes fail due to estrogen, PUFA, or toxins, the water gets out of control and becomes ordinary bulk water. This interferes with light and lets junk accumulate, such as acrolein from broken-down polyunsaturated fats.

Regarding food, water that has been filtered through an orange tree or a cow is very purified compared to city plumbing. We also make metabolic water when we eat carbohydrates; some of the oxygen we use to produce energy becomes water.

## Caller: Menopause and Black Cohosh

**Sue (Producer):** A caller wants to know if Black Cohosh is effective for menopause, or what the best herbs would be.

**Andrew Murray:** I view Black Cohosh with caution as some research suggests it is an estrogen stimulant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard ideas that it was an anti-prolactin factor, but I don't know the current status. Usually, thyroid and cholesterol tend to rise at menopause. If thyroid is adequate, that will keep turning the cholesterol into pregnenolone and progesterone to protect against estrogen.

## Caller: Metoprolol and Cholesterol

**Caller (Laytonville):** I take Metoprolol and Isosorbide for my heart. I've had seven heart attacks. Is taking this much Metoprolol for cholesterol something I should be concerned about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only safe way I know to lower cholesterol chronically is by increasing thyroid function. In 1936, it was demonstrated that if you remove a thyroid gland, cholesterol goes up; if you give a thyroid supplement, cholesterol falls as oxygen consumption increases.

Doctors prefer to prescribe drugs, but cholesterol is normally destined to turn into DHEA, progesterone, and testosterone. If you push down the availability of cholesterol by any mechanism, you deprive the body of those steroids.

## Thyroid Supplements: T3 vs. T4

**Sue (Producer):** Does it matter if a thyroid supplement is T4 or T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The study that led to the substitution of thyroxine (T4) for the natural combination was a test on male medical students in their early 20s. Being male, they didn't have the thyroid problems women typically have. Estrogen interferes with the gland's secretion of both T4 and T3, but it especially interferes with the liver's ability to convert thyroxine to the active hormone T3. Many women actually get worse symptoms when they take thyroxine because it suppresses the little bit of T3 their gland is producing, yet doesn't add to the amount of T3 that should be produced by the liver.

## Cannabis and Estrogen

**Sue (Producer):** What are the effects of cannabinoids on cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People are still exploring that. Some suspect it might slow cancer growth, others worry it might make it worse. Mostly it is used to prevent stress symptoms.

**Andrew Murray:** Hops are in the same family (Cannabaceae) and are pro-estrogenic. Do you view cannabis compounds as pro-estrogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely. Hops is a very powerful estrogen. Almost every plant has some estrogenic material as a defense mechanism. Known effects of heavy marijuana smoking are definitely estrogenic, but some of that could just be that any kind of smoke is estrogenic.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there any parallel with the carbon monoxide from smoke?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carbon monoxide can accumulate and have chronic harmful effects, but the real danger of smoke is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are inflammatory, estrogenic, and carcinogenic.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We will carry this subject on next month. Dr. Raymond Peat's website is www.raypeat.com, which contains over 50 scientifically referenced articles. I'm glad current scientific literature is finally vindicating what he has been saying for 30 years. Thank you for joining us.
