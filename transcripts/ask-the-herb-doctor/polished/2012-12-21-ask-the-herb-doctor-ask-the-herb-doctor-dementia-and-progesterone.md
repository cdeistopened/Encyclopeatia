## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. His latest research article is what we're going to be opening up in this month's show. His article is entitled "Demystifying Dementia: Protective Progesterone." I know he's a big fan of progesterone and the other anti-aging, anti-inflammatory related compounds. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. For those people who perhaps have never listened to the show before or maybe don't know you, would you please just give us a rundown of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From 1968 to 1972, I studied biology at the University of Oregon for a PhD and worked on aging of the reproductive system and physiology more generally. One of the things I noticed during working on my thesis relates to what we were talking about last month regarding the relation of hormones to electromagnetic fields and dementia.

I had been interested in radiation for a long time before I went to the University of Oregon and was aware of some of the biological interactions. But working on my thesis, I noticed that the effects of estrogen on biochemistry are in many ways exactly the same as those of ionizing radiation, and also parallel the effects of too much polyunsaturated fat in the diet or a deficiency of vitamin E. That synergy between estrogen, radiation, and fatty acids is behind this month's newsletter.

## Metabolic Energy and Stress

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to talk a little bit more about energy. If there's something we want to get across, it is the need for metabolic energy in our bodies. Every organism ultimately uses energy to convert chemicals into other chemicals, and all the cellular processes require a currency of some kind of energy. Ultimately, ours is oxidatively burning glucose. That's the best way of doing it, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Under stress, we can force our physiology over to burning fat instead of glucose. That causes several changes. It produces less carbon dioxide and is likely to produce a lot of breakdown products that can cause inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** And the carbon dioxide is useful. I think most people think of oxygen as being life-giving, but ultimately the oxygen is not particularly good for you, is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Most people have heard about the glycated proteins that people get in diabetes or aging—they call them AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products). Those stick to certain parts of protein molecules. It happens that carbon dioxide also has a spontaneous ability to attach to those same groups. If carbon dioxide is abundant, you can't get glycation because carbon dioxide is protecting that.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the higher carbon dioxide in the blood will help you utilize your oxygen better. Obviously, if you have too high of a level, carbon dioxide will probably cause problems, but within normal levels, it helps.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it delivers oxygen to the cell. For example, in the brain, in proportion to how much glucose you're oxidizing and how much carbon dioxide you're producing, it not only releases the oxygen from the hemoglobin so it can get into the cell, but it relaxes the blood vessels so that more blood brings oxygen. That's a general feature of carbon dioxide; it tends to relax things.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when our metabolism is working healthily, we will be burning sugar for fuel and not fat. Under stressful situations, we burn fat. If that fat is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) from nut and seed oils, then it becomes quite a stress on the system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And it happens that starvation, radiation, or estrogen will all shift our oxidation from sugar to fat.

**Andrew Murray:** Which is why fasting is not a good thing to do, is it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the special problems of fasting, if you've been eating polyunsaturated fats in the past, is that it gives you a pure diet of polyunsaturated fat with a terrific amount of oxidation byproducts when you go into a starvation state. They specifically spoil the ability of the enzymes to produce energy from anything, especially from sugar. The failure to produce energy is almost exactly the definition of stress. Anything that makes you lack energy is stress. It turns on the whole system of responses to stress.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Doesn't the body go into stress after eight hours of not eating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you've got a tremendously efficient liver, some people can go much longer than that. But as your liver gets less efficient, many people can only go an hour or even less without suffering the symptoms of starvation. Some people wake up every one or two hours during the night with nightmares or heart pounding, which happens when the liver runs out of its sugar supply.

## Alzheimer's, Amyloid, and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** Would you explain why this energy failure is in part responsible for Alzheimer's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The features that people consider to define Alzheimer's in the last 10 or 20 years have been the amyloid plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles. It happens that the folding of these proteins that form amyloid fibrils is intensified by free fatty acids if they're polyunsaturated.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And those are released into the bloodstream when your liver runs out of sugar, basically, or you're starving.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. So chronic starvation, chronic exposure to polyunsaturated free fatty acids, or chronic exposure to stress is a major factor in creating the amyloid. The amyloid has a chain reaction effect, creating the tangles, the phosphorylation of Tau protein, and the whole structural change typical of the Alzheimer's brain.

But any injury to any tissue, anywhere in the body, happens to activate the enzyme which creates estrogen. It's like when you injure a tree, it causes sprouting by turning on hormones in response to the injury. That's how estrogen works. Many enzymes get turned on, but especially aromatase, which is the basic former of estrogen itself. So in stress or any injury, aromatase appears and begins making estrogen right inside the tissue. And that happens in the Alzheimer's brain.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned also that the mitochondria—the factories of energy production within the cell—are also damaged by estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Estrogen damages them in at least six or eight different ways. It shifts from the ability to oxidize glucose and impairs the very enzyme that uses oxygen in several different places in the mitochondria. Besides poisoning the energy, it also blocks the ability to turn cholesterol into steroid hormones.

The brain is one of our biggest steroid-forming glands in the body. Its concentration of steroids—progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone—is about 10 times higher than in the bloodstream. The production of these neurosteroids is one of the major uses of oxygen. Testosterone is produced in the brain as well as absorbed from the blood. When the brain is injured, besides not making these hormones as effectively as it should because of the damage to mitochondria, the aromatase enzyme begins turning testosterone into estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So basically, we can look at estrogen as a very big player in mediating inflammation. Estrogen would be the opposite of what testosterone and progesterone do in the healthy brain.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in many ways—probably dozens of different ways.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I don't think people consider estrogen to be such an inflammatory mediator. I think we consider estrogen to just be a normal hormone like progesterone and testosterone. But actually, they're contradicting each other constantly in male and female bodies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's because the estrogen industry has done such a good advertising job. It's now generally and widely accepted that the Alzheimer's brain is inflamed, but they don't like to talk about the connection between inflammation and high estrogen production in the brain and the loss of progesterone and testosterone.

## Prevention and Acrolein

**Andrew Murray:** Given that the amyloid and the neurofibrillary tangles are diagnostic in the brain, what are the best things to do in terms of energy production or protection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's hard to say what's most important because there are so many things working together. But keeping your exposure to the polyunsaturated fats as low as possible, keeping the endotoxin exposure low, and avoiding excess iron retention. All of the inflammatory things following from estrogen and serotonin overexposure cause the release of iron from the breakdown of the hemoglobin molecule. The iron is a catalyst to the lipid peroxidation that is exaggeratedly high in demented brains.

**Andrew Murray:** That brings me to lipid peroxidation byproducts. You mentioned a compound called acrolein as being 10 to 100 times more potent than some of the other lipid byproducts from fish oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a very tiny fragment that comes mainly from the Omega-3 fatty acids. I think because it's so small and chemically active, it has a greater effect by many times than the longer chain aldehydes. The fact that it comes from the oils that are being proposed as cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease—fish oil supplements and other Omega-3 fats—are the main sources of acrolein.

## Testosterone and Radiation

**Andrew Murray:** I know you said also that testosterone opposes the effects of estrogen and cortisol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. One of the ways testosterone works is to lower the luteinizing hormone (LH). People are now thinking that this gonadotropin pituitary hormone itself has a big role in forming Alzheimer's disease. For example, they've created transgenic mice that can't produce any of the LH pituitary hormone. When they are crossed with a strain that is bred to produce dementia, if they don't have the luteinizing hormone, they don't get demented.

Other mice are similarly altered genetically so that they have no aromatase enzyme and can't produce estrogen. When they're crossed with a demented strain, they can age normally without dementia, and they happen to have twice as much testosterone in their brain as the normal mice that can produce aromatase. So the estrogen is being produced at the expense of the testosterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And you were telling us that even though they stopped the atomic bomb testing in 1962 or 1963, and it only peaked around 1965, all the accumulation of the radioactive isotopes in our environment caused a large increase in Alzheimer's disease in 1980. It seemed to take 15 years.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably other things were happening at the same time. The increasing consumption of polyunsaturated fats has continued through this same period. The consumption of milk decreased during this time, and there have been several studies that showed that milk drinkers have less Alzheimer's disease. So the declining milk happens to coincide with increasing polyunsaturated fats and the previous exposure to large amounts of radioactive isotopes.

## Thyroid and Red Light Therapy

**Andrew Murray:** You've been a great proponent of thyroid hormone as well as progesterone. The bottom line with thyroid hormone is that it enables metabolism to be corrected by producing energy more effectively.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It increases the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, which is the one that is very sensitive to stress, estrogen, carbon monoxide, and basically all of the toxins. Thyroid causes the genes to be expressed and causes the copper to be absorbed that the enzyme uses as a cofactor.

Light is another major factor. With the stress of metabolism, the copper can get detached from the enzyme. Exposure to ordinary visible light—the red, long waves of light that will pass right into your brain—happens to lift the copper atom just enough to restore its position in the cytochrome enzyme. The copper is reactivated by the red light. Just in the last year, a group in the US did memory studies and showed that just shining some red light on the head improves memory.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And right now we're experiencing the lowest light of the entire year.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think everyone is a little demented in the winter.

## Caller Questions: Light Exposure

**Caller 1:** I have three related questions regarding light. How many hours a day do you consider it healthy to expose oneself to natural daylight? During what hours? And do you have cautionary words for those of us who still have high polyunsaturated fatty acid stores in our tissue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ultraviolet damages cells primarily by interacting with polyunsaturated fats. The worst damage is done by the oxidation of unsaturated fats. Aspirin is very protective against sunburn. Progesterone and other things that stop the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats will protect to a great extent against ultraviolet and sunburn or against ionizing radiation. But you don't want to count on taking aspirin and progesterone; it's better to avoid the radiation itself.

The exposure to red light, if it comes within an hour of the ionizing or ultraviolet exposure, does something very similar to repairing the energy of mitochondria. It stops the electronic excitation that continues causing chain reactions of oxidation of the polyunsaturated fats. They've given experimental animals killing doses of gamma rays, but if they shine very bright red light on them in the first hour, they aren't killed.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's quite incredible. So what would you recommend as a healthy level at this dark time of the year?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's best to keep as much incandescent, long-wave light on your skin as possible for as many hours of the day as possible. Just turn it off for eight or nine hours while you're asleep. Avoid the too-intense light during the middle of the day in summer because the circulating oxidative products of the polyunsaturated fats poison your whole body.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So depending on the time of year, before 10:00 or 11:00 AM and after 2:00 or 3:00 PM?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and just enough to get your vitamin D requirement, but you don't want to get sunburned.

**Andrew Murray:** You've recommended 250-watt heat lamps as a good source of red light in the past.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Even two or three of those this time of year, right up until almost bedtime. It's good to have 300 or 500 watts shining pretty much at you.

## Caller Questions: Intelligence and Learning

**Caller 2 (Sandy):** I've been looking into accelerated learning and smart drugs. I know you mentioned taking Vitamin B1 before a test. I wanted to ask about ways of increasing intelligence and maximizing learning.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The most intense effect you can get is from the right combination of thyroid (T3) and a big dose of Vitamin B1, if the rest of your nutrition is good. I've told several people to try that over the years, and no one has scored under 800 on the Graduate Record Exam when they did that. Taking about 100 milligrams at the start lets you have access to just about everything you've ever known or thought.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** 100 milligrams of B1?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. You have to back up your physiology. The thyroid and B1 can't do it all by themselves.

## EMFs and Sewing Machines

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, going back to non-ionizing radiation, you said there was a study done on sewing machine workers and how they had a three times risk of dementia or Alzheimer's because they were exposed to an electromagnetic field from the motor.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think that was people who were working eight or ten hours a day for a long time, like in a sweatshop situation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So even something people think is harmless, like a motor, can cause an imbalance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And very small fields have been used therapeutically. Michael Persinger has done some very good neurological studies, and he has a video on YouTube explaining some of the energy levels involved in nerve interactions with electromagnetic fields.

## Caller Questions: Polyunsaturated Oils

**Michael (Engineer):** A caller heard you mention that liquid oils—nut and seed oils—are bad. Could you expound on that?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), also known as Omega-3 and Omega-6 oils, are found in all nuts and seeds. Coconut oil is a very saturated fat, so it does not contain these. We're talking about hemp seed, cottonseed, corn, safflower, canola, sunflower, sesame, peanut, and brazil nut. Olive oil is not considered a PUFA because it only has about 10% PUFA and the other 90% is monounsaturated.

**Michael (Engineer):** What about the high oleic safflower and sunflower?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was working in the hamster lab at the university, I bought a bottle of corn oil, put a rubber tube in the top with a stopper, and put the other end in a bottle of water. I was doing respiration experiments at the time on tissue with a Warburg apparatus. As the tissue respired, it would suck water up the tube. This bottle of corn oil was respiring about as fast as my tissues, sucking water up as it oxidized that quickly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they're very prone to oxidation and going rancid. Even if they are not rancid before you eat them, they will go rancid inside your body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fish oil is much more unstable oxidatively than even ordinary corn oil.

## Caller Questions: Macadamia Nuts and Computers

**Caller 4:** What about macadamia nut oil?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's higher in the monounsaturates—higher in oleic acid—than the other nut and seed oils. That is the one nut I will eat occasionally.

**Caller 4:** What happens with computer screens? We're talking about laptops.

**Andrew Murray:** The monitors most people use these days are flat screens, not the old cathode ray tubes (CRTs) which were very strong emitters.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think you should keep a laptop on your lap.

**Caller 4:** My wife is on one eight hours a day and gets dizzy and forgetful. Is there a detox for computer users?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Don't keep it on your lap. Get a detachable keyboard so you're not putting a motor or battery that's emitting electromagnetic fields on your body.

**Andrew Murray:** A walk in nature.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** A walk on the beach, so you're next to the breaking waves.

## Caller Questions: Earthing

**Caller 5 (David):** Have you heard of earthing technology? I have a mat that I use. Supposedly the ground frequency of the earth overwhelms electromagnetic waves.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The particular thought they have is that it removes an excess of electrons from the body, but actually, the earth is also a source of electrons. I'm fairly sure that there is benefit from having some kind of more or less direct contact with the earth. I'm not sure the argument in that book is exactly right, but I think the point is good. One thing it does is prevent the buildup of fields. Grounding everything in the house is probably a good idea, but staying away from the machine as far as possible is the best thing.

## Caller Questions: Cod Liver Oil and Coconut Oil

**Caller 6:** I attended a Weston A. Price Foundation conference. They recommended fermented cod liver oil plus butter oil. There was also evidence given about how coconut oil prevents and reverses Alzheimer's.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The butter is good. I think it's better to eat the whole liver rather than just the oil because there is a lot of polyunsaturated fat in the oil.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You'll get the same vitamins in the actual liver rather than in the oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And many more vitamins besides. Vitamin K is in the liver, but not in the oil.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about the Weston A. Price protocol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's better than most things going around.

## Caller Questions: Cannabis Juice and Heating Pads

**Caller 7:** I recovered from dementia by juicing vegetative cannabis leaves. Do you know anything about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've heard of using the various forms of the cannabis chemicals, but not the leaves.

Earlier we were talking about avoiding unsaturated fats. The saturated fats help to protect you against even the stored unsaturated fats in your tissues. That's one of the things coconut oil is doing. Since the unsaturated fats are poisoning your energy-producing system and blocking thyroid action, usually you can notice your metabolic rate speed up when you take a tablespoon of coconut oil. That only lasts for an hour or so. So if you do it with each meal, you're getting, in effect, thyroid activation which restores your energy production. Coconut oil, sugar, and thyroid help to offset the polyunsaturated fats.

**Caller 8:** My good friend lays on a heating pad.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's putting out 60-cycle fields, very strong and close to your body. So it's better to use your heating pad on the bed before you get in, or your electric blanket the same. Turn it off when you get in bed.

**Michael (Engineer):** A caller wanted to know about green tea oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know anything about it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I didn't know that tea had enough fat in it to make an oil.

## Endotoxin, Autism, and Fruit

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, you talked about endotoxin and how that can increase dementia. Dr. Andrew Wakefield, when he was studying autistic children, noticed that when their diets were cleaned up or they took antibiotics or aspirin, they had a reduction in autistic symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's consistent with everything else that endotoxin does. It increases your serotonin exposure. Serotonin works to increase estrogen, free fatty acids, and so on, poisoning the mitochondria. High serotonin is characteristic of autism. Cleaning up the intestine has done a similar thing for autism. Anything that lowers the serotonin seems to help—thyroid, or drugs such as cyproheptadine.

I should mention that particles being increasingly used in food supplements, such as titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, have been put into animals' noses and they find that they go directly to the brain and cause inflammation. Similarly in the intestine, any particle that is ingested can get into the bloodstream and reach the brain.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And I know you're a big proponent of not eating grains and starchy root vegetables and instead eating fruit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Part of that is because the particles of starch themselves can get into every compartment of the body, including the brain. Another diet feature that helps with all of the brain problems is fruit juice. Orange juice and guava, for example, are very high in substances that knock out the estrogen-producing enzyme—they're aromatase inhibitors. These are apigenin, naringenin, and hesperidin. Soybeans happen to have a substance that does exactly the opposite called genistein.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So for Christmas, avoid soy and eat oranges instead.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us and sharing. We really do appreciate you giving your time. For listeners who have joined the show, please visit www.raypeat.com. Everything he has is fully referenced scientific journal quality articles.
