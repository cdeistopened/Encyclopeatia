## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who just joined us or have never heard the show before, it runs every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM. As has become customary, Dr. Raymond Peat is our guest joining us to share his knowledge. Last month in October, we opened a discussion concerning metabolic defects in cancer and alternative strategies. Dr. Peat has been researching and working in alternative approaches to physiology for 35 to 40 years. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for giving your time again. Would you let people know a bit about your academic research background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 60s, I was studying various subjects in the humanities, and I decided to go into biology to study the brain. When I got to graduate school in 1968, my interest went to aging and its influence on the metabolism of the reproductive process—how reproduction influences the general process of aging. Since then, I've been following up on the same general topics: aging, stress, sickness, and especially how reproductive hormones can accelerate or retard the process of aging.

## Cancer Metabolism and Fats

**Andrew Murray:** Last month we covered cellular mitochondrial activity and how that produces energy. We discussed the myth of sugar being cancer-promoting, which is rife in the mainstream. You’ve dispelled that myth. We also discussed neuroendocrine dysregulation, how estrogen drives cancers, and how chronic stress produces cortisol which weakens the immune system.

I have some abstracts here regarding lipid peroxidation. We have discussed how polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) cause destruction and inflammation. These abstracts suggest that lipid oxidation promotes cancer. The rationale of people using Omega-3s, Omega-6s, and fish oils as being "healthy" is absolutely not what you want to be doing if you have a cancer diagnosis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of the abstracts you're referring to mentioned that on a high fish oil diet, the metastasis was about 1,000 times worse than on a low-fat diet or a fat-deficient diet. It is a huge difference from supplementing fish oil versus not having fat. We can make all of the unsaturated and saturated fats that we need from carbohydrates, so we don't really need any fats in the diet except for the pleasant taste and helping to absorb nutrients. These abstracts show the tremendous pro-metastatic effect of the fish oil fats.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw other references regarding liver metastases. Obviously, the liver is a major organ that blood flows through, and vascular-borne cancers often settle there. These articles stated that Omega-3s, in particular, promoted cancer metastasis to the liver.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** This lipid peroxidation—or rancid fat—applies not only to fish oils but also to vegetable seed oils like canola and soy, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The more highly unsaturated they are, the quicker they break down. Some of the oxidative breakdown is almost immediate. As soon as it gets absorbed from your intestine and shows up in your bloodstream, you can find the highly oxidized breakdown fragments of the polyunsaturated fats.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did I hear you correctly stating that metastasis is 1,000 times worse in a fatty diet versus a non-fat diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of these studies found that the number and quantity of identifiable metastatic cancer was, in these cases, 1,000 times higher.

## The Ketogenic Diet and The Randle Cycle

**Andrew Murray:** This would suggest that for people talking about ketogenic diets, this is the last thing you want to be doing, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the process of getting the ketogenic effect, it is basically starvation and stress that turns on the so-called ketone production. One of the major "ketone bodies" is actually not a ketone, but an alcohol. In the hydroxyl state formed during the ketogenic diet, this becomes a reductant having an effect similar to lactic acid, which is a trigger to shift oxidation towards the fermentation metabolism typical of cancer.

Once anything interferes with your ability to oxidize glucose fully, that liberates any stored fatty acids you have in your tissues. In the ketogenic state, you are releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream. All of the liberated free fatty acids that have been studied promote metastasis.

Many years ago, a researcher named Randle noticed that if you increase the fat in your diet and it turns into free fatty acids, those fatty acids block the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, which lets us oxidize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This is the Randle Cycle. Once you get ketogenic from starvation, you are poisoning your ability to fully oxidize glucose. That leaves you producing lactic acid. When pyruvate dehydrogenase is poisoned—especially by free fatty acids—you shift over to the cancer metabolism. This creates inflammation and brings up cortisol, which breaks down proteins to make more glucose or amino acids to feed the cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would that apply to saturated fat, but to a lesser extent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In some cases, certain saturated fats don't do that at all. But on average, the Randle effect works as soon as our glucose oxidation is interfered with by rising free fatty acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So generally, when you consult with people that might have cancer, would you recommend a very low-fat diet and a very high sucrose and fructose diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, carbohydrates in general, especially sucrose. I mentioned the "Grape Diet" last month. It was famous in the 40s and 50s. It was a very high glucose and sucrose diet combined with a very high intake of anti-inflammatory flavonoids. Those are two very important anti-cancer agents: the anti-inflammatory component found in fruits and vegetables, and an abundance of sucrose so that you don't resort to any tendency to liberate fatty acids.

## The Interstitium and Lymphatics

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about the "new organ" that science recently uncovered called the interstitium. They found that what they thought were flattened collagen bundles were actually structural cavities filled with fluid. This ground substance is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells. In herbal medicine, *Phytolacca* (poke root) has been traditionally used for breast cancer and lymphatic cancers. What do you understand about the interstitium and this ground substance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Structures have been identified within this previously thought-to-be amorphous extravascular system. A Korean researcher named Bonghan Kim called it the "third circulatory system" in the 1960s. What are now known as exosomes—small vesicles secreted by cells—are transported outside the blood vessels. Many of them flow through apparent channels in the extracellular material. They seem to be almost specific for carrying microvesicles from a cell under stress to a cell in the bone marrow, for example, that can produce repair factors.

## Listener Questions: Flax, Avocados, and Frankincense

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller who wants to know what you think of flax oil and avocados.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avocados are a good, pleasant, nutritious food, but you don't want to eat very large quantities regularly because there is some polyunsaturated fat in them. Flax oil is very highly polyunsaturated. Flax *meal* has a bulk laxative action which can be protective against cancer, but you don't want to build up a reserve of the polyunsaturated fats found in the oil.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Caller:** I have a miraculous story. I developed a chest cancer—it felt like a needle inside my chest. I applied a product called frankincense liberally to my chest, and four hours later the pain stopped. It hasn't returned in 10 years. Later, my sister was diagnosed with cancer and had a cyst. She used frankincense topically and took zeolite internally to remove heavy metals. Three months later, the cyst fell off. What do you think of those things?

**Andrew Murray:** Frankincense is *Boswellia sacra*. It is one of many herbs used for skin cancers. Dr. Peat, do you know much about zeolite?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I didn't hear all of that, but frankincense and myrrh contain a variety of triterpenes that are structured similarly to steroids. They haven't actually been studied enough to define exactly how their anti-cancer effect works.

## Connective Tissue Health

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the herbal perspective of improving the connective tissue and the interstitium. Since cancer cells break down adjacent tissues to invade vasculature, is there value in agents like horsetail (silica) or *Phytolacca* to tone the tissues? I know you mention calcium often regarding the extracellular matrix.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The role of calcium is very closely related to energy metabolism and inflammation. When you're deficient in energy, you activate many pro-inflammatory peptides. Getting the energy and essential nutrients provided is going to have an anti-inflammatory effect, which allows energy production to take effect and maintain structural integrity. The effect of adequate calcium in your diet is to oppose the excitatory effects of too much phosphate. So, calcium has an anti-inflammatory, pro-energy restoration effect that maintains the structural integrity of the interstitium.

## Bladder Cancer Treatments

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller from Garberville.

**Caller:** I had a low-grade bladder cancer that came back, and they just took it out. I was wondering if you had any recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several people have developed effective treatments by infusing a mixture of nutrients—vitamin A related compounds, proteolytic enzymes, and stabilizing anti-inflammatory agents such as lidocaine—into the bladder. You arrange the person's posture so that the mixture is in contact with the actual tumor itself. Several groups using similar mixtures have had a very high cure rate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You also mentioned anti-inflammatories. Would they have used something like aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always recommend aspirin for any cancer. It reduces inflammation, helps to restore the energy level, and has at least a dozen effects that help to control or eliminate cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I would like to put a warning out there: if people are choosing to use aspirin for treating their own cancers, especially more than a baby aspirin a day, you should really contact us. It is very important to take Vitamin K2 to prevent bleeding issues.

## Coagulopathy and Metastasis

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the coagulopathy (blood clotting) that happens with cancer—even if not stimulated by estrogen—what is the rationale for using things like aspirin, garlic, or ginkgo to improve blood flow?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The clotting system and platelets are central to the ability of metastatic cells to get across the blood vessel into the area it's going to colonize. Various things that decrease the stickiness and tendency to coagulate have been studied and shown to strongly discourage metastatic spread. Lidocaine, aspirin, and progesterone are three factors that have been demonstrated over and over to interfere with that metastatic stickiness. It makes the cells stay home and not hurt anything.

## Watchful Waiting vs. Aggressive Treatment

**Andrew Murray:** What about anti-angiogenic activity to manage cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were studies in the 40s and 50s showing that the longer people left their cancer untreated, the longer they lived. Several studies have looked at statistics showing that for some cancers, the more you treat, the higher the death rate is. That was first seen distinctly in prostate cancer in the early 90s. This led to the concept of "watchful waiting," figuring that if you don't use harmful treatments like high-dose estrogen, the normal aging process happens faster than the development of the cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What is that statistic you quote? That 99% of people over 50 have some form of abdominal cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an autopsy, you can find cancer essentially in 100% of people over 50 if you look for it. It's part of a natural healing process, and most people just coexist with many of these little cancers that aren't really hurting anything.

**Andrew Murray:** On a side note, I had a basal cell carcinoma on my nose confirmed by biopsy. I did what you suggested, and I don't have it anymore.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In your latest photograph, your nose looks fine. Before we end, I want to mention a book that might be the most important published in the last few years: Robert Kennedy Jr.'s *The Real Anthony Fauci*. It gives a background for the COVID-19 process and the history going back decades.
