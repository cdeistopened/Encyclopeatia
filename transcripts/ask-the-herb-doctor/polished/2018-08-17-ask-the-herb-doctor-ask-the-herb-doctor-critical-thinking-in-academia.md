## Introduction: Glyphosate and Celiac Disease

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month’s edition of *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. We invite callers to phone in with questions about the topic of the month, or if they have other questions related to Dr. Peat's expertise. I’d like to stay on topic because I know people really enjoy listening to Dr. Peat's wisdom.

My name is Andrew Murray. I graduated in herbal medicine in England in 1998 and have been living in California since 2000, running a business called Western Botanical Medicine. My training in naturopathic medicine brought me to a love and appreciation of natural healing.

That brings me to the opening subject of tonight's discourse: critical thinking in academia with relation to trials. I want to open by discussing the latest court ruling on glyphosate's cancer-causing effects that have finally been made public. Everyone knows Monsanto, the mega-corporation owning and patenting seeds. In the 90s, they genetically modified lucrative products like corn and soy to withstand heavy spraying of their herbicide, Roundup, of which the main ingredient is glyphosate.

I want to quote an interdisciplinary toxicological paper published in 2013 about celiac disease. It mentions that celiac and gluten intolerance are growing problems worldwide, especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, macrocytic anemia, and depression. It is a multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies, reproductive issues, and increased risk of thyroid disease, kidney failure, and cancer.

The authors propose that glyphosate is the most important causal factor in this epidemic. Fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems reminiscent of celiac disease. Celiac is associated with imbalances in gut bacteria that can be fully explained by the known effects of glyphosate on gut bacteria. Characteristics of celiac disease point to impairment in many cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved with detoxifying environmental toxins, activating vitamin D3, catabolizing vitamin A, and maintaining bile acid production and sulfate supplies to the gut. Glyphosate is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Deficiencies in iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper, and other rare metals associated with celiac disease can be attributed to glyphosate's strong ability to chelate these elements. Deficiencies in tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and selenomethionine associated with celiac disease match glyphosate's known depletion of these amino acids. Furthermore, celiac disease patients have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has also been implicated in glyphosate exposure.

A second source, analyzing samples from a 2017 prospective study at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, found that human exposure to glyphosate has increased approximately 500% since the introduction of genetically modified crops like Monsanto's "Roundup Ready" corn and soy.

The FDA only recently started testing for glyphosate—a chemical used for over 40 years—which is cause for suspicion. FDA chemist Narong Chamkasem found glyphosate levels in corn at 6.5 parts per million, while the legal limit is 5 parts per million. An illegal level would normally be reported to the EPA, but an FDA supervisor wrote that the corn was not considered an "official sample." Chamkasem also found glyphosate in honey and oatmeal products. The FDA temporarily suspended testing after those findings, and Chamkasem's lab was reassigned.

So, how does science become corrupt? And how can we protect ourselves from corrupt science? We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** For those who have not heard of your background, would you give people an update on your history?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My academic biology study was at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972, focusing on biology and biochemistry, especially reproductive physiology. Since then, I've continued to study, primarily with an interest in nerve biology, reproductive physiology, and especially aging and how it relates to energy production.

## Corruption in Science and Radiation Research

**Andrew Murray:** You have worked closely within university institutions and have firsthand knowledge of the chain of corruption. Would you describe how this begins at the academic level and travels through to the final product?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Long before I went to the university, I had been interested in many biological fields, especially radiation poisoning from sources like atomic bomb testing. As I got interested in the late 40s and 50s, reading what was available before the government and its Atomic Energy Commission began controlling publication, I thought that anyone working in biology or radiation physics who told the truth had a big campaign organized against them.

One of the first researchers who studied the harmful effects of radiation found that X-raying pregnant women caused the fetus to be genetically injured in a way that increased the rate of cancer in children. It took about 10 years for that to be recognized and to decrease the radiation exposure of pregnant women. But the government was essentially censoring everything published and ruining the careers of researchers who spoke out.

My main concern was a biologist and physicist named John Gofman. I considered him the ultimate in corrupt mouthpiecing for the government through the 50s and 60s. Suddenly, he described an event where he was speaking the government line—saying we can't stop bomb tests because we don't know yet if the exposure will cause lethal mutations. As he was speaking, he realized he was saying insane things. He had been saying them for 20 years, but when it dawned on him that he was saying criminally insane things, he switched sides and began an honest investigation. Immediately, his research money was cut off. He was fired and went into private publicizing of the problems for the rest of his life.

The radiation health journals were basically owned by the nuclear industry. The public health organizations concerned with protecting the public were agencies of the industry. When I was in graduate school, our lab director decided we should have a course in radiation safety. We went to Oregon State University, and I have never seen a university operate at such a low level. The biology department was heavily influenced by agriculture, herbicides, and insecticides, but apparently, the nuclear industry got to them too.

**Andrew Murray:** Maybe he was making it out to be a harmless substance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Basically taking the line that there's a threshold below which it's totally safe or even beneficial.

**Andrew Murray:** I'm surprised he didn't eat some in front of you.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of their main lines of argument is that in small doses, it's supposed to be good for you. The Atomic Energy Commission called their project "Project Sunshine."

## Censorship and "The War on Cancer"

**Andrew Murray:** I want to question you about the freedom to do research. You’ve mentioned that freedom is restricted by the same forces that shape publication. How does this shape the publication itself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same companies that control funding. Even though money might come from the government and taxpayers, the culture is set by the industry. Gilbert Ling happened to have one person in the funding oversight branch of the NIH who thought objective research should continue. When that person retired, his funding was cut off.

The same thing happened to a famous astronomer named Halton Arp. He photographed galaxies that were obviously connected by a band of matter, yet one galaxy showed a very different redshift from the other. You can't have a single object connected by a band of matter with one end going at a vast speed away from the other. This essentially proved that the idea that redshift indicates acceleration away from the viewer must be wrong. They cut off his access to the telescopes so he couldn't use them again. He had to leave the country to do his work.

**Andrew Murray:** You also mentioned the "War on Cancer" as a complete failure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people who wage those wars and convince the government to fund them—whether it's heart disease, dementia, or cancer—always love the line of research that enriches the drug companies. They aim at a solution involving a drug that can sustain patients. They don't want to cure the patients at a low price; they want to keep the customers buying.

**Andrew Murray:** You also mentioned that personalized, tumor-specific chemotherapy is ridiculous mechanistically.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The traditional approach to medicine, going back to the Greeks, looked for general principles that would go wrong and be correctable. Their approach—diet, exercise, herbs—was designed to adjust the constitution and make physiology go in a healthy direction. That is still scientifically valid. It is the only practical solution to degenerative chronic diseases.

However, although it is the primary scientific problem in biology, it is constantly attacked as unscientific. What they want is a mechanism that leads to a specific drug. Preferably, it will be so variable that it requires great diagnostic effort and more drugs. If you try to look at the organism as a whole, it is considered pre-scientific.

## Digestion, Enzymes, and Cooking Vegetables

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line. Caller, where are you from?

**Sean (Caller):** My name is Sean from Buffalo. I was listening to a previous broadcast on endotoxins. I have a question about digestion as you age. Even if you eat well-cooked vegetables or dairy, it seems that if your hydrochloric acid (HCL) or enzymes are missing, you're going to be exposed to endotoxins. What is your view on taking digestive enzymes, HCL, or pepsin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pancreatic enzymes are very much like our own and can be effective for someone deficient in enzymes. Stress and aging often slow down the digestive process. However, they are made from raw animal tissue. You can't get the enzymes out without sterilizing it, and if you sterilize it, the enzymes are inactivated. So, you take the risk of whatever infection the animal had.

There are plant enzymes, papain and bromelain, which I think are pretty safe, but they only digest proteins. The non-animal enzymes that digest fats and carbohydrates happen to come from a fungus, and there is a risk of allergens from the fungus.

I think the best approach is to keep your energy and nutrition up so that your own stomach, pancreas, and liver produce the proper enzymes. Also, consider the chemistry of the plant. If you chew a raw vegetable or seed, the enzymes released are often defensive enzymes for the plant. For example, chewing raw bean sprouts or alfalfa sprouts can release toxins. I think someone calculated that 3 ounces of alfalfa sprouts would release a lethal dose of cyanide if you chewed them up thoroughly.

**Sean (Caller):** But if you cook the daylights out of root vegetables or leaves for 40 minutes, that issue goes away, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you process vegetables properly, you can get good nutrition. But cows and goats are designed to do that for us. Milk and cheese are basically detoxified plant nutrition. To do that industrially is possible, but getting all the PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) out is one problem. Getting the right ratio of nutrients is another. Leaves have good calcium and magnesium, but other parts of the plant have a bad ratio of phosphate to calcium. You don't want too much iron, phosphate, or unsaturated fat. Those are pro-stress, pro-aging chemicals.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think about using herbs like dandelion root as a cholagogue to support bile production, and bitters like gentian for stimulating HCL?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's an extremely valuable use of herbal remedies—to stimulate digestion.

**Sean (Caller):** So if you took gentian, you would stimulate HCL and pepsin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And the aroma of food is extremely important. If you don't enjoy your food or if you're anxious while eating, you will mess up your digestive secretion.

## 3D Ultrasound and Ancient Medicine

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take the next caller.

**Mike (Caller):** I'm calling from Garberville. About 15 years ago, I saw something called 3D computer-enhanced ultrasound that showed bones perfectly without radiation. Also, the ancient Sumerians wrote about hemp root extract for epilepsy. And years ago, my health was saved by ancient Tibetan acupuncture.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, have you heard of the 3D enhanced ultrasound?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are instruments that can detect cavities in teeth much better than X-rays using ultrasound. It gives a three-dimensional picture. A company in Washington announced they were coming out with the technology, but they say it won't be available for a few years.

## Glyphosate Exposure Protocol

**Andrew Murray:** Next caller, you're on the air.

**Guy (Caller):** Hi, I'm from Garberville. I wanted to talk about glyphosate. I've had some recent unfortunate exposure due to employment with some highly concentrated stuff. What would you recommend to prevent prolonged effects?

**Andrew Murray:** The monograph for glyphosate says it is readily excreted. I would imagine supporting the liver and kidneys is important. Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of insecticides and herbicides are oil-soluble, such as 2,4-D. But glyphosate, luckily, is water-soluble. However, it comes in products like Roundup, Touchdown, and Brush Master.

**Guy (Caller):** What if you mix 2,4-D with diesel fuel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Then it's oil-soluble. When it gets in your body, it tends to stay in your brain and fat. Glyphosate, even though it is a nerve, cancer, and endocrine disruptor, is not oil-soluble, so it leaves the body quickly. But it leaves behind damage—genetic damage, mitochondrial damage, and nerve disruption.

If you think you have accumulated chemicals like 2,4-D, adding vitamin E protects you as you detoxify the fats. Otherwise, it's a matter of keeping your energy up to restore the mitochondria and nerves. Vitamin E, thyroid, aspirin, and some of the protective steroids like pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone can protect against many of those environmental oil-soluble toxins.

**Guy (Caller):** I can definitely say there has been a downturn in my energy levels since being exposed. Thank you.

## Thyroid, T3, and Selenium

**Andrew Murray:** Next caller.

**Alex (Caller):** Hi, I'm calling from New Hampshire. I have a question about taking thyroid hormone. I've been taking about 60 micrograms of T3 spaced out every hour, and T4 in the evenings. If I take too much T4, will it get turned into reverse T3? I haven't been able to get my body temperature above 97.5.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's possible if you're under stress. Cortisol and adrenaline can shift the metabolism of T4 into reverse T3. I would check your general nutrition and make sure you're having seafood about once a week. Selenium is the most crucial nutrient for making sure you're converting T4 as needed. Your brain, kidneys, and skin have the equipment for converting T4 to T3, but they need selenium to do that.

**Andrew Murray:** Mushrooms are also a good source of selenium.

## Open Access Journals

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, do you think the Open Access movement is a valid institution? I found an article by Jeffrey Beall stating that advocates ignore the exploitative practices and poor quality of many open access journals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Jeffrey Beall made some good points about the possible corruption of open access. It can be used as personal advertising for researchers who pay a publisher to publish junk. However, if you read critically, you can find very good stuff. The Public Library of Science (PLOS) has had a really good record of getting novel information out to the public that would have been censored by the regular journals owned by the industry.

## High Altitude vs. High Rise Living

**Andrew Murray:** Next caller.

**Caller:** I had a question about living in a high-rise. It's been reported that heart attacks and strokes are higher, suspected to be due to being farther away from the earth's magnetic field.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are good studies in New Mexico showing that heart attacks and mortality from heart disease decreased with each step up in altitude. For over 100 years, insurance companies have known about the benefits of living at very high altitudes. Cancer mortality is much lower.

There are several changes: more ultraviolet light increases vitamin D, thyroid hormone tends to shift to the active T3 form, and the lower oxygen pressure makes you retain carbon dioxide. Higher CO2 facilitates brain oxidation, so dementia is much lower at high altitude.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you know of any benefits of living in a high-rise building specifically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One issue is that the stuff over your head reacts with cosmic rays. Researchers used half an inch of lead as a roof over rabbit cages, and those rabbits quickly miscarried and developed degenerative diseases. They found it was tertiary cosmic rays caused by the high probability of a cosmic ray causing a nuclear reaction in the lead.

One cosmic ray would produce a shower of intense secondary and tertiary radiation. The lower you are, the more toxic the radiation is because the dense atmosphere produces more of these rays. When you're on the bottom floor of a big building, you're going to have a lot more of the tertiary toxic cosmic rays and less of the high-altitude, high-energy cosmic rays that go right through you without doing harm.

## Skin Health

**Andrew Murray:** We have time for one quick question.

**Caller:** I'm from New York. I had a skin rash I talked to Dr. Peat about. He suggested a sodium chloride bath and dry CO2. It went away but keeps coming back. Is there anything else? I'm taking probiotics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D and thyroid are the most important things I know of for skin problems.

**Caller:** Vitamin A and D together?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not necessarily. You don't want to overdo the vitamin A. But vitamin D works on the intestine to control endotoxin and the skin reaction.

**Andrew Murray:** I'm afraid we have to cut you short. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time. For those listening, visit www.raypeat.com for fully referenced articles. Until next month, my name is Andrew Murray.
