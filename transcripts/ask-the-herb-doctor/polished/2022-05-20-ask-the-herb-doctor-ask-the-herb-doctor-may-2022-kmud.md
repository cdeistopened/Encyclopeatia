## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's May 2022 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. Sarah is not joining us this evening, but she will be back next month. It is a beautiful spring evening here in Garberville and Humboldt County—warm, clear, and bright.

We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us with his expertise. As always, from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you are invited to call in with questions. The number is 707-923-3911.

I also want to mention that if there are people who do not like to talk on air but have a question, you can leave a succinct, five-word question with the engineer, and he will pass it on to me.

Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. For those who may have never heard of you before, would you please outline your professional and scientific background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 50s and 60s, I was working in humanities—literature, painting, and philosophy. My interest in how consciousness works led me to decide that understanding language and art would help to understand what the brain is and how the brain is conscious. I went back to graduate school in 1968 at the University of Oregon, intending to concentrate on brain studies. However, I found that the department working on the brain was extremely dogmatic.

I looked around and found that at the other end of the organism—the reproductive system—the professors were actually scientific and didn't throw out data just because it didn't agree with the dogma. I did my dissertation on the oxidative aging process as it relates to the reproductive system. It turned out that this gives a very interesting background to things such as how the brain works. This was a theme existing in biology 100 years ago—how electrons and biological energy power perceptions and consciousness—but it had been squeezed out. Right from the early years of science, the corporations were squeezing out freely exploring researchers and subsidizing people who would work for their corporate interests.

## Mass Formation Psychosis and Technocracy

**Andrew Murray:** I want to back up a little from last month. We have been skeptical, to say the least, of the organization and rollout of the COVID pandemic since early 2020. At this point, it seems to have fizzled into a non-event compared to what was forecast. However, something perpetuated during this pandemic was a "mass formation psychosis" of the population's mindset. This international psychosis allowed directives and guidance from governments and health organizations to override personal sovereignty.

We are seeing the current administration potentially giving parts of our national sovereignty away to the World Health Organization and the United Nations, which is alarming. The UN has perpetuated much of what happened during this pandemic.

This ties into the subject of transhumanism and the World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab has spoken about the "Great Reset," suggesting people will "own nothing and be happy." Looking at the stock market recently, we are seeing significant losses, perhaps signaling a recession or collapse that could serve as a scapegoat for this reset.

When I looked at technocracy and transhumanism, it makes sense that governments want control over their populations. They now have vast amounts of data and algorithms to predict behavior. Dr. Peat, transhumanism is the premise that biological evolution will be overtaken by genetic, wearable, and implantable technologies that artificially expedite the evolutionary process. What are your thoughts on this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1940s and 50s, I knew people who had become convinced members of Technocracy Incorporated. The stock market has been one of the techniques to take over the assets of the world. Every time the value of the stock collapses, small investors get killed, and the giant corporations get bigger. It is like a ratchet to shake loose the bulk of the investors and refine ownership to a smaller group.

People injured by the economic breakdown in 1930 were well-meaning but gullible; they thought if we turned the economy over to scientists and engineers, they would prevent collapses. Except the scientists and engineers were working for the big corporations that engineered the collapse.

This was a sign of the shakedown of ownership. The corporations took control in the 19th century, and 1950 was a turning point when the government stated that "big science" is the only science, and the government must direct, finance, and control it. There hasn't been any pretense of science being a free enterprise since then. The journals and universities were taken over by the funding of giant corporations and government agencies.

**Andrew Murray:** Technocracy often couches its language in terms like "green economy" and "sustainable development." While I agree with abolishing fossil fuels for less polluting alternatives, the interpretation of these terms by technocrats paints a different picture. It seems to be about steering humanity toward a specific end game.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The way they manipulate science is in the background. It involves selling an ideology to the general population which justifies a reductionist view of biology. The intelligence of the organism has been ruled out of science in favor of randomness. Evolution is supposedly a matter of infinite random events.

People like Barbara McClintock, who in the 1940s and 50s showed that plants (specifically corn) use intelligent modification of their own genes to improve their situation, were ruled out of the functional world of science. She wasn't invited to conferences or published for decades.

Later, when Monsanto was criticized for creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the dangers of their insecticides like Roundup, the narrative changed. In the universities, professors went along with the idea that genetic engineering would be done by "smart people" like them, so nothing could go wrong.

## Caller: Endometriosis and Progesterone

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line.

**Caller (Los Angeles):** My wife has been having prolonged bleeding. She started taking progesterone—2.5 milligrams—and it helped cut the bleeding off, but when she stops, the bleeding continues. They found something on the ultrasound and want to do a hysteroscopy and curettage. If they find abnormal cells, what would be the next step to reverse this?

**Andrew Murray:** Let's clarify: is it actual progesterone or a progestin?

**Caller:** It says "Meth-progesterone."

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I assume that is medroxyprogesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and 2.5 milligrams of real progesterone wouldn't do anything. That can't be real progesterone.

**Caller:** It was prescribed. She was on 10 milligrams, but it gave her headaches, so they lowered it.

**Andrew Murray:** Has she tried natural progesterone?

**Caller:** No, she hasn't tried natural progesterone or thyroid. It is hard to get her into the rhythm of supplements. I am wondering if Dr. Peat thinks she should take the tests if there are abnormal cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The function of thyroid is to increase natural progesterone production while decreasing estrogen. It has a very high success rate in endometriosis because that condition is caused by a thyroid deficiency with estrogen excess.

I have known several people whose symptoms disappeared on the very first day of correcting their thyroid function. I tracked about 36 women who were told they needed a biopsy or partial hysterectomy due to abnormal cells. Within a month of using supplements, including thyroid, every one of those 36 women went back and the doctors could find no evidence of abnormal cells.

**Caller:** Is there a desiccated thyroid available on the market that is well tolerated?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but keep in mind that T4 is a stabilizing influence with a half-life of about two weeks. If you try to get a quick effect with a T4-containing product like Armour Thyroid or Cynoplus, you might have a good effect immediately, but you will overdose after four or five days.

**Caller:** What about the hysteroscopy and biopsy? Are you in favor of those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can stop the symptoms of too much bleeding and pain very quickly with a combination of the right hormone—thyroid and progesterone—then within a couple of weeks, the abnormal cells will probably have been normalized or shed.

**Andrew Murray:** Please stay on the line. We have another caller who has experience with this issue.

## Caller: Shared Experience with Endometriosis

**Caller (Female):** I wanted to tell you I had a similar situation five years ago. I went to the hospital, and they wanted to do a hysterectomy. I used Progest-E (the kind Ray recommends), Cynoplus, and Cytomel. As soon as I got my T3 up, the bleeding stopped. I continue to use progesterone to this day. They wanted to do radiation and drugs that caused blood clots, but I refused.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you. I will connect you two off-air so you can share information.

## GMOs and Patents

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you were speaking about Barbara McClintock earlier.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. After silencing her for decades, when Monsanto ran into the reality that their process was deadly, they decided they needed propaganda. They claimed that since Barbara McClintock demonstrated plants use genetic engineering naturally, it must be safe for Monsanto to do it. This is a total misunderstanding of what biology is.

**Andrew Murray:** That ties into the GMO issue here in Humboldt. We had an initiative to ban GMOs because organic farmers were getting sued by Monsanto when GMO pollen contaminated their crops. Now, it seems companies are obtaining patents on biological material, which was previously considered unpatentable.

**Engineer:** The virologists have patented segments of viral genomes so that if a future pandemic contains that segment, they can patent the vaccine for it.

**Andrew Murray:** Exactly. We covered this with the work of David Martin, who showed that patents on coronaviruses have been issued since the early 2000s.

## Caller: Vitamin D

**Caller (Shelter Cove):** I'd like to mention that Vitamin D is extremely important for women, especially entering menopause. I had extremely low levels—down to 16—which contributed to my Hashimoto's diagnosis.

**Andrew Murray:** I totally agree. Vitamin D deficiency is rampant. It is crucial for calcium metabolism, antiviral immunity, and anti-cancer benefits. A supplement of 5,000 IU a day should get most people into a good range.

## Medical Censorship and Legislation

**Andrew Murray:** I want to ask about the doctor-patient relationship. California Assembly Bill 2098 is currently moving through the assembly. It would make it easier for the Medical Board of California to discipline doctors who promote "COVID-19 misinformation" by classifying it as unprofessional conduct.

This essentially makes it illegal for a doctor to use their professional judgment if it contradicts the "party line." It threatens the confidentiality and open debate necessary for science. Dr. Peat, what do you think of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Until recently, the medical licensing system was used to exclude alternate theories of medicine, such as chiropractic, homeopathy, and herbal therapies. The doctors were fine with that monopoly. But now, the government has decided that doctors don't even have the power to define what their own monopoly believes. The government has taken away that autonomy. Now, the government is the final and only word on what constitutes medicine.

**Andrew Murray:** This reminds me of the "Ministry of Truth." The Department of Homeland Security announced a Disinformation Governance Board. Although it has been put on pause, it seems the administration wants control over the narrative.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government has been working directly through giant organizations like Facebook and Wikipedia all along. They simply gave orders. These companies were created with funding from the Pentagon, so they have been committed to cooperating with the government. Thousands of accounts are being closed by the recommendation of the government, so they don't really need a formal agent to do what they have been doing all along.
