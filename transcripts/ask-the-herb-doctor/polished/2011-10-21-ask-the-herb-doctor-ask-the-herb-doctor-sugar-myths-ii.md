## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Hi and welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

It's become increasingly obvious over the last few years that if you really want to get the point across, you cannot just mention it once or twice. You have to remind people of the subject and bring out the science and the proof. "Counterculture" is a good way to describe this—refreshing people's memories that what they hear and see is not always the way it is. It is up to us individually to take responsibility for our own actions and decisions by seeing the broader picture and finding the information that is freely available.

We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us here again for this month's show to bring his wisdom and research to bear upon these subjects. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** First of all, for the benefit of any new listeners, would you like to describe your academic and research background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My academic career went from linguistics to biology, and there was a continuity of a sort. From studying grammar and the structure of language, I moved to thinking about strictly biological questions. In linguistics, I was concentrating on how culture interacts with the structure of language. I was seeing the evolution of understanding in the culture as being what shapes the way the grammar itself works.

For various reasons, I switched over to biology, thinking to understand the brain better—the brain as the organ that carries culture and language. When I went from brain work to reproductive physiology, I was still interested in those questions of how the context interacts with the structure. Going from the brain to other aspects of physiology, I saw that the environment is a part of the organism. That accounts for my orientation in biology: concentrating on the interaction moment by moment between the animal and the environment.

## Ideology in Science

**Andrew Murray:** Before we get started on a continuation of last month's subject—sugars and the debunking of the cholesterol heart disease myth—I think it would be useful to understand your perspective. You've spent 40 years researching these areas. How often do you find that mainstream science conflicts with the evidence that you find?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a constant, almost daily experience in my attending lectures. I was really surprised anytime a professor said anything that I thought really related meaningfully to the biological facts. There was a book used as a text called *Classical Papers in Genetics*. Reading through that, I couldn't find any case in which the facts were honestly presented. It was really a little handbook of ideology. My experience with the academic science people was that they are very heavy on ideology and very light on facts. I almost never saw a science professor in the science library, and I spent many years every day reading in the library.

## The Benefits of Fructose

**Andrew Murray:** Let's get into the meat of this month's program on sugars. In your last newsletter, you mentioned that the addition of fructose to glucose during intraportal infusion increased the net glucose uptake, even when insulin secretion was compromised, as in diabetics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They refer to that as a catalytic property of fructose. It doesn't just increase the metabolism and uptake of glucose, but it increases the whole metabolism of the animal. In several types of experiments, they've seen a 50% increase in the whole metabolic rate. That's basically why I'm so interested in the effects of fructose.

My research had to do with aging, oxidative metabolism, and the perversion of oxidative energy production with aging, toxins, hormones, and unsaturated fats. The thyroid hormone is what basically distinguishes humans from fungus and bacteria. The higher the development of the brain, the more oxidative energy production is needed. The development of a baby's brain prenatally is very closely tied to the amount of glucose it metabolizes. Restrict the glucose to the baby, and the brain is smaller; feed it extra glucose, and the brain is bigger.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Just to go over a little bit of sugar science for our listeners: Everybody's familiar with white sugar, which is sucrose. Sucrose is half fructose and half glucose. All fruits contain approximately the same ratio of fructose and glucose as white sugar. However, other sources of carbohydrates like grains, beans, starches, bread, pasta, and potatoes are almost all glucose; they are devoid of fructose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the only place fructose slows down glucose is in the absorption from the intestine. Fructose itself is slow to be absorbed compared to glucose. If you eat starch like white rice or white bread, you'll get a very sharp increase in blood glucose. That stimulates insulin to handle the rising glucose, and that stimulates cortisol to prevent the reverse reaction from too much insulin. But when you eat sugar, the glucose half is broken off and the fructose lags a little bit in being absorbed.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's why it's a safer sugar for diabetics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The glucose from the sugar gets absorbed, and then the smaller amount of fructose coming in accelerates the absorption of the glucose by the various tissues—not just the liver, but brain, kidney, heart, everything. It is fulfilling some of insulin's responsibility without having to call on the insulin. Under some circumstances, it can actually inhibit the release of insulin, preventing the spiking of insulin while taking care of insulin's work.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, a diabetic's problem is that they have high sugar in their blood, and they need their cells to pick that up. When the fructose is combined with the glucose, the fructose is actually helping the cells pick up the glucose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It stimulates the cells to take up glucose very much the way insulin does. You can't distinguish the effects on some of the crucial enzymes. Fructose, and the pyruvic acid that it turns into, stimulate the enzymes that oxidize pyruvic acid just the same way insulin stimulates that same enzyme. One replaces the other perfectly.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If a diabetic eats whole grains or beans, they don't have the same ability to use that sugar because it's mainly glucose. They end up with elevated sugar numbers and elevated insulin. Diabetics are told to avoid orange juice and white sugar and eat whole grains, but that's exactly the opposite of what I've seen work in our clinic. When diabetics avoid the starches and eat honey, white sugar, and fruits, their sugar numbers become much more manageable.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was in 1874 that someone first published a paper on the fact that fructose is metabolized by diabetics where glucose isn't. After the publication of that paper, it was fairly common for people to recommend the use of fructose or sucrose to diabetics rather than plain glucose.

## Fats, Sugar, and Diabetes

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You don't often find a food that just has white sugar or honey in it. It's usually combined with a carbohydrate or fat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Worse than that, polyunsaturated fats are very often combined as shortening in bakery products. The enzyme I mentioned before, pyruvic dehydrogenase—which is activated by insulin or fructose to handle the oxidation of glucose—happens to be activated also by saturated fatty acids, but it is *inhibited* by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

The big overall diet change in the US over the last 40 years has been a slight decrease in sugar, a slight increase in starch, and a big 7% increase in added fats. Most of those fats are unsaturated because of the fear of saturated fats. Already in the 1960s, polyunsaturated fats were recognized to be the diabetogenic factors. They interfere with the ability to oxidize glucose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Don't they also destroy the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Every place you look, the polyunsaturated fats contribute to diabetes and obesity.

**Andrew Murray:** What's your opinion on the possibility of regenerating islet cells in the pancreas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar itself, sucrose, is known to stimulate the regeneration of beta cells. That was in my newsletter about a year ago, describing the early treatment of diabetes with glucose and looking at new in vitro studies where sugar stimulates regeneration and polyunsaturated fats kill the beta cells. Sugar often gets the blame for things the polyunsaturated fats do, such as the glycation of hemoglobin (HbA1c). Most of the so-called glycation is really the oxidative breakdown fragments of the polyunsaturated fats.

**Andrew Murray:** So a person's HbA1c could be lowered if they avoided all polyunsaturated oils?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** A really bad example of a way to eat sugar is a donut: white flour (glucose) fried in canola, sunflower, or corn oil (PUFA). You have pure glucose and pure polyunsaturated fatty acids blocking your cells from using that glucose. A good example is ice cream with fresh fruit. There you have a saturated fat and the fruit providing fructose.

## Inflammation: Sugar vs. Starch

**Andrew Murray:** You also mentioned fat peroxidation involved in the degenerative disease process. Despite fructose increasing the production of uric acid, you noted that uric acid is an endogenous anti-inflammatory.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's considered to be our main antioxidant. Most inflammatory signals come from oxidative breakdown products. Uric acid is our basic antioxidant and a major anti-inflammatory factor.

**Andrew Murray:** But the oxidation of these polyunsaturates has a very strong inflammatory effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The fish oil type breaks down much faster than the seed oils. By the time it gets from your food into your bloodstream, there is so much free radical activity that it poisons some of your enzymes involved in immunity. That immune-suppressive effect is what people mistake for an anti-inflammatory effect in fish oils. The seed oils don't even have that temporary toxic apparent benefit; they are flat-out inflammatory.

**Andrew Murray:** There was a study where people were given a 300-calorie drink containing either glucose, fructose, or orange juice. Those receiving the glucose had a large increase in oxidative inflammatory stress, but it was absent in those receiving the fructose or orange juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has ramifications for the immune system and bone cells. About 35 years ago, someone fed groups of rats either a high starch diet or a high sugar diet. Some groups were Vitamin D deficient. The Vitamin D deficient group on starch had rickets-type bones—poorly calcified and weak. But those on the high sucrose diet without Vitamin D had strong, well-calcified bones. It apparently was the increased carbon dioxide production from the catalyzed higher metabolic rate. Carbon dioxide is largely responsible for proper calcification of bone.

## Exercise and CO2

**Andrew Murray:** Does a higher CO2 content actually allow extracellular calcium to move into bone stores?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The first bone material laid down is calcium carbonate. In vitro experiments showed that you can have an acidic condition as long as it's based on carbon dioxide and have strong bones. The same amount of lactic acid pH will cause dissolution of the bones. Starch tends to produce a shift towards lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this why you say oxidative exercise like aerobics or jogging is bad for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It has taken about 40 years for the science to get to the trainers, but the East Europeans were the first to limit the training their athletes did. They won a lot of Olympic medals by "under training"—cutting the exercise short before the lactic acid rises enough to poison the system. A minute or two is enough. Lactic acid turns on the stress hormones that destroy your muscles, nerves, and bones.

**Andrew Murray:** And aerobic exercise depletes your own CO2 stores.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The typical well-trained long-distance runner has been found to have basically defective lung function. The chronic elevation of lactic acid causes thickening of the air sacs, making the path of oxygen diffusion longer, so it poorly oxygenates their blood. It leads first to water-logging inflammation and eventually to fibrosis.

## Brown Sugar vs. White Sugar

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about the brown sugar movement—the idea that brown sugar, raw sugar, or molasses is a better replacement for white sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an extreme situation of poverty, crude brown foods—brown bread, brown rice, molasses—are important sources of nutrients. But when people start eating more fat and protein, they can stand to lose the nutrients in those to gain freedom from toxins and inflammation. In molasses, it turns brown partly because the sugars are being caramelized. Minerals catalyze the oxidation, combining sugar molecules and changing them. These become, to various degrees, toxic, allergenic, and even potentially carcinogenic.

## Caller: Sugar Cravings and Coffee

**Caller 1:** My son is 34 and he drives me nuts about his sugar intake. When we go out for breakfast, he will pour the sugar holder into his coffee. I tell him it causes diabetes, but he doesn't listen. He's had kidney stones. Is there information I can give him?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a natural tendency for people who have a hormone imbalance, especially hypothyroidism, to crave sugar. Hypothyroidism makes your liver unable to store glycogen effectively. I was always craving sugar until I took thyroid medication at about 40 years old. I suddenly had no more sugar cravings and could go eight hours without getting shaky.

**Caller 1:** He's had kidney stones. Aren't those influenced by sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think so. Only in the sense that if you let sugar displace sources of calcium, magnesium, and protein, then you tend to form stones. Parathyroid hormone and inflammatory factors tend to create mineralization of soft tissues and stones.

**Caller 1:** What test should he get?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D3 is one relevant thing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The fact that he's adding white sugar to his coffee is probably protective. Coffee lowers your blood sugar. If he has pure black coffee, he'll end up lowering his blood sugar. If he's craving sugars, he's probably figured out that coffee with sugar makes him feel better. It's easier for his body to use the white sugar than a pile of pancakes. He should get his thyroid and Vitamin D checked.

## Caller: Balancing Sugar with Protein

**Caller 2 (Tesha):** I want to encourage listeners to listen with an open heart. Could you expound on the importance of balance? When you consume sugar, you need fat and protein, and vice versa.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The amino acids in protein are strong stimulants of insulin secretion. If you eat protein without sugar, the insulin will lower your blood sugar. To prevent the blood sugar from dropping, you produce adrenaline or cortisol. If your liver doesn't have glycogen stored, you depend on cortisol, which activates the conversion of protein to sugar and fat. You end up destroying a big part of the protein you've just eaten.

To handle protein efficiently, you need glucose or fructose to steady your blood sugar. The fat does several things: saturated fat works with fructose and insulin to handle glucose oxidation, and fat slows absorption so you don't get a surge of glucose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So everything has to be kept in balance with proteins and good saturated fats like coconut oil and butter.

**Andrew Murray:** Some top fructose sources that also contain glucose are dates (32% fructose, plus B vitamins and minerals) and raisins. What do you think about agave?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The fact that they mention "fructans" likely means it's being produced enzymatically from the core of the agave plant—waste product from tequila production—rather than from the juice.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you give us examples of good food combining?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruit and cheese would be a basic thing for snacks as well as meals.

## Caller: Dextrose and Pancreatic Health

**Caller 3:** I wanted to ask about dextrose. I see it in medicine. Also, regarding Steve Jobs and pancreatic cancer—what helps regenerate pancreatic cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dextrose is just another word for glucose. Starch turns into that. It is great stuff in itself when balanced with fructose, saturated fat, minerals, and vitamins. Glucose itself is a factor in helping the pancreas to regenerate. It's the polyunsaturated fats which misdirect the metabolism of glucose and create the epidemic of diabetes, obesity, cancer, and Alzheimer's.

**Engineer:** Do they call it dextrose when it's used industrially?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has to do with the optical rotation of the molecule. Fructose was called levulose because it turns light to the left. Dextrose is glucose.

## Caller: Diet and Back Pain

**Caller 4:** I stopped eating meat, mostly. I eat a little lamb, pork, and a lot of fish. I stopped drinking coffee, using milk, and white sugar. I have a lower back condition.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Honey has all the virtues of ordinary sucrose and some special benefits, such as antiseptic materials. But ordinary white sugar has many of those same properties. They've done major surgery where they filled the wound with white crystalline sugar, and the person recovered with fewer scars than with antibiotics.

Regarding your back, I think you probably have a slight weakness of thyroid function. Meat eaters often get symptoms including arthritis if they eat too much meat in relation to their thyroid function. Low back symptoms are very common in thyroid problems. You want to check your temperature and pulse rate. Sometimes just a daily raw carrot will help make up for the thyroid deficiency by reducing bacterial toxins (endotoxin) that poison your liver.

**Caller 4:** What about kidney?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Same thing. Endotoxin absorbed from poorly digested plant material interferes with glucose oxidation and prevents the activation of thyroid hormone. That leads to inflammation, especially in cartilage. The discs between vertebrae tend to swell or become soft when you're thyroid deficient and have endotoxin.

**Caller 4:** I stopped doing milk. I eat eggs maybe twice a week.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You want to try to get at least 80 grams of good protein every day. If you aren't doing dairy, calcium would be the main thing to concentrate on. You should try powdering eggshells.

**Andrew Murray:** We need to wrap up. Thank you, Dr. Peat, so much for joining us. For those who have heard this evening's show, please check his website, www.raypeat.com. There are scientific reference articles to back up everything you've heard.
