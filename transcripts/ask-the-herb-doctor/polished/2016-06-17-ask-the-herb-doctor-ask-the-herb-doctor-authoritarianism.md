## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to *Ask Your Herb Doctor* on KMUD 91.1 FM. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbs, dietary supplements, and nutritional counseling.

Dr. Raymond Peat will be joining us to share his wisdom. This month, the subject is going to be a little political. I can't say it's not, because the subject we'll be covering involves fundamental tenets of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly that this great nation was founded on. We will invite callers to call in for questions related or unrelated to the political and physiological sides of the topic. The broad topic is authoritarianism. Just to couch those terms, authoritarianism would cover freedom of right, expression, religion, and assembly. We're going to bring out both a physiological perspective as well as mental and political perspectives.

Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us. For those who have just tuned in, would you give an outline of your scientific background and your research?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The relevant part of my science background is that I dissented against some of the fundamental ideas in all of the sciences, especially in biology. I had a master's degree in humanities from the University of Oregon for several years before I went to study biology from 1968 to 1972 for my PhD.

I found that when I followed the college instructor's directions to give the students different perspectives on scientific issues in a course called "Physics for Biology Majors," the trustees really didn't want their students to hear the other side of issues from the 1950s, such as the dangers of fallout from radiation or medical radiation. My whole activity over the years has been looking at dissenting ideas in all of the sciences.

## Authoritarianism in Academia

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned run-ins with various authoritarian figures within the academic community. There are people who come up with dissenting ideas that are vehemently opposed because they threaten the structures in place. How do you think that manifests itself in academia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1965, I saw a really interesting study by a professor at Oregon State University. She looked at the academic success of graduate students. She ranked the scores on the Miller Analogies Test, which measures mental flexibility as well as vocabulary. It's heavy on flexibility; they change the rules partway through.

She found that from the lowest academic achievers in graduate school, the lowest scores on that test corresponded nicely with academic success up to the straight-A students. But then, as the students' mental scores on the analogies test increased further, their grades decreased. The very highest on the mental abilities were very unsuccessful graduate students. That obviously is a matter of authoritarian fitting-in—being "other-directed" rather than being powered by curiosity and desire for knowledge—which really didn't fit in and made them fail.

## Fascism, Corporations, and Free Trade

**Andrew Murray:** Let's discuss politics in science and the framework in which those establishments are raised. We've discussed the German repatriation after the Second World War, Operation Paperclip, and how corporate assets and intellectual capability were seized and brought to America. We are seeing the emergence of news channels openly debating concepts that Donald Trump has been bringing out. He is definitely not a politician.

We have the counterpart in Hillary Clinton, who has been implicated in various issues. The dogma established by pharmaceutical companies with government lobbying power is opposed to free will and a constitutionally sound republic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The ruling class has defined the words. Mussolini clearly defined fascism as the blending of state power with corporate power. That is exactly what is now being called "free trade." The trade deals are essentially allowing the biggest corporations to impose their political standards on the rest of the world in an empire. Free trade is really subjecting political rules in other countries to the international corporations' benefit.

For example, the environment in Mexico has been deteriorating for several decades with the *maquiladora* industry. When NAFTA started, because corn can be grown industrially on a huge scale in the United States, subsidized corn had to be freely admitted into Mexico. This displaced people using subsistence methods who depended on growing their own corn. This subsidized cheap corn displaced farmers and created the influx of immigrants who are wanted for cheap labor on farms.

## Caller: Terminology and Digestion

**Caller (Callie):** I have two things. One, we don't have a good vocabulary. We use the word "fascism," but we need a word that describes the combination of capitalism with the police state covert operation situation. Second, a health question: How do you re-inoculate your stomach? I think sulfites might have killed off the enzymes or organisms that help me digest vegetables.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You mentioned sulfite as a problem. Sulfites are a preservative, antimicrobial, and a bleaching product. I think they might also help to initiate allergies that would be interactive with the microbes that are being damaged by the sulfites. The sulfites are a reductant, and the stress state is an exaggeratedly reduced state. Things that promote good oxidative metabolism can help the intestine greatly, keeping your thyroid in good condition.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And sulfites are anti-thyroid too, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Slightly antiseptic foods such as cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots, raw carrots, and saturated fats help to keep down the potentially toxic bacteria.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Saturated fats like coconut oil are antimicrobial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just keeping the digestive system stimulated and very active so that you tend to digest the germs rather than being digested by them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also, the one probiotic I found useful personally was Dr. Ron's Ultra Pure Probiotic. You mentioned feeling better digesting milk when eating cheese and yogurt; you do get a lot of natural probiotics from eating cultured dairy.

## Caller: Americanization and Language

**Caller (Local):** I have the word the previous gentleman was searching for. It's used by the State Department: "Americanization." We were trying to Americanize Vietnam, South America, and the Middle East. It is an empire thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wonder if he was old enough to remember when we had the House Un-American Activities Committee.

**Caller (Local):** I was born in 1957.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It sort of began when students had a protest in Washington against the House Un-American Activities Committee. They were really the most un-American part of society, trying to suppress all free thought.

**Caller (Local):** Absolutely. Thank you for the show.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have another comment on the question of language. I did my thesis on William Blake. In the late 1700s, he was writing things that were potentially disturbing to the ruling class. He was showing the way language was used to deceive the people. He would reverse the use of "heaven" and "hell" to show how radically the establishment was misusing language to impose its own ideas. The current public relations psychology working for political control has developed all during the 20th century. They are doing studies to find which words are most manipulative. The categories of right-wing, left-wing, and conservative are being manipulated deliberately.

## Caller: Political Correctness

**Caller:** I hear a lot about political correctness. What does that mean?

**Andrew Murray:** As I understand it, it is not having your own thoughts or saying what you feel for fear of upsetting somebody. It is essentially a tyranny. It is about the ruling class and their ideologies.

**Caller:** I know Donald Trump loves to talk about how he can't stand political correctness, but he says horribly slanderous things.

**Andrew Murray:** America has a freedom of expression mandate in its First Amendment. What is prohibited is physically harming someone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The media are amplifying the things Trump says and ignoring similar things that Hillary Clinton does. She is a big name-caller, except she is more politically correct in the way she does it. She does it to promote the possibility of war and expansion of empire. For example, she called Putin "Hitler" and said similar things about North Korea and China.

**Caller:** You sound like you like Donald Trump.

**Andrew Murray:** I do like some of his policies. From a business perspective, generating income for the least amount of money, I think he could do great things for this country.

**Caller:** He says he will bring back jobs, but he has companies in China. Isn't that hypocritical?

**Andrew Murray:** Most of these businesses have been forced out of the United States by the current political strategies. The climate in this country has been made so bad for them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some of those points were sounding like support for Bernie Sanders. I think his domestic policies are very traditional and actually conservative in the sense of conserving the standard of living and quality of life of working people.

## Caller: Thyroid Success Story

**Caller:** I have a health question. I am a client of Dr. Murray and started thyroid medication one week ago. I've noticed my lips are getting bigger and turning pink, and the pores are shrinking. The skin is completely changing. How is that physiologically happening?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The circulation increases as the metabolic rate is increased under the influence of thyroid. Cells start producing carbon dioxide, which opens up blood vessels. It also accelerates the normalizing processes, creating replacement cells rather than scar tissue. With aging, there's a tendency to fill in with fibrotic, useless connective tissue where replacement stem cells haven't been able to develop. A good supply of energy and oxygen can renew tissues.

My own experience when I was experimenting with DHEA, progesterone, and thyroid was that in my 40s, I grew more than an inch while losing belly fat. My muscles developed as the fat disappeared. Even at that age, my bones were elongating. The repair and regeneration effects of thyroid used to be talked about in the 1920s and 30s, but the pharmaceutical industry started suppressing the idea of treating hypothyroidism with thyroid supplements.

**Caller:** I've also noticed the green veins in my legs are becoming less apparent, as if they're going deeper.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both high cortisol and high estrogen make up for the metabolic deficiency in hypothyroidism. High cortisol causes little red dots or broken capillaries. High estrogen tends to weaken the basic muscle tone in the veins. Progesterone and thyroid restore the muscle tone so that the valves on the walls of the big veins work. If the vein relaxes, the valves don't work because the flaps can't reach each other. If you contract the veins under the influence of progesterone and thyroid, the valve will begin working and restore the function.

Also, the hormone Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is produced under the influence of high estrogen, stress, and inflammatory mediators. It tends to be much lower under the influence of thyroid. You don't need those extra abnormal blood vessels when your thyroid is functioning well.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there anything they should watch out for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you are taking a certain dose of thyroid, the thyroxine accumulates in your tissues with a half-life of two weeks. People will usually feel great as they increase their dose in the first week or two, but if you're taking more than you need, you will reach a point where you get out of breath or your heart will pound. You have to keep watching over a period of a few months. Also, watch for seasonal effects; you don't need as much thyroid in the summer as you do in the winter.

## Historical Context: 1933 and the Dulles Brothers

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to go back to Mussolini and Hitler. In 1933, the Reichstag building was burnt down. The very next day, an edict was announced that prevented political uprising. It suspended the Constitution. This led to the persecution of Jews and the rise of Nazism because they suppressed the ability of anyone to argue against it. That is why our First Amendment is so important.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You mentioned the import of German scientists after the war—Project Paperclip. A similar thing happened with the failure of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. These physicists who were imported had a very great inclination towards Nazism and fascism because John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles were working closely with Prescott Bush in supporting Hitler in the 1920s and 30s.

The Dulles brothers not only wanted to bring in the scientists for rocket science and weapons development, but they continued their support for the role that Hitler had played. A recent book by an Australian history professor has followed the role of the Dulles brothers. It shows how the Dulles and European fascist involvement in Indonesia was a very important factor in Kennedy's assassination, because Kennedy was within just a few weeks of changing policy in Indonesia, which would have ruined some of the investments the Dulles were involved in.

## Caller: The Gehlen Organization

**Caller:** I wanted to add a fragment of information. During the late 40s, regarding importing German scientists, we got the Gehlen Group. The upper echelon SS had false identities created for them. That was the work of Bill Donovan, the director of the OSS (precursor to CIA). They were fascinated by the cold and calculated methodology of the genocide and wanted that information.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The doctrine of eugenics actually went from the United States and England to Germany. Hitler put it into practice, but it never left American biology. The Americans have continued citing the work which was done scientifically to justify killing Jews, Slavs, and black people. These pseudo-scientific studies were essentially designed by Konrad Lorenz, who got a Nobel Prize. Our American geneticists have sort of worshiped these ideas of genetic determinism, including determinism of political belief.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We have to wrap up. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for your time. For those listening, Dr. Raymond Peat's website is RayPeat.com. It is full of physiological health articles.

The main point of all this is the concept in our Constitution that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have to be open to ideas and discussions. We don't want authoritarianism. This is a free speech radio station.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you for listening. Good night.
