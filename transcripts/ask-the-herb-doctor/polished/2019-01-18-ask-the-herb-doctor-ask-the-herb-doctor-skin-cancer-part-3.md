# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Skin Cancer, Cholesterol, and Viral Immunity

**Host:** Andrew Murray
**Guest:** Dr. Raymond Peat

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this January 18th, 2019 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. This month’s topic is wrapping up the last two discourses on skin cancer, but we are tying in the topic of oncogenes with viruses and epigenetics, and the viricidal activity of selected medicinal plants. There is a wealth of new articles being published on PubMed and other scientific peer-reviewed sites.

For those people who perhaps haven't heard of you and don't know too much about you, Dr. Peat, we'll just give a rundown of your academic and professional background before we get started.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I did graduate study in biology for a Ph.D. between 1968 and 1972 at the University of Oregon. Since then, I have been following up on some of the ideas that I worked on for my dissertation, which was basically aging and cell energy production. Among other things, that includes how hormones and foods promote viral immunity.

**Andrew Murray:** You're a big advocate of food-based help in terms of helping the organism recover homeostasis to fight infection, whether it's producing natural steroids or fighting bacteria and viruses. You spend a lot of time discussing the nutrition aspects of healing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The immune system ideas go way back. Before I went to graduate school in biology, I had read some of William F. Koch's research. Some of his colleagues found that the treatments he used for curing cancer also worked for curing animal diseases, such as mastitis in cows. He showed that the healthy cow could actually have more bacteria in its udder than the sick cow with mastitis, and that a healthy cow tolerated microorganisms without suffering damage from them.

That led me to get interested in the newer research. Jamie Cunliffe in England has what he calls the "damage theory" of immunity, in which the immune system really is a system for repairing tissue damage. If microorganisms cause damage, then the immune system will clear out the microorganisms, but that is a side effect of repairing the damage. Polly Matzinger, about the same time, came out with the "danger hypothesis." That is very similar, except it isn't quite as realistic as Jamie Cunliffe's, because it still leaves it open for seeing the microorganism as intrinsically dangerous. I think the facts indicate that we can tolerate microorganisms as long as they don't poison us.

**Andrew Murray:** Or if indeed we're not poisoned by the environment in which we live. It’s a grand idea to have that common root—that the body is intrinsically able to heal itself if you give it the right material.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you look at a viral disease epidemic, there are always people who don't succumb to it. You often find that they have contracted the infection and have antibodies to it, but it didn't make them at all sick, or only slightly sick.

## Melanoma and Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA)

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to clear up a few questions from last month about melanoma. Apparently, the incidence of melanoma has been on the rise exponentially since the 1980s.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think from before that. I've seen figures that it has increased 500% since about 1940. I'm pretty sure it's not sun exposure because it has an inverse relation with altitude. The change that I think is relevant is the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), which have increased just about at the same rate melanoma has.

**Andrew Murray:** Are you thinking this is because the polyunsaturates are energy depleting or producing lipid peroxidation in the skin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many of those things. The energy goes down and inflammation goes up. In the Veterans Administration study in the 1960s, supposedly to prevent heart disease, they gave a corn oil-based diet to one group and regular fats—including margarine, butter, and ordinary moderately unsaturated fats—to another. The group that got corn oil in their diet regularly, at the end of eight years, had three times the mortality from cancer. That was one of the industry's own studies. It relates to what you see in the animal studies: if you look at just linoleic acid, which was the original so-called "essential fatty acid," as the proportion of linoleic acid in the diet goes up, the cancer incidence and mortality goes up in proportion. They also interfere with the production and use of cholesterol.

## Altitude, Oxygen, and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** I was looking at an article with the headline: "Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation: evidence for oxygen as an inhaled carcinogen." You've always mentioned CO2 being protective, with longevity definitely increasing with elevation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The insurance companies have known for more than 100 years that cancer mortality in general decreases with altitude. It is very low in the high-altitude cities. As the oxygen pressure in the air increases, the carbon dioxide tends to decrease. They are competitive; the pressure of oxygen displaces the carbon dioxide bound to proteins in the blood.

**Andrew Murray:** So people at sea level are much more likely statistically to get cancer because they don't have the protective effect of CO2 that you'd get at altitude?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, CO2 is an anti-inflammatory protective factor.

## Statins, Cholesterol, and Skin Aging

**Andrew Murray:** I know you're completely against statins. You've always said that the elderly, or even people over 50, want a cholesterol level of 220 to 230. I saw from the pharmacology of statins that they block mevalonate, which is an upstream chemical. This can cause aneuploidy, which is a serious outcome.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you experimentally starve cells for cholesterol—the same thing that a statin does to the person—the cells in vitro are stuck in the tetraploid state. They can't do the reductive separation of chromosomes. Old people's skin is relatively loaded with cells stuck in that state because, with aging, the cells lose their ability to maintain the production of cholesterol. When they get stuck in that condition, if something forces them to divide, they get the number of chromosomes randomized as they divide, and that can produce cancer cells.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you see any protocol for rejuvenating skin cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the cosmetic industry, they're starting to put cholesterol in cosmetics. In effect, it does rejuvenate the cells. It restores their ability to divide healthfully.

**Andrew Murray:** So you can physically, topically apply cholesterol in the form of an ointment or a cream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what the experiments show, and the cosmetics companies are taking advantage of it. There is half as much cholesterol in old skin as in young skin.

**Andrew Murray:** From an anti-aging perspective, do you think there's much that can be done to restore the collagen or the scaffold in which the skin is normally elastic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the cells normally are able to turn it over. Energized cells can eat up the hardened, cross-linked, aged collagen and let the cells produce fresh collagen. The cholesterol lets the cells divide normally, so they are more energetic and produce a thicker layer of healthy cells rather than a scaly, hardened layer of aged, flaky cells. The practical way to keep your cholesterol synthesis ability is to avoid polyunsaturated fatty acids because they turn off the synthesis of cholesterol and interfere with its use in the cells.

## Brain Health and Lipid Turnover

**Andrew Murray:** You've always said that four years is a rough approximation for the turnover of lipids in the cell. How is this the same with the brain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every night there's a tremendous turnover of the lipids in the brain. But when you're asleep, your blood sugar falls and the free fatty acids tend to be liberated from your fat stores. So if you have bad fat in your fat tissue, during the night it's going to be in the blood vessels when your brain is remaking itself. If you can keep your blood sugar up or get your fat so that it's pretty saturated, then your brain remakes itself considerably every night.

**Andrew Murray:** What about hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) as a precursor to cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a precursor that supposedly helps to increase it. It's very important to get cholesterol up to 160 at least. Bodybuilders are the ones experimenting with this precursor, but I haven't heard much from them about its effectiveness.

## Caller Q&A: Cholesterol Ratios

**Caller (New York):** You said total cholesterol should be 225 to 230 for older people. Is that the only one that matters? What about triglycerides, LDL, and HDL?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your low-density cholesterol (LDL) is low, that increases the cancer risk and dementia risk. But the things that poison your liver or stress you increase the HDL. It happens that the protein that forms the HDL is anti-inflammatory, so it's a defensive reaction to stress. Estrogen and alcohol, for example, will increase the HDL defensively.

But the LDL is a protective source of the cholesterol. And if the triglycerides are fairly saturated, they aren't very harmful. They found that heart failure is actually less of a problem if your triglycerides are high. But if the triglycerides are polyunsaturated, that goes with interference with the function of the cholesterol. Free fatty acids are the dangerous form of fats in the blood; they have multiple interferences, for example with oxidative metabolism and the use of sugar. The triglycerides are pretty innocuous; they're just evidence that you're under stress and not using your sugar properly.

## Caller Q&A: Healing Ligaments and Scar Tissue

**Caller (New York):** If a 22-year-old sprains his ankle—torn ligaments, swelling—what are the three or four things you would do to make sure it heals properly? We're told scar tissue has to form, but we worry that leads to arthritis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do things to keep the free fatty acids low so that you use your glucose as efficiently as possible to produce anti-inflammatory things like carbon dioxide. Aspirin and niacinamide, for example, are anti-inflammatory things that reduce the disorganizing kind of scar tissue and promote maximum quality healing with a minimum of excess random collagen deposition.

Vitamin D and Vitamin K are very important. Getting enough calcium in your diet with Vitamin D so that you keep your parathyroid hormone suppressed helps keep the tissue energy high. Include salt in your diet to keep the aldosterone to a minimum, because aldosterone promotes disorganized collagen healing and fibrosis. So, some unexpected things: sodium and calcium in the diet are protective to the healing of connective tissue.

**Caller (New York):** If a doctor says the only way it heals is when scar tissue develops?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, good scar tissue is fine, but the worse your metabolism is, the more disorganized the scar tissue is. A keloid, for example, is terrible scar tissue—very disorganized because of polyunsaturated fats in your circulation. A baby in utero with no essential fatty acids in circulation and plenty of carbon dioxide will heal without any disorganized structures.

## Caller Q&A: Fungal Infections

**Caller (New York):** For a fungal toe, someone suggested mixing equal parts apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide and soaking it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Iodine is a good fungus killer. Vinegar is a pretty fair antagonist to the fungus. In combination with hydrogen peroxide, I imagine they work all right too. It sounds very safe. You can damage the tissue with too much hydrogen peroxide. Once I spilled some 30% peroxide on my finger and it turned strangely paper white. I stuck it in a bottle of ascorbic acid and in a flash it looked normal.

## Caller Q&A: Coconut Oil Sensitivity

**Caller (Calgary):** I followed your suggestion to take coconut oil, but every time I take it, it causes really bad digestive distress. I've tried the ultra-purified and the unrefined.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I found that the nice-tasting unrefined ones were harder on the intestine. The ultra-refined and even hydrogenated coconut oil, I find, is easiest on the intestine. If you put it on a hot frying pan and it smells, then it's more likely to hurt your intestine. It should be odorless when it hits a hot pan.

## Caller Q&A: Psychopathy and Metabolism

**Caller (Toronto):** What can an individual do who has an opportunity to intercept a psychopath? Is there anything that can be done to normalize a psychopath?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keeping the brain well energized, and that means keeping the blood sugar steady. Sometimes just a very digestible diet can make a person feel so much better that they don't have to exploit and manipulate other people.

**Caller (Toronto):** It might have something to do with the narcissistic quality, not wanting to eat or having low calorie intake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think the addictive personality that needs alcohol or drugs is somewhat in the same boat—needing something that they can't get themselves. They try to control others to make their life better. But if their life suddenly becomes better by changing metabolism... I've seen lifetime addicts to alcohol, heroin, or cocaine just overnight literally drop their addiction.

## Viruses, Exosomes, and Genetic Transfer

**Andrew Murray:** I want to ask about the role of viruses. Part of our genome is viral. I've always imagined viruses just to be the bad guys. Is there anything useful about viruses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A very large part of our genome resembles the retroviruses. Since viruses can only exist in the cells of higher animals, they obviously derive in some way from the higher animal's genetic material.

It's only in the last several years that western biochemists are starting to recognize that there are particles circulating in our blood and lymph system carrying genetic information. A Korean scientist 60 years ago claimed he discovered a third circulatory system which carries particles of genetic material. About 10 years ago, this was actually documented—not as a third circulatory system, but the fact that there are very small particles of nucleic acids circulating in the blood and lymph carrying genetic information to repair cells or change their functions.

They call these microvesicles or exosomes. They bud from the surface of cells and carry DNA, RNA, proteins, and other parts of cells that act as signals. For example, between a working organ like the lungs and the bone marrow producing stem cells. All of our organs are communicating with each other through these little particles that are about the size of viruses.

When bacteria are exposed to a dangerous environment, such as antibiotics or starvation, they are able to re-engineer their own genes to produce adaptive changes. When one bacterium achieves immunity, they can conveniently pack it up into a little exosome—a plasmid—which they pass onto their neighbors. So it spreads like a viral infection. It is a self-constructed virus that the bacteria pass on for the defense of the community.

Within our body, we are passing these little plasmids or microvesicles to different parts of the body. When we eat another organism, we incorporate some of their DNA into our own cellular DNA. You eat beef and you get some cow DNA; you eat carrots and you get some carrot DNA. In that sense, we're communicating across species all the time. I imagine that viruses have some of that function. I think we have the ability to look into our genetic reservoir to see what's useful. If our energy is very low, then they can cause trouble and interfere with our adaptation. But if our energy is high, I think getting these particles of genetic information can actually increase our repertoire.

## Caller Q&A: Gallbladder Issues

**Caller (West Haven):** My gallbladder is not functioning very well. I have fat intolerance. A friend recommended a grape fast.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago, I read a book called *The Grape Cure* by a South African doctor. That was one of the things that got me interested in the purple pigment in grapes and other fruits as a stimulant to proper oxygen use. Combined with sugar and the minerals in grape juice, it does have great therapeutic effects.

**Andrew Murray:** Caller, do you have obstruction or just deficient bile production?

**Caller (West Haven):** Fat intolerance. Nothing showing on ultrasound, but I have a mix of hypothyroid, mold sensitivity, and SIBO.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The gallbladder is very sensitive to low thyroid function or high estrogen in relation to progesterone. Progesterone relaxes it; estrogen tends to cause spasms. The sick reaction to fats is because the thresholds are lowered by the high estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. The key to it is almost always low thyroid function. Correct your metabolism by getting your body temperature up to daytime levels, typically around 98.6°F (37°C).

## Caller Q&A: Diarrhea and High Blood Pressure

**Caller (Eureka):** Do you know of any cause that would lead a person to develop digestive issues—frequent loose bowel movements—as well as high blood pressure? They came out of the blue at the same time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress physiology is generally involved in both inflammation and the tendency to diarrhea and high blood pressure. Low thyroid function with a TSH measurement up to 3 is often called normal, but anything above 1.0 is likely to promote inflammation, including in the intestine.

High serotonin is the main thing that contributes to an overactive bowel. It is also named for its ability to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. There are drugs that will lower it, such as cyproheptadine. But usually, you can change your diet to reduce the inflammatory foods, such as starches or raw/undercooked vegetables that support bacteria that cause the intestinal inflammation.

**Caller (Eureka):** So less starch and less raw vegetable matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Salads, bread, beans, nuts, and even potatoes can sometimes feed the bacteria that cause the inflammation and release serotonin. The simplest approach is to eat a bland fiber. Some people are okay with cooked oat bran as a mush, but some bacteria can feed on that. Cooked mushrooms and cooked bamboo shoots are bland fibers that will often lower the serotonin and diarrhea effect.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time. For those who have listened, Dr. Peat can be contacted through his website, www.raypeat.com. He has many well-written articles that are fully referenced. Until the third Friday of next month, good night.
