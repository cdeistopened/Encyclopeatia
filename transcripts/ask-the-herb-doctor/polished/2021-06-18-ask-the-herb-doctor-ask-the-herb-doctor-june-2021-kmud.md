## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have perhaps never listened to the shows before, they run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 to 8:00 PM. As has become the custom here, we have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us. This month's topic is Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), with an overview of gastrointestinal motility and the common problems many patients experience, ranging from chronic constipation to diarrhea. We will discuss things used to diagnose and treat these issues. If you are interested in calling in, the number is 707-923-3911.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. For this June 2021 episode, just for posterity, would you let people know your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was studying and working in humanities, literature, and painting at various schools. I decided to go back to graduate school in biology and physiology in 1968 and got my PhD at the University of Oregon in 1972. Since then, I have been writing about physiology and counseling individuals and doctors about hormones, physiology, and nutrition.

## SIBO, Serotonin, and Gut Health

**Andrew Murray:** I know there's a wealth of information on your website, RayPeat.com. Having been interested in the gut as the seat of good health—as the ancients always talked about digestion and assimilation being the seat of health—I wanted to go over what is known now. In the last five years, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) as a defined pathology.

I know you've mentioned serotonin as being a causative inflammatory mediator for many different pathologies. In the common media conception, most people think serotonin is a positive hormone, but actually, it's very inflammatory. I'd like your feedback on the pathogenesis and development of SIBO. Currently, they classify it as SIBO-C for constipation and SIBO-D for diarrhea. There is also a list of foods called the FODMAP guide. A lot of things people are told are healthy—especially the PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids), seeds, and nuts—appear on the FODMAP list.

What is your understanding of SIBO in patients complaining of diarrhea or constipation, and what is your approach to it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything can ferment if you aren't digesting it. Some people warn against FODMAPs because they ferment. Others promote exactly the same carbohydrates and oligosaccharides *because* they ferment and release short-chain fatty acids—acetate, butyrate, and propionate in particular. One doctrine says those are beneficial, stimulating things that prevent bowel cancer. Others point out that each one of those is a very serious potential toxin. We do absorb them. Acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid all have their potential value, but they are also well known as toxins.

Generally, I'm inclined to side with the people who prefer not to eat things that increase those potentially toxic short-chain fatty acids, because you can get all your nutrients with things that are resistant to fermentation. If you have normal digestive actions, sugars should be absorbed very high in the small intestine, shortly after leaving your stomach. In very healthy people, the stomach and the whole small intestine are sterile. The sicker a person is, the farther up the small intestine bacteria and other microbes can invade and set up housekeeping. Some people with very weak digestion will actually have fermentation going on in their stomach. If they eat sugar or carbohydrate, they can get drunk from alcohol production going on right in their stomach.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting. You said the small intestine should essentially be relatively sterile in comparison to the colon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Something like 15% or 20% of the population who are very healthy have a sterile small intestine. It tends to change with age as the metabolic rate slows down. The sicker a person is, the farther up in the small intestine you find bacteria living, closer and closer to the stomach.

**Andrew Murray:** So because of poor motility, increased transit time, aging, and decreased energy, the colonic bacteria have a chance to migrate upwards.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The digestive fluids and enzymes should discourage growth, if not directly kill yeast, bacteria, and parasites.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the classification of SIBO-C and SIBO-D: they talk about hydrogen-dominant bacteria associated with diarrhea and methane-dominant species associated with constipation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's mainly because methane is an anesthetic. It slows bowel contractions, slows down all biological processes, and decreases the metabolic rate. So it's natural that it should tend towards constipation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If 20% of people have a sterile intestine, what should the rest of us do? For the 80% of the population that doesn't have a sterile small intestine, what can we do to help keep the bacterial overgrowth down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Do you remember Dennis Burkitt? He studied diet effects and tumors in Africa. He popularized the high-fiber diet in the US, pointing out that the African on their typical diet has a 12-hour transit time, whereas the average American has a 72-hour transit time. Naturally, the very short duration doesn't give putrefaction or fermentation a chance to go very far.

The famous people who popularized yogurt to suppress putrefaction—like Metchnikoff and Bogomolets early in the 20th century—studied animals with short or long lifespans. They argued that animals with a short intestine, who eliminated quickly and didn't store putrefying material, were the long-lived animals. Those with a long intestine and long retention were shorter-lived.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw hypothyroidism as one of the predisposing factors to SIBO, along with chronic pancreatitis and motor disorders like Parkinson's disease and fibromyalgia. Parkinson's is interesting from a motor neuron perspective in terms of slowing muscular contraction along the GI tract.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the constipation leading to the neurological problem. Traditionally, they have thought of Parkinson's disease as a deficiency of dopamine. But dopamine and serotonin are an antagonistic pair. The evidence more strongly indicates that Parkinson's is related to a serotonin excess rather than just a dopamine deficiency. A few people have argued that serotonin can't get from your intestines to your brain, but there is evidence that if you have an undetoxified amount of serotonin in the bloodstream, it can get into the brain and shift the balance away from dopamine.

**Andrew Murray:** You've always said that the bulk of the serotonin produced is produced in the bowel, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct, 95% of it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We've been told for the last 30 years that serotonin is the "feel good" hormone. But scientists view serotonin as a major inflammatory compound. Why is serotonin so inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its natural function in the bowel is to cause contractions and secretion when the bowel is irritated. Irritation can be mechanical, chemical, or biological. The intestine knows it wants to get rid of something toxic, so it produces serotonin that causes intense contractions and secretions to wash the toxin out. But if you get chronic inflammation and irritation, you get a chronic, moderate excess of serotonin that can cause periodic cyclic diarrhea alternating with constipation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So everyone who has had car sickness can relate to the feeling of high serotonin—cramping intestines and nausea.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct. And one of the effects of serotonin is anxiety. That's now being recognized more than it being sleep-inducing. It can cause insomnia and anxiety.

## Diet, FODMAPs, and Milk

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the FODMAP criteria used by the medical industry, and the foods they say predispose people to these fermentable sugars...

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think avoidance of many of them is very reasonable. They recommend against beans, lentils, nuts, wheat, and rye. All of those things have other harmful effects as well as the fermentable carbohydrates.

**Andrew Murray:** But they also list milk. It's not all dairy, because they say butter and cheese are low in FODMAPs, but cow's milk is quoted as high. I work with a lot of people who are sure they are lactose intolerant. Milk is a food group you are a big advocate of. How do you feel about people who claim milk intolerance? Most papers suggest most people can drink a reasonable amount of milk.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there's a kind of cultish fear of milk that gets mixed up with the research. Even lactose-intolerant people can tolerate a moderate amount, especially if taken several times.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If they start with a small amount every day and increase it, they will start developing lactase over two to four weeks. But if they haven't been drinking milk, the body won't make enough lactase to digest a glass all of a sudden.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There were studies done on ethnic Chinese people in California, introducing milk to people who thought they were lactose intolerant. In a few weeks, taking maybe half a glass at a time, they were able to induce the enzymes. There's probably nothing in the body that isn't inducible given the appropriate circumstances.

**Andrew Murray:** For people who notice a definite change in bowel habits when drinking milk—implying pellet stools—what do you think is happening?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are several possibilities, including the pasture and the foods the cow gets. Sometimes they are very allergenic. If the cow is eating allergenic plants, the milk will trigger those allergies.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Especially if someone is gluten sensitive and the cow is fed wheat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. Same with breast milk. If the mother is eating a lot of allergenic foods, like peanuts, the baby will often get constipated.

## Diagnosis and Treatment Options

**Andrew Murray:** Looking at diagnostic techniques for people with chronic GI disturbance, what is your approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Checking their body temperature is a good first step. Hypometabolism—usually because of thyroid deficiency or nutrient deficiencies—lowers body temperature and makes tissues over-sensitive to irritation. Just by increasing your body temperature, getting enough easily absorbed glucose and fructose, the heat-producing effect can be enough to reduce inflammation and make your intestine go more smoothly.

**Andrew Murray:** Papers on SIBO agree on a microbiome that has been deranged, specifically looking at *Proteobacteria* and *Firmicutes*. In SIBO patients, there is a relative decrease in *Firmicutes* and an increase in *Proteobacteria*. Would you look at anything other than antibiotics? What about cascara or probiotics?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cascara accelerates the movement through the intestine as well as reducing inflammation and maintaining oxidative energy production. Completely indigestible fiber, specifically cellulose, can stimulate peristalsis and speed movement, reducing the chance for toxic fermentation. You also want to make sure you have nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, which are anti-inflammatory. Thyroid is anti-inflammatory.

One of the reasons I recommend orange juice and milk is that they are both good sources of flavonoids without the toxic irritants found in some flavonoid-rich foods like green vegetables. Orange juice is a very wide-spectrum anti-inflammatory and energy-producing food.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The premise of avoiding refined grains and starches is to reduce bacteria in the small intestine. That's why you also recommend antibacterial foods like grated raw carrot, bamboo shoots, well-cooked mushrooms, and oat bran to increase transit time and act as a natural, gentle antimicrobial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And aspirin sometimes is a big help to decrease bacterial activity.

## Caller: Diet Questions

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Caller:** I'm calling from Redwood, California. I eat primarily 70% vegetables, 20% dairy (cheese, yogurt), and I make homemade flax soda bread. The other 10% is salad dressings. I use stevia as a sweetener. I finish off the meal with Pau d'Arco tea. Is that good?

**Andrew Murray:** Everyone has different ideas about nutrition. Dr. Peat, you would recommend well-cooking the vegetables. From a herbal point of view, Pau d'Arco is well known as an anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent. Dr. Peat, what do you think about that breakdown?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure that stevia is safe in large quantities, but a small amount is probably okay. Regarding soda bread, does that mean it's a baking powder quick-rising bread? That tends to leave most of the gluten intact, but if it agrees with your intestine and doesn't cause inflammation, then your bowel health is pretty good. Cooked—very well cooked—vegetables are fine if a person doesn't have a problem with them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I'm not sure where your protein is coming from besides the dairy. Do you include eggs?

**Caller:** I eat a lot of eggs. That was included in the other 30% with the salad dressings and miscellaneous cheese.

## Probiotics, Antibiotics, and Herbal Remedies

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, to wrap up on SIBO treatment: There is a particular antibiotic used that gets good success. Do you think probiotics are positive for recolonizing and safely changing the flora?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are several bacteria and some fungus that produce antibiotics themselves. They are a combination of probiotic and antibiotic. They kill off harmful bacteria by the antibiotics they produce. But you can usually tell within a few hours if an antibiotic supplement is going to help your digestive symptoms.

I think there's too much rigmarole in the diagnosis. Many people have forgotten that by tapping your abdomen in different places, you can identify whether you have a fluid accumulation or just gas. If you are getting gas throughout your small intestine, that will make your whole belly resound like a watermelon.

**Andrew Murray:** Just to confirm, gas production is a problem, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No good comes from it. In fact, too much methane has those stasis-producing effects leading to constipation. Finding methane in your breath doesn't prove you have methane-producing bacteria, because our own mitochondria, when under stress (like from drinking too much alcohol), produce considerable amounts of methane. Any stress can lead to methane appearing in our secretions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you mentioned fungi that act as a probiotic and antibiotic, are you referring to species like *Saccharomyces boulardii*?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the only one I know of.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about garlic and allicin extracts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those hot compounds can be harmful to your stomach and intestine if you eat large amounts. They do kill bacteria, but they can also kill your digestive system's epithelial cells.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think the highest rate of stomach cancer in the world is in Bhutan, where the diet consists of a lot of chili peppers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, Central America has a lot of stomach cancer associated with that.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to mention *Berberis vulgaris* (Barberry) and Goldenseal (*Hydrastis*), which contain berberine. Papers suggest berberine is very useful in treating SIBO.

## COVID-19, mRNA, and Transhumanism

**Andrew Murray:** Let's open up the topic to COVID-19 and the coming transhumanism. We see people like Elon Musk talking about implantable chips and neurobiology. Part and parcel of the COVID-19 debate lies in the technology used to produce this experimental drug—the mRNA vaccine. The mRNA platform is being scaled up quickly. Yet, the platform is accused of giving us over to genetic changes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been looking for the actual scientific rationale for shifting from traditional vaccines—killed or inactivated bacteria or viruses—to a nucleic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** They want to say it saves time, don't they?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there has been any clear scientific explanation for why they did it. You can shortcut traditional methods, but what they did was skip ordinary animal and safety testing. When you look at the individuals behind these companies, you see that years ago they were talking about genetic engineering. In justifying the RNA vaccines, they describe them as changing our "genetic operating system," treating us like a computer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we are becoming the genetically modified organism.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When Tony Fauci heard the suggestions that RNA can be copied back—reverse transcribed—into our DNA, he said that doesn't happen. He indicated total ignorance of 50 years of nucleic acid research showing that everyone contains reverse transcriptase. Whenever a foreign type of RNA enters a cell, it is able to be transcribed into DNA. That DNA can become a perpetual, inherited part of the cell.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they might tell you it's not permanent, but 50 years of research has shown these changes can become permanent.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And there have been demonstrations that our exosome system—which is designed to communicate proteins and genetic information between cells—has been demonstrated to be open to receiving foreign DNA and RNA and packaging it in exosomes. Our own mechanism becomes like a virus factory, copying and spreading the foreign DNA.

**Andrew Murray:** This is exactly what Tal Zaks, the former CEO of Moderna, was quoted as saying in 2017: that this platform is the future. When questioned about genomic changes, he said the same thing as Fauci—that it's not possible.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He's actually an oncologist. He was proposing genetic engineering as cancer treatment. Years ago, I think Biden was the figurehead for the "Cancer Moonshot," which was based on genetic engineering on an individual basis to change the genes of your cancer.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We've discussed since March that mortality was actually very low and that there were optional treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. This leads me to think about the *Codex Alimentarius* and the World Economic Forum. I think, as you mentioned Dr. Peat, the next two to five years will bear out the consequences.

Thank you so much for joining us. It's three minutes to the hour.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** More can be found about Dr. Peat at his website, www.RayPeat.com. You can find many reference articles there. He has been working in this field of alternative science for over 30 years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you for listening this evening.

**Andrew Murray:** Our website is westernbotanicalmedicine.com. Until the third Friday of next month, when we will pick up on this transhumanism subject. Good night.
