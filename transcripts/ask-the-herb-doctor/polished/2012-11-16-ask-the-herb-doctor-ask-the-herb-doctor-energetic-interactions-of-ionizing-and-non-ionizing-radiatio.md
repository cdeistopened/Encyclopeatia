## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

Tonight, you are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject: the energetic interactions of ionizing and non-ionizing radiations. We are very pleased to welcome Dr. Ray Peat to the show to share his knowledge on the subject and to offer alternative strategies for maintaining good health.

By the term "non-ionizing radiation," we mean the type of radiation that doesn't carry enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules—that is, to remove an electron from them. Ionizing radiation has sufficiently high energy to remove electrons and damage DNA. However, even non-ionizing types are certainly under question.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you give us some examples of non-ionizing and ionizing radiation?

**Andrew Murray:** The non-ionizing types would be things like radio waves and microwaves, up to the infrared. The ionizing types would be ultraviolet radiation from the sun, X-rays, and gamma rays. Those are the ones that really damage DNA. However, non-ionizing radiation, while it doesn't damage DNA *per se*, definitely has excitatory effects that can be very damaging.

A recent article published in *Science Daily* on November 13, 2012, reports that even low-level radioactivity is damaging and the very lowest levels of radiation are harmful to life. Scientists at the Cambridge Philosophical Society's journal, *Biological Reviews*, reported results of a wide-ranging analysis of 46 peer-reviewed studies published over the past 40 years. Researchers found that variation in low-level natural background radiation had small but highly statistically significant negative effects on DNA as well as several other measures of health. So, no levels of radiation are safe.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I've heard plenty of doctors tell me directly that you can withstand a certain amount of radiation and it's perfectly harmless, like a certain number of chest X-rays or dental X-rays per year. But John Gofman disproved that already. Now more research is coming out saying that no level is safe; there is no threshold beneath which there is no negative effect.

**Andrew Murray:** The accepted safety levels have continually come down from post-war units to the present date, but obviously, there are still measurable differences in exposure.

## Dr. Peat’s Background and History of Radiation Safety

**Andrew Murray:** We are very happy to have you with us, Dr. Peat. I’m sure our listeners would benefit from hearing your academic background regarding what we're going to be talking about tonight.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From 1968 to 1972, I studied biology, reproductive physiology, and biochemistry at the University of Oregon for my PhD. My first teaching job was in 1959-1960, and the main course was called "Physics for Biology Majors." The main content had to do with the interactions of radiant energy with matter. It covered photosynthesis, nuclear fallout, sunburn, and so on.

Before that, I had been following the government doctrines about the safety of fallout from atomic bomb tests. Around the same time, the government found that in the Navy, people were being injured or killed by working around radars. That got me interested in the effects of microwave radar frequencies. They found that if the wavelength was similar to the diameter of the person's head, they could be very quickly killed as their brain overheated. In experiments, they found that the same frequency wouldn't kill animals with a small brain at the same level of exposure because it was a matter of resonance with the size of the animal's head or organ.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is the excitation that the non-ionizing form of radiation produces?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The U.S. government policy was based largely on the work of Herman Schwan, who was brought over from Nazi Germany to work for the government explaining the safety of microwave and radar waves. He knew that the brain could be cooked by overexposure. Technicians would sometimes heat up their hot dogs by putting them in front of the radar antenna.

Schwan was a physicist, not a biologist. He argued that the only danger from radar or microwaves was if it heated you up. He found that to heat up a beaker of salt water noticeably, it required sitting in front of the radar for at least an hour at an intensity of around 100,000 microwatts per square centimeter. Just to be safe, the government set the safety limit at 10,000 microwatts per square centimeter.

Meanwhile, the Soviets had technicians getting sick working around radar. They did experiments and determined that only 10 microwatts should be allowed for technicians, and only 1 microwatt per square centimeter for general public exposure.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's a big difference from 10,000 based on the beaker water experiment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The government knew about the dangers of microwave radiation just as well as they knew about the dangers of radioactive fallout. But over the decades, they would fire employees who exposed the dangers of microwaves. Until about 20 years ago, that same 10,000-microwatt standard was recognized. Now it's down to about 1,000 microwatts.

## Low-Level Radiation and Biological Resonance

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding that recent article stating that even the very lowest levels of radiation were harmful to life, what do you have to say about non-ionizing sources?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There is good evidence that the lower limits of interference with life are produced at much lower power levels than anything people are now worried about. For example, one study found that brain electrical activity could resonate with a field—if it was tuned properly—with an energy of only one billionth of a microwatt.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow. So even at that level, there was an interaction.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, something is happening. In animal experiments, they know they can interfere with the orientation of bees and homing pigeons. Pigeons get lost if you put a magnet on them because they use electromagnetic fields to guide themselves when the sun is obscured. Salamanders are about a hundred times more sensitive to the fields than snails.

There were many studies through the 50s and 60s on the ability of organisms to sense these extremely weak environmental fields. For example, human studies done by the CIA found that if you shield a person from the Earth's resonant, very small electromagnetic activity, the brain waves become disorganized. Normal alpha rhythms and similar brain oscillations in the 7 to 12 cycle frequencies get their cue from the Earth's resonance of the same frequency.

**Andrew Murray:** When they talk about Beta and Theta waves—I think Theta is about 12 cycles per second, associated with thought and focus, while Beta is sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you drive the brain with a signal larger than the Earth's resonant frequency, you can cause the brain to adjust its cycling. Or, if you simply put a person in a cave isolated from the Earth with metal shielding, all of their systems become desynchronized. Normally, each organ and system coordinates with the others. When you interfere with it, the whole body loses its coordination. Monthly cycles get out of phase with daily cycles. This can affect menstruation, fertility, mental clarity, and cause insomnia.

Michael Persinger, in a video called *No More Secrets*, mentions that rare experiences like extrasensory perception are tending to disappear from society. He thinks it's because of the pollution. While the oscillation of our nerve cells is at the same level of energy as the natural oscillations of the Earth's magnetic field, the pollution is thousands or millions of times more intense. The body is being influenced by this "junk" coming in at all kinds of frequencies.

## Household Appliances and Health Risks

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned the Earth's natural magnetic field. Did you say it was six cycles a second?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are various parts of it. One important one is 10 or 11; another is 6 or 7.

**Andrew Murray:** Am I right in thinking that most power transmission stations run power at the same kind of frequency?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, standard house current is 60 cycles per second. 60 is close enough to our common oscillations that it can have a very big effect. In Europe, it's 50 cycles. Those are known to affect the rate of cell division and the rate of developing blood vessels. If used in the right context, you can stimulate the growth of a broken bone. But if it's happening at random, it is known to increase the incidence of cancer and other biological disorganization.

For example, Alzheimer's disease and ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) are connected with the electromagnetic energy workers are exposed to. The incidence of Alzheimer's is three times higher among people who work with machinery like industrial sewing machines.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is that because of the motor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The rhythm is governed by the speed of the motor, producing rhythms on the order of our own native rhythm—from a few per second up to maybe 100 per second.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What other common household appliances have shown a negative interaction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You probably remember the issue with electric blankets causing cancer about 10 or 15 years ago. Even electric clocks—having one near your head while you sleep is probably harmful. One of the strongest things around the house is the fluorescent tube or compact fluorescent bulb (CFL).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Laptops are another danger on the EMF reader. What about electric shavers?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Electric shavers are connected with brain tumors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it has to do with how close it gets to your head?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. About 40 years ago, at a big electronic company, a few people in a lab were working with a dynamo that had a pulsating magnetic field. Within just a few months of each other, two of these employees died from an astrocytoma, a very uncommon brain tumor.

**Andrew Murray:** Going back to leukemia, the incidence is statistically significant in children born localized around high-tension power lines.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any kind of power line is a risk, but especially within 100 meters of the very powerful ones. Radio and television broadcasting towers are also major dangers; within half a mile, you can get into toxic field strength.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If someone lives near a broadcast tower or power line, what would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would have a metal roof and probably some metal screens connecting the roof to well-grounded plumbing.

## The "Bag of Chemicals" vs. Bio-Electronics

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding the negative health effects of electromagnetic radiation, you mentioned earlier that government policy is based on heating water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The basis for the policy since the 1947-50 study is the image of the organism as a bag of chemicals in a salty water solution. This is an absolutely unfounded model of what an organism is. It’s a horrible fantasy that leads corporate and government people to say, "Oh, there's no danger, you're just a bag of chemicals."

Albert Szent-Györgyi was one of the early people recognizing that life is an electronic process. Alexander Gurwitsch, even 20 or 30 years before Szent-Györgyi, demonstrated that cells communicate through light—in his experiments, it was the ultraviolet region. Szent-Györgyi emphasized that resonant electrons can travel through the organism. This opens up the possibility for resonant interactions between other frequencies—not just high-energy rays, but very low-energy rays which can resonate with groups of electrons behaving like an antenna.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So we are like an electrical piece of equipment.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the late 1940s, two Romanians were the first to show coherent electronic interaction producing microwaves. They basically invented the maser (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). Just last summer, scientists found they could make a maser that operates at room temperature. So now the physical, non-reductionist approach is established: masers do exist and can work at room temperature. We can now say Szent-Györgyi was describing the physics of a maser operating in the organism.

## Caller Questions: Lighting and Microwaves

**Caller 1:** I have a few questions. First, you said fluorescent lights were dangerous. Are the squiggly ones (CFLs) bad for the nervous system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they are bad for the nervous system especially because they emit in the radio and microwave frequencies.

**Caller 1:** They are uncomfortable to me. Is it better to stick with incandescent bulbs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think they are still the best answer. LEDs maybe.

**Caller 1:** My daughter has computers and machines with LED lights that stay on. Are those harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think the light itself is especially harmful, but there is probably activity in the computer even when it's asleep.

**Caller 1:** What about microwave ovens? Are they dangerous to use, and is the food bad for you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The microwave is now pretty well shielded. In 1973, the Consumers Union recommended buying no microwave oven, but now if you don't stand near them and just use them for a couple of minutes, they aren't the worst problem.

**Caller 1:** Does it destroy the nutrients in the food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it's basically like boiling the food. It does heat damage, but nothing much worse.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Another reason fluorescent tubes are bad is that they don't emit a lot of red light, which is what incandescents do.

## Caller Questions: Hypersensitivity and Conspiracy

**Caller 2:** I am a long-term person with electromagnetic hypersensitivity. I have to say that microwave ovens are not safe; I have to stand 6 to 10 feet away to avoid pressure in my head. The process impacts the textural quality of the electromagnetic bonds in the food. There is no safe level of radiation. Do you have any solutions for people like me who are "mine canaries"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Scandinavian countries, they are taking ultra-sensitivity to electromagnetism seriously. They are insulating or grounding schools to protect students who react to it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Are they doing that with metal roofs and grounded plumbing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and even special paint that has a shielding effect.

**Caller 3:** I watched a documentary called *The Light Bulb Conspiracy* about the energy cartel controlling product lifespan. I get tension headaches from CFLs. I also wanted to ask about directed energy weapons and the HAARP project bouncing frequencies off the ionosphere.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for your call. Dr. Peat, let's focus on positive things people can do to help themselves.

## Protective Physiology and Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** You've written articles about testosterone and progesterone being very proactive and anti-inflammatory regarding EMF and free radical damage.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Their deficiency is involved in all degenerative diseases—heart disease, sudden death, Alzheimer's. Men with Alzheimer's have high estrogen and low testosterone. All kinds of injury, whether ionizing radiation or electromagnetic waves, lower testosterone and progesterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And they all cause the cells to increase estrogen and serotonin, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It's not surprising that non-ionizing radiation causes the same diseases as ionizing radiation because they are all affecting the same basic physiology: lowering our protective hormones.

One type of radiation I didn't mention is what they are using now in airport scanners. The ones that aren't X-rays use millimeter wavelengths. Decades ago, the Russians studied the biological effects of these wavelengths and found they are especially important in cell communication. The TSA says it's harmless, but the energy levels they use are about 10 to 100 times higher than what Russian studies showed are involved in cell control.

## Practical Solutions and Diet

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about things in our home? We can turn off wireless and use ethernet cords. We can hold cell phones away from our heads. Any other recommendations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Using the simplest, old-fashioned technologies like wires is very important rather than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Even Bluetooth emits enough to add to biological confusion.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even the wired earpiece brings some EMF to the brain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In fact, any metal in the environment is a potential source of re-radiated energy. When I was experimenting with biological detectors, I hooked a detector to my finger and got a radio station coming out of my body. I was resonating so strongly I couldn't pick up the energy I was trying to detect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can you mention some foods that are EMF protective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Things rich in magnesium help to stabilize cells. Stress causes cells to take up calcium, which displaces magnesium. A magnesium-rich, phosphate-poor diet helps. Avoiding polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) lowers stress and supports the testosterone, progesterone, and thyroid systems. Caffeine is helpful to the extent that it increases progesterone, testosterone, and thyroid, helping with radiation resistance.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In the herbal world, nettle tea and raspberry leaf tea are rich in minerals. Green leaves like kale, chard, and collards are magnesium-rich. Phosphate-poor foods would be milk and cheese.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And again, the greens.
