## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. This month’s topic covers postpartum depression, steroid hormones, and new drugs with dangerous consequences. As always, Dr. Raymond Peat is here to bring his science-based wisdom to these subjects. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** Your latest newsletter on postpartum depression, brain aging, and reductionism continues to discuss the shortsightedness of science and its link to aging and diseases like obesity, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. For those who haven't heard the show before, could you outline your academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After teaching a variety of subjects, including linguistics and literature, I decided to go to graduate school in biology. I got my PhD in 1972 and have been continuing to study mostly physiology, stress, and aging since then.

## Postpartum Depression and the Drug Industry

**Andrew Murray:** I want to talk about a product that was just given FDA approval called Zulresso, also known as brexanolone or allopregnanolone. As we’ve mentioned in the past, this is a naturally occurring metabolite of naturally produced progesterone. However, it has been approved as an injection given over a 60-hour infusion in a hospital to treat postpartum depression, costing $34,000. Why not simply use a $30 bottle of progesterone or pregnenolone, both of which quickly convert in the body to allopregnanolone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it was a natural therapy, it would be cheap and not patented, and no one would make several billion dollars a year from selling it. For the last 10 or 15 years, the FDA has acted as though it is in the business of creating monopolies. They did it with the sedative drug Oxybate several years ago; it went from costing a few dollars for a bottle to thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.

**Andrew Murray:** Because it’s been patented and the company has been allowed to use this as their standard.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right. After that, they declared that quinine was a "new drug" and assigned a new drug approval to one company. Since the FDA depends on fees to approve drugs, a large part of their existence sees the money coming in from the drug companies as sustaining their existence. If a doctor wants to use quinine bark or a natural nutritional substance for therapy, and it happens to compete with one of these new drug assignments, the doctor is effectively attempting to break a monopoly. In some situations, doctors are actually losing their licenses for using traditional medical reasoning and avoiding so-called "evidence-based medicine."

**Andrew Murray:** "Evidence-based medicine" has become a very popular phrase recently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What they mean by "evidence" is a study that costs maybe $150 million. Not just any researcher has that money to test a nutrient or hormone. So, what constitutes good evidence in this monopoly paradigm is a study that no one but the giant corporations can afford. Consequently, the only drugs that have legal approval by the FDA are monopoly drugs. State licensing boards are putting pressure on doctors to conform and follow guidelines. It is getting ridiculous; they are telling doctors not to consider any of the traditional signs of hypothyroidism, but to go only by the TSH—ignoring 200 years of recognized metabolic and functional signs.

**Andrew Murray:** It’s a kind of communism, where there is only one way.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it's strictly monopoly capitalism.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Maybe totalitarianism.

**Andrew Murray:** Right, very dictatorial. You’ve mentioned that doctors can no longer use reasoning. This evidence-based medicine paradigm seems to prohibit and punish reasoning, which is very dangerous.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the newsletter, I mentioned the movement to abolish the so-called basic science part of medical education—the first two years where they actually study science. One proponent has written articles pointing out that there have been over 350 reversals of traditional medicine by these big corporate studies. He seems like a progressive person wanting truth in science, but he says these big studies are the evidence we must take into account. He argues we only need guidelines on how to use these approved treatments. If we have guidelines for all diseases, everyone will treat the disease in the same way, becoming blind to individual variations and unique histories. It's trying to reduce and abstract medicine to the point that no brain is necessary, only following guidelines.

**Andrew Murray:** If A plus B equals C, go to D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If that's the case, they don't need the first two years of medical school. But even the sciences themselves—physiology, neurology, endocrinology—have been powerfully invaded by the drug companies over the last hundred years. Their understanding has been shaped by the reductionist ideal that one sickness can be defined for everyone and treated with a specific drug.

## Allopregnanolone vs. Progesterone

**Andrew Murray:** Returning to allopregnanolone, the new patented drug. Why couldn't you just use pregnenolone or progesterone as a precursor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Someone tested that and found that just a tiny dose of oral progesterone—20 milligrams—tripled the amount of allopregnanolone in the body.

**Andrew Murray:** So there is no reason not to use oral progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another point is that allopregnanolone is essentially the end of a line of metabolites starting with cholesterol. Those are regulated at many steps before they come into existence. When you give the end product without looking at the condition of all the preceding steps, that is a great opportunity for throwing the whole system out of balance. For example, estrogen and aldosterone are other end products of steroid metabolism, and excess of those is very dangerous. I don't know if that will turn out to be true for using simple allopregnanolone without its precursors, but it is something they haven't examined.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw a 2006 study from Sweden noting that allopregnanolone was biphasic—at certain doses it was excitatory, and at others, it was calming. This reminds me of valerian, which acts on GABA receptors; usually, it calms people, but a small subset gets stimulated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's the sort of thing you risk when using an end-of-line metabolite. Normally, it can never get above a certain level because it has to go through stages where each precursor produces a smaller amount of product. If you artificially give an amount that the body could never experience on its own, you might anesthetize some of the regulatory inhibitory nerves and release things that are less sensitive to inhibition. You are risking something the organism has never experienced before.

## Causes and Treatments for Postpartum Depression

**Andrew Murray:** What is your understanding of the cause of postpartum depression, and how can it be avoided?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It happens in women with a history of stress, difficult pregnancy, or difficult birth. Even if the birth was routine, there may have been a history of stress earlier in life. The burden of pregnancy and birth, building the baby's body and brain, requires resources. If you don't have enough calcium in your diet, you increase parathyroid hormone and take calcium from your bones to build the baby's bones. The baby gets priority over some nutrients. Even in an apparently healthy woman, pregnancy increases the risk of nutritional deficiency. Women who suffer postpartum depression typically have a history of preceding stress.

**Andrew Murray:** Is there a relation to menstrual disorders?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. I think PMS is closely related to postpartum issues.

**Andrew Murray:** If we posit that exposure to high levels of estrogen is responsible for the shrinkage in gray matter—"baby brain"—why isn't progesterone supplementation recommended to speed up recovery? What would be a reasonable amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In healthy women, progesterone levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma increase considerably during the time the brain is being repaired after birth. However, cholesterol is the precursor for making progesterone. Women with postpartum depression typically have reduced levels of cholesterol, so they cannot make enough progesterone. Vitamin A and thyroid are other limiting factors. A normal cycling woman produces about 30 milligrams of progesterone daily in the luteal phase. I think that would be a reasonable therapeutic amount postpartum. However, if she is still under stress and not eliminating estrogen well, it might take larger amounts.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you suggest increasing cholesterol levels to enable hormone manufacture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having enough carbohydrate and sugar in the diet is very important.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there is a subset of women who, despite the massive rise of progesterone during pregnancy, are still estrogen dominant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure, especially if they had a history of PMS or biological stress. Most often it's associated with slightly low thyroid function. About 50 years ago, I saw a chart based on a large number of pregnancies showing a steady increase of progesterone to a level 50 times higher than estrogen. If your background estrogen stays high because of low thyroid, low B vitamins, or low protein, it is impossible to produce enough progesterone to offset that falsely high amount of estrogen. No amount of progesterone increase will make that pregnancy healthy; it requires getting the estrogen under control with nutrition and thyroid function.

## Caller Q&A: Exercise and Physiology

**Caller (New York):** I’ve read that as long as you aren't running a marathon—say, doing sprints for 20 minutes—it actually increases CO2. Do you agree?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends entirely on your physiology, especially your thyroid function. A person with borderline hypothyroidism will start producing lactic acid with the slightest exertion, which displaces carbon dioxide. If you are in great condition, you can keep your carbon dioxide level up and not produce lactic acid with a moderate amount of exercise.

**Caller (New York):** So for a healthy person, it could be positive, but for an unhealthy person, it adds to their problems?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When lactic acid goes up because you aren't using oxygen properly, you release histamine, which produces soreness and potentially asthma. Histamine causes blood pressure to drop. With greater exercise, you release serotonin from mast cells, which could cause a blood pressure spike—that is much worse than the histamine effect.

**Caller (New York):** If people over 50 are predominantly hypothyroid, what should they do? I’ve heard taking Vitamin E or baking soda before exercise is protective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a lot of athletes are starting to use baking soda before stressful exertion to provide extra sodium, bicarbonate, and CO2.

**Caller (New York):** What about Cat's Claw (*Uncaria tomentosa*)? It supposedly repairs DNA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've never studied that.

**Caller (New York):** Regarding Vitamin K—is it necessary to take MK-4 specifically, or are other forms okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you eat animal liver, you get the whole variety. The liver can convert K1 or K2 to the higher chains. I think K1 or K2 is adequate because our liver can make the others.

**Caller (New York):** If someone has low thyroid and active adrenals (high cortisol), is it conceivable they might create crises in their life to maintain that cortisol cycle?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 60s, that was a common idea among psychologists. I've known people who seem to typify that condition—they know how to create excitement and turmoil. When they get their thyroid function up, people who had been creating turmoil just sit around, enjoy life, and smile.

## Gestational Diabetes and Nutrition

**Andrew Murray:** Apart from progesterone, what can be done for gestational diabetes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It isn't just a matter of thyroid and adrenals; all hormones are involved in the energy process. Sodium and calcium are important in pregnancy not just for blood volume and bones, but for avoiding adrenal stress hormone excess. People with a history of stress have an increased requirement for sodium, calcium, and Vitamin D.

## Vitamin A Toxicity Myths

**Andrew Murray:** A listener asked about a website claiming chronic Vitamin A toxicity is the cause of autoimmune diseases. What is your view?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin A is used to make all steroid hormones from cholesterol. Thyroid and Vitamin A travel together on a protein in the blood and are taken up by cells together. You don't produce steroid hormones without Vitamin A. It is used in protein synthesis; hair and skin will fail if you are deficient. Mucous membranes stop producing mucus without it. I looked through the book claiming toxicity and couldn't find any facts.

**Andrew Murray:** What about the famous polar bear liver toxicity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has been cited in textbooks for 80 years as proof Vitamin A is toxic. But polar bears sometimes eat fish poisoned by algae, and their livers store that toxin. The explorers likely got algae toxin via the bear liver. When drug companies were releasing Retin-A, there were sudden news releases about Vitamin A causing blindness. I tried to verify one report at the University of Oregon and couldn't get any confirmation. I think they were made up to create a desire for synthetic Vitamin A.

## Caller Q&A: Pickle Juice and Lupus

**Caller (Texas):** Athletes are using pickle juice for cramps and hangovers. Do you know what’s in it that helps?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I imagine it would contain lactic acid (if traditionally made) and salt. Anything salty in the morning can be very settling. It helps regulate blood sugar and lower stress hormones.

**Andrew Murray:** I had an email question about Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). What is your approach to this autoimmune disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Like other autoimmune diseases, it is much more common in women. Animal models can be created with estrogen excess. Estrogen activates inflammatory processes. Women who believed they needed kidney transplants found they had no more symptoms when they took progesterone and thyroid. It can definitely be seen as an estrogen excess symptom.

## Caller Q&A: Glyphosate and Green Vegetables

**Caller (Jersey):** A professor from MIT suggests glyphosate might displace glycine in the body because the molecules are similar. What do you think?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is very toxic at such extremely small amounts that interfering with glycine wouldn't do much at that level. The mechanism is more likely related to DNA regulation interference.

**Caller (Jersey):** Regarding green vegetables—I know you say to boil them to reduce PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids). Is steaming the same?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you boil them, you can skim off any fat that rises to the surface. It is an advantage to be able to pour off the fat.

**Caller (Jersey):** But you lose minerals in the water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, a lot of the important magnesium and calcium goes into the water.

**Caller (Jersey):** So, because the PUFA remains in the leaf or you lose minerals in the water, that’s one of the reasons you don't recommend eating green vegetables?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. A lot of the PUFA remains tied to the proteins of the leaf. When you eat it, your bile salts will cause you to absorb most of that PUFA.

## New Libido Drugs

**Andrew Murray:** A new drug called Vyleesi, based on melanocortin, was approved for female libido. Do you know anything about it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Melanocortin is the precursor protein for making beta-lipoprotein, endorphins, and ACTH—things that come up during the stress reaction. If you take one of these end products out of context, you have unpredictable effects. Suppression of appetite is associated with those receptors. If a woman lacks desire, there are likely serious metabolic problems. DHEA is a great activator of libido, but it goes down under stress when cortisol rises. You should concentrate on lowering stress and using pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, or thyroid.

**Andrew Murray:** And DHEA should be used with adequate thyroid to prevent conversion to estrogen, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.
