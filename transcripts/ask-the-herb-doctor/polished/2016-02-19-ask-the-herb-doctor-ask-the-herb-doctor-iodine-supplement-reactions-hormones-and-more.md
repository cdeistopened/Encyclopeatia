## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us to share his wisdom. He explains things that are almost certainly not what we would hear in the mainstream, but are nonetheless very well researched. Dr. Peat, for people who perhaps have never heard you or listened to the show, would you give us your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After getting a master's degree in humanities at the University of Oregon, I came back in 1968 through 1972 for a biology PhD, concentrating on reproductive physiology. The hormones involved in reproduction are involved in everything relating to life, and brain development was one of my secondary themes of research.

## Iodine Supplementation and "Nascent" Iodine

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to get into the subject of iodine. I've heard people touting a product called "nascent iodine." They claim it is a stable ionic form that is more readily taken up by the thyroid gland. However, I’ve also read that nascent iodine is very reactive. Given that iodized salt and seafood are available, do we really need supplementation? Is this product necessary?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1980s, I looked into the iodine nutrition question because I saw women with breast disease who recovered quickly when they took supplements of kelp or thyroid hormone. The safest thing is to correct the thyroid problem directly rather than counting on big doses of iodine. Large doses over many years can be problematic. For example, there are about 70 or more publications looking at iodine intake around the world over a period of decades. They see that over half a milligram, or especially over one milligram of iodine per day, is closely connected with increased risk of thyroiditis and thyroid cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** Wow.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the theories of why that happens is that iodine spontaneously reacts—or in the presence of white blood cells, their enzymes can cause iodine to react—with fatty acids that are unsaturated. If you've heard about the "iodine number" to describe the degree of unsaturation of a fat, the food oils that are highly unsaturated have a high iodine number. That means the number of molecules of iodine that will be spontaneously absorbed by the oil. The iodine attacks the double bonds in the fat where they lack hydrogen saturation. The iodine fills in to become an analog to the saturated hydrogen content.

There is this tendency of unsaturated fats to react with iodine. When that happens, the body can interpret that as a signal to the thyroid gland, possibly imitating the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it doesn't cause an increase of thyroid hormone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Perhaps it can fill the site where TSH should be acting and interfere with that. It probably can go either way, forcing too much activity or, more likely, blocking the effect of TSH. The polyunsaturated fats by themselves interfere with the enzyme which releases thyroid hormone from the gland. So too much of the unsaturated fats, with or without iodine, will have an anti-thyroid effect. But potentially, the iodine reaction could cause overstimulation by mimicking TSH.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned the iodine binding to the double bonds producing this product, and that in its own right could stimulate inflammatory thyroiditis or cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that's why high iodine intake is statistically associated with greater risk of thyroid cancer. If there really were a product that contained a "more reactive" form of iodine, that would just mean it would attack more molecules. I looked up the source of that nascent iodine product. A man in Texas filed a patent about 10 years ago that is just completely goofy. If you look at the diagram, it shows things that just can't happen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So iodine supplementation is very risky. Basically, you should get your trace minerals from seafood sources rather than isolated iodine supplements, and especially not in combination with vegetable polyunsaturated oils.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think that's true.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the chemistry of "nascent" iodine, the media spin was that because it didn't have a stable octet, it was more suitable for the thyroid. But wouldn't that reactivity be counterproductive? Wouldn't it react with the first thing it touched upon ingestion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yes. The whole idea of a newly born or "nascent" molecule comes from chemistry. When I was in school, they talked about nascent oxygen, which is highly reactive for a few seconds after it's formed. That's because the electrons are in an excited state. That electronic excitation passes quickly. In short-term situations of a few seconds, that excited state can make a molecule useful for certain reactions, but it isn't something you'd want to put in your body.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's basically a more dangerous form of iodine that can cause a free radical reaction?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's what they're talking about, but I don't think it even exists in the product.

## Soy, Isoflavones, and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** I was looking at some abstracts regarding isoflavones. Soy and isoflavones were touted as being healthy, but these abstracts mentioned an alcohol-soluble fraction shown to cause female cancers. They suggest these things are taken up by the thyroid or inhibit the uptake of iodide, increasing estradiol. What do you think about the industry push for soy infant formula?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it has seriously harmed lots of kids, partly through the estrogenic effect. The oil itself has a pro-estrogen, anti-thyroid effect. Apart from the isoflavones, the category of flavonoids is very similar. The phenyl group or benzene group is located slightly closer to the keto oxygen in the isoflavones, and that group seems to be the estrogenic group. The other orientation of the benzene group makes it more likely to be anti-estrogenic. Lots of fruits and vegetables contain the anti-estrogenic forms.

**Andrew Murray:** And of course, it's a hugely cultivated GMO product.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Don't all legumes have a certain percentage of these isoflavones? Is soy just particularly high?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main problem with soy, besides it being basically inedible, is that it's almost all grown in the genetically modified form that takes large amounts of toxic pesticides, which are estrogenic too.

**Andrew Murray:** It's important to make the male listeners aware that guys have estrogen too. Soy consumption in males has been associated with gynecomastia. Drinking alcohol excessively can also produce that symptom of male breasts.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I was a kid, just before the Second World War, we knew some very poor immigrants to California. There was one couple in which the wife got a job, but the father could nurse the baby because his estrogen had become so high from malnutrition. At the end of the Second World War, when soldiers got out of the prison camps, lots of them had breasts from the effects of prolonged starvation.

**Andrew Murray:** We're talking lactation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, in the case of this man in California, the wife said, "Pa's milk ain't got much strength." But yes, they can lactate, especially if they have a baby nursing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the high estrogen stimulated their prolactin, and then with the suckling, it produced milk. That is incredible.

**Andrew Murray:** It begs the question of why soy could exist as a product for so long when it's essentially a waste product. It's dangerous in terms of its estrogenic and pro-inflammatory effects.

## Estrogen Levels: Men vs. Women

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, how would you compare estrogen levels in menopausal women versus men?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With aging, a man's estrogen pretty steadily increases. If he has a heart attack or traumatic injury, it goes up sharply during recovery. But generally, there's an upward trend.

In women, when the ovaries stop cycling, they stop producing progesterone suddenly, but they continue producing a considerable amount of estrogen until the body can adjust. So there are a few years in the 40s or early 50s when estrogen is extremely excessive relative to progesterone. After the ovaries have stopped functioning, the rest of the body begins producing estrogen, similar to how it happens in men. The fatter a woman is, the more estrogen she produces because fat tissue is a good source of it. Any tissue, to the degree that it's stressed, will begin producing estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So is the level about the same between men and women?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Women tend to be fatter in old age, so they are more likely to have a higher level. However, just measuring blood estrogen gives a misleading impression. When progesterone is deficient, the estrogen receptor isn't destroyed, so it stays in the cell binding estrogen. Enzymes that are no longer inactivated by progesterone capture circulating estrogen and deposit it in cells. Other enzymes shift estrogen to the estriol form, which is the most active. So, tissues load up with estrogenic stimulation even though it isn't being released to be measured in the blood.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the blood test could appear fine, but it could be stored in fat and other tissues. If menopausal women lose weight, do they poison themselves with estrogen as it comes out of the cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just temporarily. It's better to get rid of it than have it local, because inside the cells it produces cancer of the breast, lung, uterus, ovary, kidney, brain, and intestine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about women who continue to menstruate? I heard of a woman who was 70 and still menstruating.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I talked to a gynecologist who was giving his wife progesterone and she was still menstruating at 60. If you have a very good system for producing progesterone, there's no reason why it should stop at 55.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you think it would be beneficial for women to continue to menstruate until they die?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Flamingos have no life limitation according to ordinary mortality curves. They seem to only die by accident.

## Progesterone vs. Estrogen Receptors

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned that progesterone destroys the estrogen receptor. Does estrogen do the same thing to progesterone receptors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen activates its own receptor in most tissues and activates inflammatory things which tend to turn off the progesterone receptor if you have an excess. Generally, the normal function would be for progesterone to rise as soon as the estrogen has had its surge and then knock it out. Estrogen is fine if it's active only for 12 to 24 hours every month.

**Andrew Murray:** But as you said, tissues will carry on producing estrogen, especially in obese individuals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alexander Lipschutz showed that if you remove the ovaries and implant a tiny, continuous dose of estrogen, it is very carcinogenic. But if you interrupt that with progesterone periodically, you don't get cancer. In his experiments, uninterrupted estrogen was carcinogenic to basically everything.

## Caller: Vitamin E and Digestion

**Caller 1 (Kansas City):** Hi Dr. Peat. What do you think is happening if someone experiences digestive cramps and bloating within 30 minutes of using Vitamin E orally? This occurs even when switching products, and even when using Progest-E, which contains Vitamin E.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's the viscous, oily quality that is irritating. Some people have that reaction. For example, if they try to use it in their armpit where the skin is sensitive, the highly viscous oil can be irritating. It should be taken with food so that it doesn't hit the membranes in a concentrated form.

**Caller 1 (Kansas City):** Do you think it's possible to develop a soy allergy somewhere along the way?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many people have soy allergies, but the oil doesn't contain the proteins that people are usually allergic to. I haven't heard of any documented allergy to oily soy products.

**Caller 1 (Kansas City):** Do you think 400 IU of alpha-tocopherol with 300 mg of mixed tocopherols is excessive and possibly being excreted in bile, irritating the intestine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I doubt it because the effect of Vitamin E on many cell processes is anti-inflammatory. It inhibits prostaglandin formation, similar to aspirin.

## Caller: Iodine and Thyroid "Storm"

**Caller 2 (Mexico):** Hi. I know someone who took a few milligrams of extra iodine and went into a hyperthyroid-like crisis state—weak muscles, high pulse. Years later, she still gets that reaction from thyroid medication. Is that related to iodine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Back in the years when people in certain regions like southern Mexico or Ohio were very deficient in iodine, they would develop an enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). When they ate iodine, even a normal amount, their gland would suddenly start forming thyroid hormone. If the goiter was very big, they could have serious hyperthyroidism that could last for years. If the gland was just slightly swollen, it would pass in about two months.

**Andrew Murray:** So that's a real sequela of using iodine in that individual?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If they took their iodine in the form of thyroid hormone, they could normalize their body functions and replace iodine in a limited, graded fashion. Getting the required amount of hormone would cause their pituitary to settle down and let the gland gradually shrink.

**Caller 2 (Mexico):** Is there any tip on tolerating thyroid hormone now?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who have trouble with thyroid hormone can be deficient in magnesium. Hypothyroidism makes tissues fail to retain magnesium. When you supplement thyroid, you suddenly experience an extreme magnesium deficiency in the heart and brain. Taking magnesium with the thyroid helps. Others, if deficient in adrenal or gonadal steroids, will suffer stress symptoms. Using a supplement like pregnenolone will make them tolerate the thyroid more easily.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about people who take T4 (thyroxine) and get weak muscles and a pounding heart? Is that because they aren't converting it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When people have been low thyroid for a long time, they likely have high adrenaline and cortisol. That causes them to turn T4 into reverse T3, blocking the active T3 hormone. Accumulating more T4 interferes competitively with the little T3 they do have, exaggerating the hypothyroidism.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you say T4 is only 10% as active as T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It varies. In the 1940s, they tested it on young male medical students, and it was exactly as effective as Armour Natural Thyroid because young men have good livers that convert it perfectly. But women, especially under stress with high estrogen, won't convert it well. I've seen people get more depressed or psychotic when they increased their thyroxine dose.

**Caller 2 (Mexico):** She was using very small specks of T3, under 1 microgram. Should she hold that low dose and increase very slowly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I've known people who stayed with 1 microgram doses of T3 for a week or two. You have to make sure your whole diet is very good—protein, sugar, calcium, and magnesium.

## Caller: Buteyko Breathing and Heart Rate

**Caller 3 (New York):** I have a question about Buteyko breathing. Dr. Buteyko noted that as you retain more CO2, the heart rate decreases. I know you recommend a high heart rate typically. What do you think about this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Experiments with animals show that increasing CO2 relaxes the blood vessels, decreasing peripheral resistance. This makes the heart able to pump more blood more easily with less work, usually meaning a bigger stroke volume.

**Caller 3 (New York):** So even though it's a lower heart rate, the metabolism is still good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Most people are running on adrenaline. I've known people with pulse rates of 130 or 180 who, within two weeks of thyroid supplementation, got down to a normal pulse under 100. Thyroid increases CO2, decreases lactic acid and inflammation, and opens capillaries so the heart doesn't have to work so frantically.

## Thyroid Nodules

**Andrew Murray:** Benign and malignant thyroid nodules are far more common in females than males. What can be done to offset the estrogenic burden?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Studies of thyroid slices in vitro found that added estrogen caused cells to keep synthesizing hormone and growing, but fail to secrete it. When they added progesterone, it began secreting. Nodules are basically the process of estrogen activating cell division and synthesis of colloid, while desensitizing the cells to the hormone-secreting effect of TSH. Progesterone, by antagonizing estrogen, will reverse those processes.

## Caller: Restless Leg Syndrome

**Caller 4 (Local):** I was wondering if Vitamin D, thyroid, and magnesium have anything to do with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There has been research showing that people taking SSRI antidepressants tended to have episodes of restless legs. They saw that nitric oxide and serotonin were involved. Those are produced largely from an irritated intestine. Hypothyroid people typically overproduce both nitric oxide and serotonin and have sluggish digestion. Serotonin seems to be specifically what pushes those motor nerves that cause the leg jumpiness.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would you recommend aspirin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, pregnenolone, aspirin, and avoiding irritating foods, especially legumes and raw green salads.

**Caller 4 (Local):** That's interesting because my partner has this, and we had just switched to eating a lot more of both of those.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned she had low Vitamin D?

**Caller 4 (Local):** Yes, very low.

**Andrew Murray:** She should really load up. If using a 2000 IU drop, take six to eight drops a day for a few days, then maintain 4000 to 6000 IU, and remeasure in two months.

## Nitric Oxide and Spinach

**Andrew Murray:** I saw a website touting nitric oxide as beneficial and suggesting spinach to increase it. I know you say kale can be thyroid suppressive, but what about spinach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's organically grown without intense nitrate fertilization, and if it's well cooked, I think spinach is good food.

**Andrew Murray:** What about testing salivary nitrite to assess nitric oxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A recent article suggested measuring nitric oxide products to diagnose hypothyroidism because they are so closely connected. I would guess urine might be better than saliva, because thinking of food or being anxious can change the composition of your saliva. Urine gives a better picture of your level of stress.

## Caller: Testosterone for Transgender Teen

**Caller 5 (Shelter Cove):** My 16-year-old daughter is transgender and wants to take testosterone to masculinize. Is that safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that's safe, but it should be backed up with pregnenolone and some progesterone to keep things in balance. The tendency is, if you're under stress, for the testosterone to turn into estrogen. Pregnenolone and progesterone will limit that conversion.

## Conclusion: Reducing Estrogen Burden

**Andrew Murray:** To wrap up, regarding the female issue of estrogen, inflammation, and cancers: would you typically want to lower the estrogenic burden by offsetting it with progesterone, pregnenolone, and thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, thyroid and adequate nutrition. All the vitamins and minerals are involved in keeping estrogen under the safe limit. When you inhibit the formation of thyroid hormone, TSH fails to make thyroxine and T3. It keeps stimulating the thyroid gland, making it grow, but it also has a related effect on every tissue. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is associated with low thyroid and high TSH. TSH drives inflammation, so the so-called autoimmune conditions associated with high estrogen are largely because of high TSH exposure driving tumor necrosis factor and various inflammatory cytokines.

**Andrew Murray:** Excellent. Dr. Peat has an extensive library of fully referenced articles on his website, www.raypeat.com. Thank you for your time, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
