## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's August 19, 2022 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have just tuned in, this is a monthly radio show where we are joined by the expert scientific viewpoint of Dr. Raymond Peat. We appreciate all those who tune in live or listen to the archives at kmud.org or westernbotanicalmedicine.com. I am very pleased to welcome Dr. Peat to the show. I know he is recovering from some voice hoarseness due to the wildfires in Oregon. How are you doing, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I probably should clarify what I mean by "scientific viewpoint." I'm not like Fauci; I don't have *the* scientific viewpoint. I think of the scientific viewpoint as a critical one—always thinking about the evidence and what you're really implying. It's a matter of criticism and thinking.

**Andrew Murray:** You are always able to back up what you say with articles or reference journals. Just in case anyone listening doesn't know you, could you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied the humanities first through a master's degree, and then went back in 1968 to the University of Oregon for a PhD in biology. Basically physiological chemistry, specifically the metabolic and physiological changes that happen in the reproductive system during aging. There is a chapter of that dissertation where I concentrated on what was still sometimes called lipofuscan as a basic cause of aging.

## The Myth of Essential Fatty Acids (PUFA)

**Andrew Murray:** I want to expand on your work regarding lipofuscin. We’ve mentioned it in relation to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Public awareness has exploded recently with publications stating that PUFAs are not safe, contrary to the thinking of the last three decades. Can we start by going over some basics regarding these so-called "essential fatty acids"? If you look online, it implies they are only available from the diet. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. Some very simple experiments make that really clear, but that clarity has hardly penetrated the beliefs about the facts over the last 80 years because industry has found a motive in claiming they are essential.

The evidence against it is clear. For example, you can grow human cells in culture. If you are growing huge masses of cells, you know exactly what they are being fed. You can feed them a diet absolutely excluding unsaturated fatty acids. They multiply enormously on a diet of no environmental unsaturated fats. Obviously, any unsaturated fat they contain is something they have made themselves.

The evidence that we aren't getting environmental linoleic or arachidonic acid and are becoming "deficient" is based on the finding that we make something called Mead acid. Mead acid is an omega-9 series polyunsaturated fat with a long saturated tail—just the opposite of fish oil. The n-3 (omega-3) series has unsaturated groups within three carbons of the tip. The type we make ourselves, the Mead acids, have saturated fats extending down to within nine carbons at the end. That makes them relatively resistant to external contact with oxygen.

**Andrew Murray:** That is important. The erroneous doctrine of them being essential and the fact that we can manufacture them brings into question the fish oil industry and the anti-inflammatory dogma. You have said in the past that the placenta doesn't allow these fats to cross. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is a very good filter. Even when the mother is eating fish, grains, and unsaturated fats, babies demonstrate at birth that they are making some of the anti-inflammatory, natural Mead acid. This shows they were assimilating very little of the PUFA from the environment.

Defining the newborn baby as "essential fatty acid deficient," formula companies argued that they need to add fish oil extract to baby formula to make up for the fact that the newborn brain shows evidence of deficiency. Within a few days of reaching the grocery store, these fats are degrading, oxidizing, and becoming toxic. The evidence suggests that what you're doing is feeding the baby rancid fish oil products.

## PUFA Effects on Brain Development

**Andrew Murray:** Haven't they done experiments showing that babies fed on these formulas containing EPA and other fatty acids show decreased cognition compared to the "fussy" baby—one that is active and awake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those studies were done over the last 70 or 80 years in rats, dogs, and other animals. They showed that in proportion to the amount of PUFA in the diet, their brains are reduced in size and learning ability after birth. The "deficient" animals without the PUFA have bigger brains, are higher metabolizers, and learn much faster. Some studies in the 70s suggested the average rodent deficient in PUFA had the equivalent of a 140 IQ compared to its EPA-drugged siblings.

If you look at the aging brain, the amount of PUFA steadily increases from the so-called deficient state at birth up to a heavy overload state in old age and dementia. This steady increase in PUFA concentration interferes with cholesterol synthesis. As the PUFA content of tissue increases, the heat production and metabolic energy of the whole animal decreases. The baby has extremely high overall oxygen consumption and metabolic rate, supporting that fantastic rate of learning normal for a newborn.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** An interesting side note: I'm not someone who suffers from heartburn, but when I was pregnant, if I ate any PUFA-rich animal fat—like duck, chicken, or pork fat—I immediately got heartburn. I was avoiding vegetable oils, but even a tiny bit of those animal fats caused it. It was very easy for me to see why I shouldn't be eating PUFA when pregnant.

**Andrew Murray:** The essential fatty acid myth has been destroyed. The word "collusion" applies to these multi-billion dollar industries—like the fish oil industry—and academia pumping out supporting evidence for anti-inflammatory effects. Ultimately, the baby in the womb is protected by a mechanism that selectively blocks the transport of these products.

## Dietary Sources and Oxidation

**Andrew Murray:** These n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are found in many foods. You’ve said fish oil is the most rapidly oxidizable, but also nuts and seeds. When they make oil from nuts and seeds, the volume is unnatural. Given that our diet is so broad, do you think these should be consumed at all?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they should be avoided as far as possible.

**Andrew Murray:** Why are they found in nature then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nuts and seeds produce oils, and snakes, frogs, and fish use them habitually without problem. Those oils are appropriate for them because they live at a fairly low temperature. Animal fats at room temperature tend to solidify; a snake with solidified fat doesn't work very well. If you are going to have flexible, active tissues in the cold, you need fats that are liquid.

However, if you put these fats—which are designed to be sensitive to heat so they stay flexible—into a very hot animal (98°F), they become extremely unstable. That means you shouldn't eat them if you are going to live at 98 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's okay for frogs and snakes because they are cold-blooded and won't oxidize those fats. But because we are warm, we rapidly oxidize them into free radicals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. In some studies, they tested the efficiency of fish oil as an energy source for salmon. They added some animal fat (more saturated) to a salmon diet and put them through an endurance test. The salmon eating the saturated fat had better endurance.

## Lipofuscin Formation and Toxicity

**Andrew Murray:** Can you outline the process by which metal ions and stressors exert their effect on these n-3 and n-6 oils to create lipofuscin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starting in the 1930s, people learned to manufacture something that looked and functioned like lipofuscin by reacting copper, iron, or just about any kind of fat with biological components like nucleic acids and proteins. The free radical process is triggered by the copper or iron and a reductant, such as Vitamin C. This attracts the oily materials, especially if unsaturated, and causes a spreading, catalytic oxidative process.

Various things are poured out of tissues depending on the injury. If it's the liver and you're under the influence of estrogen or alcohol, the liver produces lots of porphyrin (a chemical used for making heme). Porphyrin will spontaneously amplify the formation of lipofuscin. Tissue injury releases fragments of damaged cell material, and all that contributes to lipofuscin formation.

It can form in a soluble form first, traveling between cells and through the bloodstream. Some forms only as particles in lysosomes or mitochondria. It is a very comprehensive theory of sickness, aging, and degeneration.

**Andrew Murray:** Did you say lipofuscin can be soluble?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yes.

**Andrew Murray:** I thought it was always an insoluble complex of iron, protein, and sugars that got laid down in nervous tissue. If it's soluble, can it be excreted?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure, some of it shows up in the urine.

**Andrew Murray:** In that case, would things like bitters or liver stimulants that improve digestion and excretion help remove soluble lipofuscin before it becomes permanent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Accelerating your digestive processes in general will help.

**Andrew Murray:** What is the difference between the lipofuscin found in endothelial plaque versus the Lewy bodies or amyloid plaque in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the type of injury, the type of fat, and the quantity you are exposed to. If it's an extremely fat-loving material, it will stick in your nerve cells. Huntington's disease is closely connected to certain types of PUFA-derived lipofuscin. Each type of nerve malfunction is associated with a particular protein, like synuclein.

You can trace its history. It is a balance between how fast you put it in and how fast you remove it. Removal is slow. But if you stop the formation by stopping excess intake of aluminum, iron, copper, and unsaturated fats, you can reduce the formation almost to zero. At that point, the slight attrition by way of Vitamin E can gradually reduce the amount in the brain.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think fish oil is more implicated in lipofuscin production than flax or corn oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The type of molecule is extremely variable. Early studies feeding fish to pigs, horses, dogs, and mink identified "yellow fat disease," in which the animal's fat became a source of dangerous inflammation.

## Caller Questions: Coconut Milk & Nut Milks

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller. You're on the air.

**Caller:** I love organic coconut milk and I'm wondering what its benefits are. Also, what other nut milks do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not especially wild about coconut milk. Studies in the Philippines found that people who cook with it frequently have a high incidence of breast cancer. I'm not sure about its natural contents versus the processing.

**Caller:** I mean drinking it without heating it, putting fruit in it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's the actual water from an unripe coconut, that is fine. But what they call "coconut milk" or "cream" is a manufactured process where they grind up solid material and suspend it in water. I don't think it's safe.

**Caller:** What nut milks do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there is such a thing. They can make any emulsion that's white and liquid and call it milk—grain, bean, or nut milk—but that doesn't have any nutritional value in a positive sense.

**Caller:** You mentioned linoleic acid is fabulous... what other acids should we consume?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think there is a misunderstanding. Dr. Peat recommends *avoiding* linoleic acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coconut oil in itself has some real adaptogenic properties by interfering with the PUFA.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To clarify for the caller: Dr. Peat recommends coconut *oil*. He does not recommend Omega-3, Omega-6, seed oils, or nut/bean milks.

## Vitamin C and Orange Juice

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned earlier that reductants like Vitamin C could drive lipofuscin production in the presence of n-3 and n-6 fats. How does that relate to drinking large amounts of orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Too much Vitamin C easily activates stray atoms of aluminum, iron, zinc, or mercury. However, fruits like oranges contain bioflavonoids. In the right quantity, Vitamin C functions as an oxidant inside the healthy cell. The bioflavonoids help keep the cell oxidizing. But if you take, say, 5 grams of pure Vitamin C, you get a gigantic surge of reductive energy that throws cells in the opposite direction, turning on the lipofuscin and carcinogenic process.

**Andrew Murray:** So drinking half a gallon of orange juice a day is safe because of the moderation spread over the day and the bioflavonoids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, you're getting large amounts of pro-oxidant bioflavonoids which balance it.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you condone using isolated citrus bioflavonoid supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In purified form, some of those can be reductants the same way an excess of Vitamin C can. It is better to get them from the whole fruit where they work with the system.

## Humans and Dairy

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had a caller with bad reception ask: Why is cow milk okay for humans since we're the only species that drinks another species' milk after weaning?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it has to do with the size of our brain and our culture. We have evolved on a high-fruit, high-carbohydrate diet. In that diet, a very high calcium intake happens to synergize with other factors to optimize brain function.

## Vitamin E

**Andrew Murray:** What about Vitamin E's protective role? Some suggest we need large amounts.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The definition of Vitamin E has changed. In the 1920s and 30s, it was a fertility-extending, anti-estrogen chemical. As the toxic effects of unsaturated fats were identified, it was rebranded in the 1940s as merely an antioxidant. Now, it is coming to be recognized again as an anti-inflammatory, estrogen-regulating substance.

**Andrew Murray:** What daily dose would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something like 20 or 30 milligrams.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How does that compare to International Units (IU)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The language has changed to milligrams, but they refer to mixed tocopherols. For about 20 years you could only refer to D-alpha tocopherol as Vitamin E, but now the value of gamma and delta tocopherols is being recognized.

## Estrogen and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Lastly, regarding estrogen. You’ve always said it is inflammatory. Is its effect on lipofuscin formation equivocal?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can treat all these things as synergizing factors. The amount of PUFA, ionizing radiation, heavy metals, and estrogen are at least additive. If you oppose any one of those—reducing estrogen exposure, for example—you reduce tissue fibrosis, inflammation, degeneration, and cancer. These can be alleviated by simple natural anti-inflammatory things including carbon dioxide, progesterone, and thyroid function.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat can be found at raypeat.com. The main takeaway from this show is that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), often touted as health-beneficial, are erroneous. We can mitigate their effects. I wasn't aware lipofuscin could be soluble, which means digestive bitters, hepatic stimulants, and preventing constipation can help excrete these waste products before they become permanent.

For those still thinking fish oil is good for you, the evidence suggests otherwise. Switching to saturated fats and supporting liver function are key strategies. Until next month, thank you for listening.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you very much for joining the show.
