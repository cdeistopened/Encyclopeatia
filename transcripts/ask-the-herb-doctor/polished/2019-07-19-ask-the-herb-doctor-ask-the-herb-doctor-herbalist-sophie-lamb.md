# Ask Your Herb Doctor: Herbal Medicine & Physiology

**Host:** Andrew Murray
**Co-Host:** Sarah Johanneson Murray
**Guests:** Dr. Raymond Peat and Sophie Lamb

---

## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome once again to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. We broadcast every third Friday of the month on KMUD Garberville. We discuss a wide range of alternative medicines and health topics. I'm very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us once more. Dr. Peat, would you please give our listeners a rundown of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After studying and teaching the humanities and linguistics—various things except biology—before 1968, I went to graduate school in biology to get a Ph.D. in 1972. I specialized in the aging physiology of reproduction, but in general studied physiology and biochemistry. Since then, I have been doing short courses and counseling.

**Andrew Murray:** This month, I'm very pleased to welcome Sophie Lamb, daughter of distinguished medical herbalist Brian Lamb. Welcome to the show, Sophie.

**Sophie Lamb:** Thank you so much. I'm delighted to be here.

**Andrew Murray:** I've always called you a second-generation herbalist, but actually, your father's background goes back further.

**Sophie Lamb:** My father's background involves about four generations of doctors and surgeons going back about 200 years. Although they were surgeons and doctors, a big part of the medicines they used at the time was herbal medicine, so they had their apothecaries alongside their surgeries.

**Andrew Murray:** I know Brian is 82 now. He qualified in 1978 from the School of Herbal Medicine and has been in full-time practice since. He also manufactures a wide range of fluid extracts and syrups.

**Sophie Lamb:** He is amazing. He works full-time, gets up with the birds, and works all day long. I think it's driven by the passion he has for his job and the love for the herbs. He is still discovering and exploring because it's something you could study for a lifetime and still not extinguish all there is to know.

**Andrew Murray:** Like Dr. Peat, your father is very scientifically grounded in what he discusses. He is very much into the science in herbal medicine, isn't he?

**Sophie Lamb:** He spends his life researching. When he's not physically preparing herbs or seeing patients, he's researching.

**Andrew Murray:** He also spent time in America working for a Utah company, correct?

**Sophie Lamb:** Yes, he used to tour America giving lectures on herbal applications for cosmetics. He worked for a few network marketing companies designing herbal products. That stretched over about 10 years.

## Herbal Remedies for Coughs and Colds

**Andrew Murray:** Sophie, winter coughs and colds are common issues. Let's get an idea of what it was like growing up in a household on the northernmost tip of Scotland with an herbalist father.

**Sophie Lamb:** I have three sisters. When you have four young children, they typically develop coughs and chest infections. We lived at the very top of the map of the UK, looking over the Orkney Islands. We had an Aga stove in the kitchen, and my childhood memories are full of herbs drying on top and syrups being made at the side.

We all had whooping cough as children. What dad did for us was slice up garlic, smear the soles of our feet with Vaseline, apply thin slices of garlic, wrap it in cling film, and apply a sock. Within a few minutes, the volatile oils go through the bloodstream and you're breathing out garlic. That shortened the duration and severity of our whooping cough.

We also used to pick *Tussilago* (Coltsfoot). It makes the most incredible syrup because the flowers smell of honey. We would do a layer of flowers, a layer of sugar, and let them macerate by the side of the hot Aga.

One of the things my dad is most well known for is his thyme syrup. Thyme fits the need of the lungs like a glove. It's an antitussive (reduces the cough reflex), anti-edema on the lungs (reduces swelling), expectorant (helps spit out mucus), and antiseptic. He makes a syrup using Deeside water and molasses.

**Andrew Murray:** That's interesting. Your father uses a specific water.

**Sophie Lamb:** All of his extracts are made using Deeside water. It comes from the Pannanich Wells around Aberdeenshire. My dad worked as a consultant for this water company because he is also an engineer. The Royal Family used to travel to this area of Scotland to drink the healing water.

## Legal Status of Herbal Medicine

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to give a little background on the law and herbal medicine. In 1154, Henry II institutionalized Common Law, based on the premise that everything is legal unless deemed illegal. Herbal medicine has always been protected under Common Law. In 1542, Henry VIII implemented the Herbalist Charter, protecting the right to practice. Later, Nicholas Culpeper translated medical texts from Latin to English so the general public could use them.

However, European law is based on Napoleonic law—the premise that everything is illegal unless deemed legal. The National Institute of Medical Herbalists is working tirelessly to keep the practice safe from restrictive legislation coming from the European Union.

## Autism and Environmental Factors

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, regarding autism: what do you see as a safe approach to helping the autistic child, and what do you see as a cause?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think almost any environmental harm to the parents, especially the mother during pregnancy, increases the rate of autism. Environmental estrogens, things that cause hypothyroidism, and obesity are known causes.

A major source of adversity during pregnancy is medical radiation or medicalization in general. This includes too many X-ray exams, bad thyroid or endocrine therapy, and the use of toxic drugs. In Texas, a study showed Latino kids had a much lower rate of autism than the medicalized white residents. Touching has also been identified as essential for the nervous system to develop properly. Enriching the environment, removing toxins, and improving the thyroid and progesterone levels can remedy the autistic condition to some extent.

**Andrew Murray:** Sophie, do you have any anecdotal evidence regarding this?

**Sophie Lamb:** I have friends whose children have been severely autistic. They focused on diet and gut health. One friend's son would go into "stimming"—repetitive physical movements. A pediatrician prescribed a strong antifungal because it was suspected he had a fungal overgrowth producing alcohol in his system. The antifungals hugely modified his behavior.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you think about gut organisms metabolizing carbohydrates to produce ethanol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Intestinal flora produce lots of toxins. Yeast, in particular, produces both alcohol and estrogen. The estrogen is, I think, more toxic than the alcohol.

## Insomnia and Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** Sophie, sleep disturbance is a common presentation. How do you treat this?

**Sophie Lamb:** I was a severe insomniac for eight years. I learned from Dr. Peat that if you can get your stress hormones down, you will sleep. I was a chronic under-eater. A healthy individual should be able to get an eight-hour sleep because our glycogen stores feed the active brain through the night.

Sleep is an active process; the brain does a huge amount of repair. If we haven't laid down enough glycogen during the day, we get a rise in stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline) to catabolize fat and muscle for energy. A side effect of stress hormones is mental alertness, which you don't want at night. Insomnia is actually a daytime disorder presenting itself at night.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, can you speak to the liver's ability to store glycogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is essential for storing glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles. When you run out of glycogen, you mobilize free fatty acids. The free fatty acid condition creates a state of diabetes in the brain, turning off brain metabolism by essentially poisoning the mitochondria and blocking the ability to use glucose.

**Sophie Lamb:** In the UK and the US, we are told to avoid sugar and salt. Some mothers even avoid fructose for children. This creates a perfect storm for insomnia. If I have a patient with insomnia, the first place I look is diet, and the second is herbs.

## The Importance of Plants in Medicine

**Andrew Murray:** Sophie, tell us about your TED Talk.

**Sophie Lamb:** I gave a TED Talk with my sister Naomi titled *Why We Are Dependent on Plants for Medicine*. I felt it was important to reconnect the dots for people who think herbs are archaic. The Essential Medicines List of the World Health Organization has a significant proportion of drugs based on herbs.

Examples include morphine, lidocaine from coca leaves, aspirin, metformin from *Galega* (Goat's Rue), and Taxol from the Yew tree. 90% of our chemotherapeutic drugs have foundations in plants. It's important to realize that when you look out to the fields, you're walking past essential medicines.

## Dietary Myths: Sugar, Salt, and Fish Oils

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you say about the undoing of the instinctual craving for sugar and salt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those doctrines were created by the pharmaceutical industry. Around 1950, they convinced doctors that pregnant women had to use diuretics and restrict salt to prevent weight gain, which destroyed many pregnancies. The sugar ban appeared around the same time to sell polyunsaturated vegetable oils (PUFA). The food industry created the cholesterol myth to sell their oils and explain away heart disease, which is really the result of hypothyroidism.

**Andrew Murray:** Sophie, are fish oils still advertised as healthful in Europe?

**Sophie Lamb:** Definitely still very buoyant. But interestingly, last year a newspaper published a study linking fish oils with liver disease and scarring.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, any thoughts on liver scarring and fish oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of stresses contribute, but definitely not good foods like saturated fats and sugar.

## Caller: Fulvic Acid, Thyroid, and Red Light

**Caller (Jeff):** I have questions about fulvic and humic acids. Are the enzymes and natural minerals associated with those beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they're mildly harmful because they can release toxic things. Any minerals would be beneficial, but the substances themselves are not safe.

**Caller (Jeff):** I found them helpful for a skin rash. My other question is about thyroid. If someone improves their diet and lowers PUFA, why isn't it possible to eliminate thyroid supplements eventually?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen people stop or reduce their supplement. For some, it happens in a week. Others take three or four years. A person saturated with unsaturated fats has to get rid of that stored thyroid-inhibiting fat before they can get away from a supplement.

**Andrew Murray:** What about electromagnetic radiation disrupting thyroid activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That, and environmental estrogens in tooth fillings or food packaging, block the thyroid.

**Caller (Jeff):** What does red light do physiologically compared to CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Red light restores the electronic balance of cytochrome oxidase, the crucial enzyme of oxidative metabolism. Stress lowers that activity. Red light also helps with inflammation. Radiation poisoning can be neutralized by exposure to red light within the first hour.

## Caller: Celery Juice and Sugar Intake

**Caller:** What are the benefits of drinking 16 ounces of celery juice a day?

**Sophie Lamb:** It's a craze in the UK right now. It has minerals like potassium, and people seem to lose water retention.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main problem is that quite a few people are allergic to it.

**Caller:** Dr. Peat, how much sugar do you consume a day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I try to get it all from fruit, but when I don't have good fruit, I fill in with white refined sugar. I try to get more than half of my calories from sugar. Maybe 1,500 to 1,600 calories.

## Caller: Low Iron and Ferritin

**Caller:** My circulating iron is fine, but my ferritin is quite low (6 micrograms per liter). My doctor suggests iron injections. Should I have them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is required for absorbing copper, which is needed for integrating iron with the blood. You need to get your waking temperature close to 98°F. Thyroid is the main factor. You can get a high intake of iron safely if you eat liver and eggs every day with orange juice.

**Caller:** I eat liver and eggs, but my stores are still low.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your iron saturation is very low, injections might be justified, but I've seen terrible effects from them. Oysters are another good source.

**Sophie Lamb:** Traditionally, nettle tea and blackstrap molasses help strengthen the blood.

## Caller: High Pulse/Temp and Chlorine Dioxide

**Caller:** What can be done for someone with a high temperature and pulse but still has chronic fatigue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Check vitamin D and calcium intake. High waking temperature might be adrenaline-based. Check your pulse and temperature again at 10 or 11 a.m. If it's steady after food, it might be something other than adrenaline.

**Caller:** Have you heard of chlorine dioxide for autistic symptoms?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are safer antiseptic agents. Long-term use could promote cancer. Fibrous food helps disinfect the intestine.

**Sophie Lamb:** Cat's claw is very anti-inflammatory for the gut and has some research for brain inflammation.

## Caller: Whooping Cough Remedies for Infants

**Caller:** I'm seven months pregnant. There is a potential outbreak of whooping cough here. Are the garlic and thyme syrup treatments safe for infants?

**Sophie Lamb:** Thyme syrup is usually made from dried thyme. I used it on my son from six months onward. For infants, use much reduced doses.

**Caller:** Is the garlic safe?

**Sophie Lamb:** It is innocuous, but don't leave it on so long that it burns. Maybe a couple of minutes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I heard a trick to keep it from burning is to peel it without damaging the skin and put it in a sock against the infant's foot. If you break the skin of the bulb, the oil is more irritating.

**Sophie Lamb:** Yes, a whole peeled clove, not sliced.
