## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows before, we run them every third Friday of the month. We are both licensed practitioners of herbal medicine. We qualified in England in 2000 and 1999 and have been practicing ever since. We were very pleased to discover Dr. Raymond Peat back in 2008 through a breast cancer survivor who was lauding Dr. Peat and his protocols. Dr. Peat has been very kindly sharing his time pretty much every third Friday of the month for about 11 years now.

Tonight, the bulk of the show is going to be on the science and principles behind a mechanistic determinant of cancer described as MTOR—specifically MTOR 1 and MTOR 2. We will get into the biology of it, how it was discovered, and how it has been targeted in the suppression of cancer. Dr. Peat, would you let people know who you are and what your academic and scientific background is?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After studying and teaching for about 10 years in the humanities, I decided to go back to graduate school at the University of Oregon for a PhD in biology, reproductive physiology, and biochemistry. Since 1972, I've been doing personal consulting. For 40 years, since 1981, I've been writing a newsletter—first monthly, now quarterly—developing themes that relate to health, aging, fertility, and the nature of life.

**Andrew Murray:** The background of your life was the scientific investigation into aging and reproduction. You found opposition from entrenched dogmas, especially regarding the estrogen industry and the ubiquitous use of seed oils. You've always looked deeper into cause and effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason I waited until 1968 to do any academic study in biology was that already in the late 1940s and 50s, I had decided that genetics was based on fraudulent, make-believe science. If you really read the classical papers that molecular biology is based on, there's no real science there. It wouldn't convince anyone who wasn't already convinced that the organism is made up of reductionist, unchanging units called genes.

## Estrogen, Progesterone, and Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Before we get into the topic of this evening, I want to touch on your firmly held beliefs about the unscrupulous estrogen industry. Estrogen is in the scientific literature as the prime causative factor behind many different cancers. The inflammatory effects of estrogen trigger excitotoxic states within cells, disorganizing and wasting their energy, allowing spontaneous tumors to arise.

You have been a big advocate of the antithesis of estrogen, which is progesterone. A female enjoying 14 days of progesterone exposure per month has a very good chance—especially if they have repeat pregnancies—of having a decreased chance of getting hormone-dependent estrogen cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having a child fairly early in life is a huge protection against getting cancer. Animal studies show that if a rabbit is bred starting early and as often as it can for the rest of its life, its tissues at any old age are much younger than if it had been a virgin all those years. That was backed up by looking at the relation between the number of children per woman in Hungary. There was a straight increase in longevity with the number of babies, up to eight.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to remind listeners that it's not just females that produce estrogen; males are also subject to the effects of estrogen, especially with aging. In England, with the pub culture of drinking beer, as males get older you see gynecomastia (male breast enlargement) and belly fat. This is an outward expression of estrogen dominance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Old men typically have more estrogen than women. Not just the ratio, but their testosterone is being massively converted to estrogen by the time they're 65 or 70.

**Andrew Murray:** This enzyme, aromatase, is expressed in many different cells—liver, placenta, bones, and breast tissue. It converts testosterone to estrone. Blocking this enzyme can be important in reducing estrogen dominance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 1940s, one experimenter implanted a very small dose of estrogen in animals that had their ovaries removed. The tiniest amount of uninterrupted estrogen produced cancer in every tissue. But if you interrupted it periodically, even a large amount of estrogen didn't lead to cancer. Similar to the aging rabbits or Hungarian women, the quantity and regularity of the progesterone interruption of estrogen just about completely protects against the development of cancer.

## Understanding MTOR and Rapamycin

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move to the activity of the enzyme MTOR. This is described as the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin or the Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin. There are two subclades: MTOR 1 and MTOR 2. Could you describe MTOR, its discovery, and the antibiotic effect of rapamycin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This particular antibiotic, rapamycin, was used as a fungus killer. It is broad-spectrum but especially effective against fungus. It happens to be in the same family of antibiotics as azithromycin and erythromycin. It's a ring structure, and those are known to have an amazing spectrum of activity. This class of antibiotics happens to kill viruses as well as fungus.

After it was discovered to be a great treatment for fungal infections, it was found to have many other effects, such as anti-inflammatory effects. In exploring how the anti-inflammatory effect works, they found that it was acting on a particular kinase—an enzyme that attaches phosphate groups to functional proteins. This phosphorylation directs it towards growth and inflammation.

They found that the antibiotic inhibiting this particular phosphorylating enzyme extended lifespan drastically and reduced cancer and inflammatory diseases. The wastage of energy is one thing in common with inflammatory diseases, aging, diabetes, and cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** So rapamycin inhibits this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The target of this antibiotic, rapamycin (also called sirolimus), controls energy flow. An abundance of energy intake—especially fats and proteins—are the normal activators of MTOR Complex 1. Growth hormone is a major activator of MTOR Complex 2, which is insensitive to the antibiotics.

So, for matters of diet and treatment, the attention is mostly on MTOR Complex 1 because there are so many foods that activate it. Methionine is probably the main activator of MTOR. Meat, besides being a major source of methionine, is also a major source of iron. It happens that both iron and phosphate are activators of MTOR Complex 1.

Milk contains a lot of methionine, but parathyroid hormone is an activator of MTOR, and milk's high calcium content—working with vitamin D—lowers parathyroid hormone. So, milk contains its own antidote working against the toxic effects of methionine via the great concentration of calcium and a very low concentration of phosphate and iron.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Are you suggesting that MTOR is a trigger for cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Cancer, inflammation, aging degeneration like arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Basically, rapamycin is an antifungal antibiotic that blocks MTOR, and therefore they're finding anti-cancer benefits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It, or similar derivatives, is now used in treating various cancers—breast cancer, pancreas cancer, prostate cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And is it true that they found it on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in a soil sample?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Dietary Inhibitors of MTOR

**Andrew Murray:** I'd like to discuss substances—drugs or phytochemicals—that block MTOR, and how that informs a treatment rationale.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee is a source of flavonoids like quercetin and caffeine; both of those are anti-MTOR agents. Orange juice and other fruits are very effective flavonoid sources for reducing MTOR.

**Michael (Engineer):** I have a question. You started giving a list of foods that support bad MTOR and reduce it. I'd love more of a list. Also, regarding estrogen metabolism in foods: are there foods that help men if they are converting testosterone to estrogen? And are there foods that could get men to convert their testosterone to progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think back-conversion can happen. Progesterone is a precursor to the glucocorticoids like cortisol, but it doesn't go down the pathway towards testosterone or estrogen. The precursor to those is DHEA.

**Andrew Murray:** How about aromatase inhibitors?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just about everything that's good for you tends to inhibit aromatase because it is activated by stress, cortisol, and prostaglandins, and inhibited by progesterone. All of the things associated with inflammation and degeneration—for example, angiotensin—work through MTOR. So if you block angiotensin, you're helping to lower MTOR. All of the estrogens promote MTOR; progesterone inhibits it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Even the weaker estrogens like estrone stimulate MTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they all add up to the same estrogen effect. But estradiol is at least 10 times stronger than the others. Progesterone activates the conversion of estradiol to estrone (the inactive form) and activates the detoxifying enzyme system that adds glucuronic acid or sulfuric acid to the estrogen so it can be excreted. Another mechanism is that progesterone breaks down the estrogen receptor.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you recommend progesterone for men who are converting their testosterone into estradiol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee, progesterone, flavonoids, and aspirin. Aspirin is a major MTOR inhibitor and aromatase inhibitor.

**Andrew Murray:** So essentially, most anti-inflammatories will have that blocking activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not everything. For example, doctors have been taught to prescribe Tylenol instead of aspirin. But in fact, Tylenol activates MTOR and increases inflammatory degenerative processes. Its antidote is aspirin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** With anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and Tylenol, they actually increase your risk of stroke. They do not decrease it like aspirin does.

**Michael:** Would glutathione be as bad as methionine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, too much glutathione activates MTOR.

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to mention some specific flavonoids. We've discussed EGCG from green tea, caffeine, and curcumin. Also berberine-rich herbs like Goldenseal and Oregon Grape. Quercetin is found in onions—which is why onion syrup is such a successful treatment for colds. Nettles and pomegranate are also good sources. Resveratrol from Japanese Knotweed and grape skins, and fisetin found in strawberries and persimmons, are also useful.

## Calorie Restriction and Metabolism

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what about calorie restriction? When you're young, you need calories to grow, but it seems counterproductive when you get older. How do you avoid turning into a walking skeleton while suppressing MTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think calorie restriction is necessary. The metabolic rate slows after age 20 and continues falling, especially after the mid-40s. The reason for that is the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) primarily, which shift our metabolism to prefer the oxidation of fat rather than glucose.

If you are oxidizing glucose at a high rate, the resulting carbon dioxide is our basic anti-inflammatory substance. The aim is to prevent the shift towards oxidizing fatty acids. The essence of diabetes is that you can't oxidize glucose, so you oxidize fat instead, resulting in the breakdown of glucose to lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide. Lactic acid activates MTOR.

So, you want to do the opposite of diabetes. Cancer is the same: you fail to oxidize glucose and instead oxidize fatty acids, leading to inflammation. Instead of inhibiting MTOR with carbon dioxide, you activate it with lactic acid. If you can avoid the stress that causes you to oxidize fatty acids, you avoid supporting the secretion of growth hormone and MTOR Complex 1.

## Protein Sources and Glutathione

**Michael:** How much glutathione would be too much? And could you list some protein sources similar to milk so that you get a good dose of protein without pushing your MTOR up too much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think calcium is what makes the big difference between milk and other proteins.

**Michael:** So a bone broth sort of thing would be better?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, gelatin. Naturally extracted gelatin, like chicken skin and bone broth with the fat skimmed off, contains a very low level of methionine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And it contains the amino acid glycine, which has lots of other health benefits. So not only is it deficient in the MTOR-stimulating methionine, it's also practically pure glycine.

**Michael:** I know some people, including myself, take supplemental glutathione as a liver antioxidant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a reductant. Any of the reduced intracellular materials, while on the way to reaching the cell, are likely to be oxidized by stray iron or copper atoms and produce toxic things in the bloodstream. If you increase the reductive balance of cells, you're putting them in the worst kind of stress—the aging degenerative condition. Glutathione is the cell's major anti-free radical detoxifying agent, but to add it as a food is very risky and I think almost 100% likely to be harmful rather than helpful.

## Caller: Wisdom Teeth and Dental Health

**Caller:** I'm from Queens, New York. Dr. Peat, what is your opinion on wisdom tooth extractions and root canals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the pulp is infected, it's probably good to put in a safe filling material like calcium hydroxide and let the immune system take over once you've cleaned out the infection. But I don't think it's good to pull any tooth that isn't an ongoing issue.

A good model of why it's something to avoid is a rat study. If you pull a molar of a rat, giving it cognitive tests before and after, they lose cognitive ability just from the extraction of one molar. The brain participates everywhere in the body. You can't separate body metabolism from brain metabolism.

**Caller:** I currently have a wisdom tooth with a big cavity. Dentists just want to extract it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can control the pain by scraping out the decayed material and sticking in a temporary filling—for example, zinc and eugenol makes a plastic that hardens—it reduces pain and stops infection. If your wisdom tooth isn't doing any biting work, a temporary filling would probably take care of it. You can use a dental tool or steel probe to scrape the tooth until it's hard, then put the eugenol zinc filling in.

**Andrew Murray:** Just as an aside, we found a very good holistic dentist in Medford, Oregon, named Dr. Tanner. He doesn't use injections to numb anything before doing a cavity, and he is very skilled. I encourage you to find a naturopathic dentist who will deal respectfully with you.
