## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM, my wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of field biology. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again. For people who perhaps have never listened to you or heard you, would you outline your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was a biology teacher before I studied biology professionally, actually about 10 years before. During those years before I went to graduate school in biology, I had taught English and other subjects, but I had done a lot of experimenting in bioelectric subjects, and that relates to the topic of biological fields. That had been a long-time interest of mine.

## Antioxidants and Oxidative Balance

**Andrew Murray:** I want to pick up a loose end from last month regarding antioxidants. I think it's very important that our listeners clearly understand that what they've been led to believe by nutraceutical companies as beneficial nutrients may in fact not be so, and that they should be treated with caution with reference to their action of blocking certain reactive oxygen species in the body.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For example, ascorbic acid functions primarily in the cell as an oxidant, maintaining cell structure and regulating synthetic processes largely by its oxidative form, dehydroascorbic acid. So, you don't want an excess of the reduced form.

Vitamin E had a history really starting as an anti-estrogen regulator of the sex hormones. After it was discovered that the unsaturated fatty acids were causing sexual derangement, sterility—especially in males—and brain decomposition, that was when Vitamin E shifted over to be described as an antioxidant rather than as an anti-estrogen. It's gradually being recognized as an anti-inflammatory agent, but it's still stuck in that mold of being called an antioxidant.

**Andrew Murray:** With reference to cancer and the new understanding of field biology—how cells are actually intelligent and drive the organism—what is the rationale behind suppressing reactive oxygen species as an antioxidant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are several interpretations. One group thinks that if you intensify the reactive oxygen species, you'll be able to kill the cancer cells because they are defending themselves by their excess antioxidant capacity. But others recognize that it's the reactive oxygen species that are causing the de-differentiation and aggressive, destructive processes in the cancer cells. So, reducing the formation of them metabolically is the safe, biological, organized way to go about preventing cancer. Preventing it really is part of curing the disease.

Some people have said that you can never tell when cancer is malignant until the patient is dead, because the organism always has the capacity for spontaneous recovery from any kind of tumor. It's most often seen in melanomas because you can clip off a few bits of the tumor and see that it's definitely cancerous. There is spontaneous regression seen so often in melanomas simply because they're near the surface and visible, but I think that spontaneous regression is probably going on all the time with many kinds of cancer.

## Topical Treatments and Skin Tumors

**Andrew Murray:** Am I right in thinking that you don't particularly advocate topical treatment of melanomas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Definitely not. Because so many things will disturb your defensive reactions against them and just annoy them, making them try to survive more intensely rather than more intelligently.

**Andrew Murray:** I ask because bloodroot (*Sanguinaria canadensis*) is a very commonly touted treatment for these tumors. I've met people who have showed me patches on their arms or legs where they've used bloodroot. The site looks a little scarred, but there's no presence of what was previously a discolored mole.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** What are the active chemicals in that?

**Andrew Murray:** Sanguinarine and probably hydrastine or some other alkaloids, but it also contains tannins. I know tannins have traditionally been used for skin tumors.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the old things that derived partly from herbal knowledge going back to the start of the 20th century was thinking of the molecular structure of these things as catalysts of energy production. William Frederick Koch was one that first proposed this, and it was developed later by Albert Szent-Györgyi. Particular molecules were explored by each of them. What they had in common was the activated ketone structure—activated carbonyl group—opposed by, for example, activated amine groups or hydroxyl groups. Estrogen is in that general irritating category. There are a lot of the tannin category of chemicals that unbalance, or in their most relevant part of the molecule, have this oxidative catalytic function that can restore the oxygen production of energy.

**Andrew Murray:** Sanguinaria does have a very intense red dye. We've talked about intense red dyes or herbs having this free radical quenching activity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That means they're absorbing high-energy particles.

**Andrew Murray:** But as far as you're concerned, you still don't advocate any topical use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think systemic is better because everything contains impurities, and just a little bit of the wrong impurity can irritate and possibly direct in the wrong direction. I haven't experimented at all with any of those older traditional things, but I did experiment on my own things.

A couple of doctors at different times were convinced that I had things that were melanomas from their shape and behavior. Probably a total of 15 or 20 times altogether, I've had things popping up that were black and blue, growing quickly, and changing shape. Just by increasing my thyroid systemically and putting some DHEA and/or progesterone on the skin adjacent to—maybe an inch away from—the developing spot, within two or three days you would see very intense changes happening. For example, the color would change from blue and white to maybe an even brown color, and then simply the whole thing would melt away.

It's like giving the cells what they need to differentiate properly. Otherwise, they go off exploring what they want to be to deal with the deficiency that they have. I think the particular areas they choose seem to be areas where the body is able to provide something that sustains their growth. If you can let the body provide more of that, increasing its energy, then those cells can go ahead and differentiate. The reducing or antioxidant direction of a cell is interfering with differentiation. There are several chemicals known as differentiating agents that some doctors are treating cancer with. What they have in common is a shift towards the oxidative balance of the cell.

**Andrew Murray:** From a scientific perspective, irritation has always been known to be cancer-causing. Any cell that gets chronically irritated is at risk. I think that's probably where your hesitancy with topically addressing anything comes from.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Although I know there have been very successful things. I've seen people with pink spots on their skin where they previously had a very aggressive tumor. I know an old woman—I saw her when she was 91, 92, and 93. In between my visits, I saw what had been a mole on the side of her forehead evolve into a hole where the bridge of her nose was eaten away by the melanoma. Next visit, there was nothing wrong with her nose. The nose had grown back.

## Genetics vs. Field Theory

**Andrew Murray:** Physiology is clearly a subject where nothing is isolated. However, knowledge can move along blind pathways. Last month you touched on James Watson as an example of an extreme reductionist now tending to be a little more open-minded. How is science to be moved in the right direction to allow a paradigm shift in our understanding of disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those people who were insisting on a kind of straight-line causality—Gregor Mendel, for example—wanted traits to be eternal rather than occasional, accidental, or changing. He did his experiments to show that even though the pea plants were changing, they had traits which were eternal. That got adopted by the gene people at the beginning of this century. That led to people like Watson identifying this eternal gene, except with the qualification that although it's like Mendel's eternal gene, it can be changed, but only by chance, not by anything intentionally useful to the individual organism.

At the same time, other people were showing evidence that the whole organism is influencing what happens to those traits—that the traits actually can be blended and changed rather than being discrete, absolutely causal units.

With the development of cybernetics, people saw that each level of organization has its own laws and causal processes. However, there were business interests that promoted the idea of genetic-based medicine. Each drug could identify a causal action on one of these causal genes. All through the 20th century, there were profit motives selling drugs for diseases supporting that idea of genetic causality.

But then the cloning and stem cell businesses started to be seen as viable. Those were things that the reductionists said absolutely couldn't exist—you can't have stem cells, you can't clone an animal from a body cell. Now that they saw that those could be good business, they changed the history. Barbara McClintock, who in the 40s and 50s had been treated rudely, was pulled out of obscurity in the 80s and 90s and given the MacArthur Grant and Nobel Prize to create a new history that would justify cloning as genetic engineering—changing the genes as something like a natural process. Science is really being driven not by what's plausible or ultimately helpful, but by what these powerful institutions see as something in their interest.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you've mentioned people in the 20s and 30s who were prominent in their time coming forward with groundbreaking tenets surrounding field theory and cell intelligence, but that was squashed by the evolving gene people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Classic embryology is where the field thinking really had its practical influence. In their experiments, someone demonstrated that you could take a part of an early embryo out, and the embryo would replace it. The cells weren't fixed; they could fill in for each other. You could move a cell from one place to another and its fate would be changed by where you put it. It could be developing along the line to become a foot, and putting it in another place, it could become a face.

Knowing that kind of field effect, one researcher took a tumor, cut off a tadpole's tail, and grafted the tumor on where the tail had been. The tumor was converted by the developmental field of the tadpole into a new tail. It's potentially a very useful way of looking at the organism: that cells are shaped by the inner environment as well as modifying the environment.

## Cell Intelligence and Light

**Andrew Murray:** I was pointed towards work done by Guenter Albrecht-Buehler in a paper called *Cell Intelligence*. He found that cells were displaying intelligence and would gravitate towards infrared light.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's quite a bit of evidence that light produced by the dividing and metabolizing cells is a signal. He's arguing for infrared as a very important signal. The Gurwitsches in the 1930s provided good evidence regarding ultraviolet frequency. They demonstrated that it could transmit mitogenic signals through quartz glass, but not through ordinary glass that would filter out ultraviolet. Albrecht-Buehler is currently one of the leading people. Fritz-Albert Popp in Germany has been another more recent one.

## Lactic Acid and Disease

**Andrew Murray:** How can field theory be applied to conditions like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and diabetes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Albrecht-Buehler sees fields as working both inside and outside the cell. The cell has to have a very organized meaning/interpretation system for knowing which set of genes to turn on and off in certain environments. Cells have to reach out and manipulate the environment around them, conditioning their surroundings to fit their needs.

The organism as a whole, running into stresses, can change that territory around the individual cells as well as the metabolism available to that cell. The metabolism is creating the structure—for example, collagen to restore and renew its environment is produced more under stress when lactic acid is present because there's not enough oxygen. Lactic acid turns on many of these reactive defensive processes that, as a signal to the organism, will tell the organism to deliver more oxygen, sugar, and nutrients to the cells.

But if the cell doesn't get what it needs from the rest of the organism, or if the field disrupting it is too intense—for example, ionizing radiation or intense radio frequency—it can keep the cell from maturing properly. If the organism can get the necessary materials to the cell, the cell can recover.

Lactic acid is one of the basic disrupting signals if it continues too long. It turns out that one of the basic features of diabetes is that they can't oxidize sugar all the way to carbon dioxide; instead, they produce lactic acid. Lactic acidosis is very often what diabetics used to die from. Any organ that's under too much stress and not getting repair materials will shift over to producing lactic acid. The lactic acid is a stress signal and an immune signal for the rest of the organism.

**Andrew Murray:** This reminds me of the lactic acid felt as a cramp during exercise. Is this the same lactic acid that is a destabilizer of the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A very well-developed athlete will not produce lactic acid too easily. A sedentary person who is forced to exercise will be flooded with lactic acid because they haven't developed the system for delivering oxygen and fuel to the tissues.

Carbon dioxide produced by healthy metabolism directly participates in suppressing lactic acid and in maintaining oxidative energy production. A place where you can see this is people who live at high altitudes. The balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide leaves their bodies having a higher residual carbon dioxide level. They can work very intensely without producing lactic acid. That's sometimes called the "Lactate Paradox," because ordinarily oxygen deficiency is what turns on lactic acid. But once you get adapted and are able to produce a lot of carbon dioxide or hold it in your tissues, that in itself prevents this toxic formation of lactic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this adaptation different to the red blood cell adaptation to altitude?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's part of it. The tissues themselves develop more mitochondria and the enzymes that regulate carbon dioxide shift. The red blood cell itself doesn't deliver all of its carbon dioxide. When it gets to the lungs, it picks up as much oxygen as it can, but at a lower oxygen pressure. That means the blood is still retaining a slightly higher amount of CO2.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think of lactate testing to ascertain if someone is under stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably the time that you're feeling the stress would be the best time to measure it. It's increasingly being used to diagnose cancer and monitor the progress. When the cancer is being regressed, the lactic acid in the serum goes down.

**Andrew Murray:** At what state of development of a tumor would lactic acid be increased?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It starts showing up in the blood at a very early stage. At a certain point, it causes an inactivation of the immune system that should be helping to correct the cancer.

Since everyone over the age of 50 has cells that can be diagnosed as cancer, it's a good idea not to be panicked by any measurement that could indicate cancer. If you ate something very disagreeable, your lactic acid would go up just from the general inflammation. You want to take everything in context. Even if it's being produced by a cancer, most cancers don't kill people. It's something that's naturally being cured spontaneously.

**Andrew Murray:** If carbon dioxide is analogous to an anti-lactate, what is the best method to raise this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything that keeps your free fatty acids from being released. Those are released by too much adrenaline. Many of the pituitary hormones help to increase the toxic free fatty acids. Everything you can do to lower the stress hormones helps. Aspirin, for example, is a good anti-inflammatory, anti-stress agent. Vitamin E is another protective. Ascorbic acid in ordinary foods provides abundant amounts, so I don't recommend that as a supplement in general.

**Andrew Murray:** This is why you're so big on orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and meat, eggs, milk—everything. Vegetables of all sorts contain ascorbic acid, but meat contains it in the dehydroascorbate form where people measuring the reduced form overlook it.

## Caller from Australia: Electromedicine and Ozone

**Caller:** I'm from Melbourne, Australia. My question is in relation to electromedicine, where George Lakhovsky and Royal Rife produced certain wavelengths to kill off pathogens. Also, Dr. Robert Beck and Hulda Clark have come up with a machine called the Zapper. Do those machines really work? And is there any health benefit to drinking ozonated water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There definitely is something to the principle, but I've never seen evidence that it is as specific as many of the people claim it to be. I know people who use apparatus of that sort, and I think it's acting probably as a stimulus rather than having that specific action that the Rifians claim for it.

Regarding ozonated water, I think ozone is too toxic in itself. The superoxide radical, which is produced by ionized air and some ionized water, can be beneficial as part of a detox system in the lungs, but I would be very careful with either ozone or peroxide-containing water.

## Lyme Disease Protocols

**Caller:** I had a question about an herbal protocol for Lyme disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a lot on the Internet suggesting that it's a lifetime project, but there's also quite a bit of information that says that two or three weeks with the right combination of antibiotics almost always cures it. I think it's good to look widely—get a second, third, and fourth opinion before you commit yourself to a very prolonged protocol.

**Andrew Murray:** How do you feel about the pathogen itself?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That class of bacteria, the spirochetes in general, can be very harsh. Some of them are very toxic and harmful and long-lasting. If you have any symptoms, it's good to check it and, if necessary, have the proper antibiotic treatment. But there are a lot of selling services; some doctors want to make it a many-year project of treatment recovery.

## Newborn Nutrition

**Andrew Murray:** The World Health Organization advocates four years of breastfeeding for newborn babies. What do you think would be the best possible start for a newborn in terms of nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Breastfeeding naturally, but with the mother well-fed, happy, and unstressed. When the mother is under stress or not properly nourished, the composition of the milk shows it. Good milk contains a lot of blood sugar converted into the lactose of the milk, hormones—some thyroid and progesterone—and a lot of immune factors. Even if a baby has an endocrine problem, as long as it's getting good milk, something like hypothyroidism often doesn't show up just because the milk is so rich in these protective factors.

## Caller from Salmon Creek: Lyme Follow-up

**Caller:** I'm local. You said Lyme disease takes a three-month protocol on antibiotics and that cures it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes it disappears in just two or three weeks.

**Caller:** I know a lot of people with Lyme disease and I've never seen that work that quickly. Is there some special protocol you're speaking of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can find several articles on PubMed that are very good. I think part of the problem that makes it seem so incurable is that it often is misdiagnosed. They recognize evidence of an infection, but they don't recognize any clear signs of improvement because in many cases the person just isn't eating right or has other passing things in their environment.

**Andrew Murray:** Just to interject, caller, more often than not when people test positive on an ELISA test for *Borrelia* antibodies, they have a lot of other metabolic defects. That is what causes people to be so sick. Especially with the protocols that are used—fairly heavy drugs—these can really play into someone's downfall. It's more of a failure of the organism under the barrage of drugs and chemicals to treat it.

**Caller:** Where in PubMed do I find this protocol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just look for *Borrelia* or Lyme disease and antibiotic treatment.

**Andrew Murray:** Every transaction that we make in this world with our bodies costs something. In terms of metabolic energy to fight disease or digest food, it all costs energy. That ATP has to be derived from something, so nutrition is extremely important. Most people can be chronically malnourished—maybe not to skin and bones, but malnourished by foods that are blocking thyroid function. If that's the case, it's very difficult to generate enough metabolic energy.

## Caller: Stages of Lyme

**Caller:** One of the things about Lyme disease that hasn't been addressed is that it's from a spirochete, which means it's similar to syphilis. Syphilis has a first, second, and third stage. I've heard that if you catch Lyme in the first or second stages, it can be cured with antibiotics, but if it goes into the third stage before it's treated, that's when it's really difficult.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what do you say about primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis in relation to *Borrelia*?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's probably analogous. The right antibiotic is needed to treat tertiary syphilis. Something that gets into the brain and nervous system will do it.

## Conclusion and References

**Andrew Murray:** We're getting to the top of the hour. I want to mention a few authors you've discussed so people can look them up. We mentioned Michael Polanyi, who has been dominant in field theory. And the Hungarian astrophysicist, Attila Grandpierre.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a video by Michael Persinger called *No More Secrets* that talks about some of the field interactions that Grandpierre is writing about. They're very interesting.

**Andrew Murray:** You also mentioned P.K. Anokhin as someone studying CO2 and the "acceptor of action."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that was an antecedent for cybernetics. He was a colleague and student of Pavlov, and he devised this cybernetic interpretation of reflexes which sees the model of the world that we have in our consciousness as determining how the reflex works. It makes a very simple way of interpreting other fields, such as Hans Selye's stress process, if you see it in terms of Anokhin's acceptor of action. The meaning of a particular stress and how the body is responding governs the field all the way down to the cell.

**Andrew Murray:** And then there was Noam Chomsky and William Blake.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blake saw things in a very holistic, cosmic way as well as very biological, soundly based in the organism.

**Andrew Murray:** And Dostoevsky's *Diary of a Writer*?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, about the essential meaningfulness of experience and reality.
