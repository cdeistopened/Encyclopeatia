## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, we run every third Friday of the month. Callers are invited to call in with questions related to the monthly topic or alternative questions for Dr. Peat. It is 2021; we are very happy to join you again for the first show of this year. I want to start by introducing Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for sharing your time again. For those who have never heard much about you, would you outline your academic and professional background before I begin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** After college, I spent several years studying and teaching linguistics, literature, and painting. In 1968, I decided to go to graduate school in biology for a PhD. I did my dissertation in 1972 on reproductive hormones and aging. The oxidative metabolism changes with aging have been one of my main themes ever since.

**Andrew Murray:** You've been actively involved in research surrounding progesterone and the process by which cellular breakdown occurs and aging proceeds. I know you spent the better part of 40 years researching and producing reference articles. Dr. Peat's website is [raypeat.com](http://raypeat.com).

## The Economic Impact of the Pandemic

**Andrew Murray:** I'm going to go in a certain direction this evening regarding the results of the last 12 months. We have seen this viral pandemic move across the globe with numerous repercussions—financial, economic, and social. The financial effect is something I want people to think about.

Most people listening know that Sarah and I are qualified naturopaths. We have degrees from England in alternative medicine and herbal medicine, and we are members of the European professional body, as well as the National Institute of Medical Herbalists. I spent 22 years as an active practitioner.

The pandemic has resulted in many things, one of which is the vaccine. I want to preface my questions by saying I am an unabashed Christian. We live in a spirit world, not a purely physical one. From a biblical perspective, we recognize the battle between good and evil and the inherent corruption in our world system. Banking is one of those main areas where power and corruption are held.

We aren't alarmists, but we look at the science. We've mentioned Bill Gates' ID2020 program and the industrialization of the last 40 or 50 years. This global pandemic, which you have said for months is not justified by the science, has a fear factor that has gripped the nations. Leaders are gripping citizens into a state of lockdowns and authoritarianism.

I want to mention the "implantable quantum dot microneedle vaccination delivery system." In alphanumerics, if you add up the numbers of that phrase, it adds up to 666. Bill Gates has also patented a human implantable device for buying and selling cryptocurrency with a patent number ending in 060606. I believe these are signs. This luciferase technology, which allows a visible light to be readable, is tied into the vaccine passport that will allow people to move about and work. It seems to be a takedown of the normal banking world.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think conspiracies are very important in this whole thing. People interested in the effect of conspiracies on history should investigate the fact that the foundations—Bill Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, World Economic Forum—were predicting this in great detail more than a year before. As far back as 10 years previously, but specifically in 2019, they were detailing the need to destroy the present economy of small and medium-sized businesses. They called that the "legacy economy"—the economy to be put to rest to allow a digital economy run by artificial intelligence to take over.

They had to destroy the existing economies of the world, especially the United States, arguing it was to make headway against China. But replacing the real economy with a digital economy was a real conspiracy. It has caused horrible destruction, with people losing their careers and livelihoods. As a result, in the first year, the billionaires have profited by hundreds of billions of dollars. For example, Amazon has become practically a necessity for many people to do their shopping, just as predicted by the conspirators in 2019. Eric Schmidt said it would be the "aesthetically satisfying" way to do your shopping, but we have no choice when they destroy the businesses. It is like a conspiracy to commit the biggest robbery in history. You don't have to do much investigation; you can find out what the World Economic Forum, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Klaus Schwab were writing. They were great predictors because it was a conspiracy.

## Vaccine Definitions and Delivery Systems

**Andrew Murray:** I was staggered to see the patents pulled out by the Microsoft Corporation for this implantable quantum dot microneedle vaccination delivery system. Everything we've witnessed in the last 12 months has been right in your face.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen any statement put out by the government regarding either the vaccine or the pandemic which is true. If they had a real vaccine, a method of delivering viral RNA doesn't meet the government's own definition of a vaccine.

However, if they did have a vaccine, intradermal delivery would be the only biological basis for using a vaccine to create immunity. For example, the smallpox vaccine was given intradermally for thousands of years. When the World Health Organization decided to eliminate the disease, they used a strategy to surround the virus outbreaks and vaccinate the exposed people in a tighter and tighter circle until the disease no longer existed. That was done by intradermal introduction of antigens. That meets the definition of a vaccine.

That was the only time the government used a vaccine intelligently to eliminate a disease. But terminating a disease wasn't economically interesting to drug companies. They have directed the vaccination culture away from using it logically. Intradermal vaccination approaches the immune system in one of the three ways we normally encounter disease: by inhalation, swallowing, or having it rubbed into the skin.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, if they were delivering viral particles in a vaccine scraped into the skin—like the smallpox vaccine—that would be a much safer, more logical approach?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. That involves the thymus cells and many other types of cells along the way. Those can take care of exposure to infectious particles without needing to activate the B-cell antibody production. Antibody production is activated by estrogen or extreme deprivation of energy. You can induce antibodies in a very sick, old person, but you haven't necessarily done anything for the real immune system—the innate immunity that starts with your skin, bowel, or respiratory membranes.

Once you produce antibodies against a particular disease, you open the way to create autoimmunity because the antibody recognizes a combination of your own tissue and the infectious antigen. If you continue to have lower biological energy, such as under the influence of estrogen rather than progesterone, estrogen profoundly increases the odds of having an autoimmune disease.

## Fetal Cells and Contamination

**Andrew Murray:** Let's talk about vaccines known to contain fetal cells. This raises ethical questions about the source of these cells and why we are injecting them into our bodies.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any living cell, human or otherwise, can be infected without producing symptoms. It can be infected with dozens or hundreds of viruses. If you use monkey cells at any point in the process of making a vaccine, you could be introducing a monkey virus. The polio vaccine infected millions with the cancer-producing Simian Virus 40 (SV40). That wasn't known until someone discovered it because they didn't think to look for it. You would have to do PCR tests for thousands of potential diseases to know the vaccine was not going to give you SV40, for example.

## Luciferase and Patch Technology

**Andrew Murray:** Let's move on to the technology of luciferase. It is an apt name for what seems to be a "mark of the beast" type of creation. Luciferase is the name of the enzyme, reminiscent of Lucifer, the "bearer of light." Would you like to comment on this technology?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If they are using it with patch technology to put it into the skin intradermally, that is one tremendous virtue. Anything you inject—antibiotic, vitamin, or vaccine—creates an exposure the organism never knew in any significant quantity until the hypodermic needle was invented. Doctors monopolized this, claiming traditional oral or transdermal remedies were primitive and that active drugs had to be injected intravenously or intramuscularly.

Intramuscular introduction of all kinds of dirt, junk, and antigens became common. Paralytic polio wasn't known until right after the introduction of hypodermic needles. The breakout of paralytic polio coincided remarkably with campaigns to vaccinate for anything, simply infecting large populations intramuscularly. If a person developed polio, it was usually in the arm or leg where they received the injection. Animal studies showed that regardless of the real infection, the paralysis consistently appeared most often in the limb where they received the intramuscular injection.

Shifting to a patch would probably reduce the death rate from all sorts of related causes. But the luciferase/luciferin protein is sort of devilish, extraneous matter. It's entirely separate from the biological involvement of the immune system. It's just entertainment for the World Health Organization or the CDC, making it easier for them to track people.

## Adverse Reactions and Censorship

**Andrew Murray:** Anyone with children can attest to the massive numbers of vaccinations children are now required to have—up to about 50 now in multiple rounds. We've mentioned fetal cells and polyethylene glycol (PEG), which has been associated with idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Several people have died as a result recently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And Pfizer immediately said there is no known connection between vaccination and that particular killing of the platelet system. Several people have pointed out that the government lists that as one of their categories for compensating vaccination damage.

**Andrew Murray:** There is an increasingly chilling effect on free speech regarding reporting adverse events. If there was free access to this information, we would hear much more. The internet is becoming a directed tool; browsing is channeled. Dr. Peat, you mentioned that when you were studying, you physically went to university libraries to dig through volumes, but as time went on, it became harder to retrieve these.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Books I read in the 1950s had disappeared by 1965. In the 1980s, when they started using computer databases, the science librarian asked me to check how reliable the computers were. I had been looking at the print version of *Biological Abstracts*. I gave her specific references I found on paper, and she couldn't find them on the computerized databases. As soon as *Biological Abstracts* went digital, someone was "improving" it by deleting controversial subjects.

In the 1990s, I went back to the library and asked what happened to the tiers of volumes of *Biological Abstracts* and *Chemical Abstracts*. They said they had been put into storage. I asked for access, and they said they were in unlabeled boxes. Functionally, they had burned a large part of the science library.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** In 2005, Anthony Fauci promoted hydroxychloroquine as a cure for coronaviruses. Now you don't hear about cures like Losartan, Ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine, nor the herbs effective at treating flu.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In May of last year, two of the most prestigious medical journals—*The Lancet* was the most shocking—rushed to print an article just after Trump mentioned he was recommending hydroxychloroquine. They based their study on a database of supposedly 95,000 cases, claiming hydroxychloroquine tremendously increased the death rate. When people asked for information about this miraculous database, they found the company that supposedly created it consisted of two or three people with nothing to do with biological research. The whole 95,000 cases were made up out of thin air.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How long did it take *The Lancet* to retract it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When people started pointing it out, the editor-in-chief said it's not his business to make sure the article is true.

## Caller: Chickenpox and Shingles

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller from Arizona.

**Caller:** When I was five or six, I had a very mild case of chickenpox. Now the vast majority of children are vaccinated. Is society actually harmed by not allowing children to have mild diseases like chickenpox?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there is evidence that they are more likely to have cancer, for example, if they don't get chickenpox.

**Caller:** Older people are marketed the shingles vaccine, and I guess it only works for about five years before it wears off.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, what about reactivated chickenpox and shingles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Your whole body is your immune system. If you keep it healthy with adequate vitamin D, calcium, and keeping all your hormones away from the stress axis, you aren't going to have those reactivations.

**Caller:** Lastly, Dr. Peat, you once mentioned a study in Central America with three villages: one fully vaccinated, one control, and one that got clean water and nutritional supplements. Do you remember that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That was a series of studies over five or ten years. That particular article was in *Nutrition Reviews*. I read it in the late 1970s. It was organized under the World Health Organization.

## Xylitol and Artificial Sweeteners

**Michael (Engineer):** I have a question related to diet and immune health. What do you think about artificial sweeteners, and specifically, what about xylitol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything that interferes with your energy production—especially oxidative energy using glucose—is going to impair your immune reactions.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you think xylitol could be potentially immunosuppressive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think some of the artificial sweeteners have been shown to be.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I know there is research supporting xylitol for preventing dental caries. I’ve tried xylitol tooth gel on my children, and they report a stomach ache if they swallow it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's from an interference with energy production properly from glucose.

**Michael (Engineer):** I know there are different types of fake sweeteners. Xylitol is an alcohol, whereas NutraSweet is a protein. It's found hidden everywhere.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Honey is nature's finest sweetener.

## Data Transparency and Censorship

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, a British Medical Journal editor looked at a tiny amount of data released by Pfizer. It suggests the vaccine is between 19% and 29% effective, not the 90% plus they claim.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pfizer released a microscopic amount of data which still gave away some of their secrets. They released it in a favorable, cheerleading way. The *New England Journal of Medicine* editor, who had no special knowledge about viruses, wrote an editorial praising it. The Pfizer authors were talking around the actual data, which they are hiding. The vast bulk of their data is secret. The public has been trained to accept authority instead of science. If you don't let out the data your statements are based on, they should be considered religious or philosophical opinions, having nothing to do with science.

**Andrew Murray:** Very briefly, thoughts on vaccine passports as a control mechanism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The average age of people dying from supposedly COVID is nearly exactly the same as the average age of total death, which would mean the virus has essentially nothing to do with the age of death.

**Andrew Murray:** Wake up to the vaccine passport before you can move around and do business. That sounds like the final nail in the coffin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They hope it is. But I think if more people look at the questioning articles—there is a good article by Genevieve Briand of Johns Hopkins University regarding the death numbers. Her article was censored as soon as authorities noticed it.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We don't have time for more. I want to round up the show by saying that the Constitution and the amendments protecting free speech are rapidly eroding. But there is still plenty of hope. For those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, truth is self-evident. We are World Wide Web connected, so everyone has the opportunity to see what is going on.

Happy New Year. We should be back in March if we don't do this again in February. Thanks for listening.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** To end on a positive note, the day length is getting longer and we are heading to spring. Thank you for listening.
