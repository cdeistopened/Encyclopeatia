## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, recommending herbal medicine and dietary advice.

This month we are going to have Dr. Raymond Peat on the show to talk about various subjects, including hair loss, inflammation, and osteoporosis. But first, we have Kevin Peer on the line. Kevin has studied hypnotherapy and is opening a Lyme disease forum in the Humboldt area.

## Lyme Disease Support Group

**Andrew Murray:** Kevin, sorry for the technical difficulties. You are creating a Lyme support group, is that correct?

**Kevin Peer:** That is correct.

**Andrew Murray:** Will that be for Humboldt County or the surrounding area?

**Kevin Peer:** It will be for the surrounding area. It is going to take place at my office at the AEE building in Redway.

**Andrew Murray:** What is the purpose of the Lyme support group?

**Kevin Peer:** The purpose is to give people an opportunity to meet others who are in the same boat, dealing with the challenges and mysteries of Lyme disease. One thing I consistently hear—and experienced myself when I was in the throes of Lyme disease—is that people who don't have it don't really want to hear about it. They are confused by it or wonder if the person is being a hypochondriac because the symptoms are mysterious, perplexing, and change from day to day. People have told me it would be great to have a place where they can talk about this and nobody is going to think they are crazy.

**Andrew Murray:** How are you going to advertise it?

**Kevin Peer:** Wednesday, August 3rd, will be the first meeting. For people interested in taking part, they should give me a call so I can get a sense of what they want to experience in the group. My phone number is 986-7469. They can also contact me through my email: kevin@inneralliancecounseling.com.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What can participants expect besides expressing their symptoms?

**Kevin Peer:** It will be a listening platform for people to share experiences, but also a place to gain information. Myself and guest speakers will present information on the latest treatment modalities in both conventional and alternative medicine. We will talk about how Lyme disease affects various organ systems and hormones, and what you need to be thinking of in terms of diet—basically how to untangle the puzzle of Lyme disease.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Will you be discussing how hypnotherapy can help?

**Kevin Peer:** During the last 20 minutes of each meeting, I'm going to offer an in-depth, relaxing, guided healing meditation geared around helping to activate the immune system.

**Andrew Murray:** Are you going to be charging for this?

**Kevin Peer:** There will be a nominal fee, probably $5, just to help defray the cost of gas. Nobody will be turned away for financial reasons.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you, Kevin, for your time tonight.

## Dr. Raymond Peat: Background and Hormones

**Andrew Murray:** We have Dr. Raymond Peat on the line. Dr. Peat, for those tuning in for the first time, would you please let people know about your academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied biology at the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology, especially reproductive physiology, and quite a bit of biochemistry. I consider myself an old-fashioned biologist—pre-molecular biology in my way of thinking. My dissertation was on the effects of hormones on oxidative metabolism in relation to the aging of the reproductive system.

**Andrew Murray:** We wanted to discuss hair loss and the mechanism behind it. I know male pattern baldness is often attributed to genetics and testosterone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The head of the dermatology department where we trained in London was convinced that male pattern baldness was caused by a sensitivity to testosterone, or DHT. Dr. Peat, how do you explain why males develop baldness? Is it due to testosterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the belief in testosterone as the cause is similar to the old belief that males got prostate cancer because of testosterone. Since males get a particular kind of baldness, it's easy to blame it on testosterone. But in fact, there is no evidence showing that excess testosterone is responsible for it, any more than excess testosterone causes prostate cancer. The idea of "increased sensitivity" came in because there was no evidence of too much of the hormone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. When they measured blood levels, the testosterone levels were not important, so they assumed cellular sensitivity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That fills in for a lack of evidence. When you look at the actual hormone situation of people with lots of hair versus those with not much, you see an excess of prolactin and cortisol in the people losing their hair—both men and women. Testosterone actually makes the hair shaft grow thicker and faster. Prolactin tends to cause it to fall out. In birds, prolactin is known as the molting hormone. In humans, it is the milk-producing hormone, but it also regulates practically every other cell in the body. It has the analogous function of terminating the growth cycle of the hair shaft.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, cortisol and prolactin both rise during stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is clear evidence they are associated. What links those is low energy production—a thyroid deficiency tendency—letting the metabolism of cholesterol go down towards increased cortisol, and less towards progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA, which are things that promote hair growth.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If men suffering from baldness checked their blood levels, would they see higher than normal prolactin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It wouldn't likely be "higher than normal" on the current lab standards, because they have increased the upper limit of the range. This is probably because of the population's exposure to estrogens. Estrogen increases the production of prolactin, and estrogen itself terminates the growth of hair.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Didn't you say that in the past, the ideal range was lower?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Back in the 70s, they found the healthy range for women was around 12 to 15, and for men, it was about 4 to 7. They've now raised the upper limit for men sometimes as high as 20. But all the men I've talked to who had levels close to 20—even though they were told they were normal—had developing breasts, or gynecomastia. Fertility is best when a man has a level of 4 to 7.

## Estrogen, Hops, and Environmental Factors

**Andrew Murray:** Speaking of gynecomastia, that is not an uncommon sight in heavy drinkers of very hoppy beer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's not only the phytoestrogens from the hops, but the yeast required for alcoholic drinks. Yeast produces estradiol, the powerful human hormone.

**Andrew Murray:** Interestingly enough, hop extract is the latest miticide for the bee industry.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Female hop pickers are notoriously known to stop menstruating because of the high level of hormones they are exposed to through their skin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The hormones in beer, and to a lesser extent in wine, along with the estrogen from the yeast, will stimulate the adrenals to produce both estrogen and cortisol. Cortisol makes the big belly, and the estrogens contribute to breast growth.

**Andrew Murray:** What about the oral contraceptive pill and its presence in the water supply? Is that a credible source of environmental estrogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. You can identify the specific type of estrogen and progestin from the fields going right through the sewer processing plants into the rivers. It causes fish, muskrats, and anything living in the rivers to be feminized.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is there a filter that takes those compounds out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nothing practical that is in use. If you are going to drink the water, you should run it over activated carbon. Ozone is probably the cheapest, best method for municipalities because it breaks down chemicals like that.

## Stress Hormones and Cholesterol

**Andrew Murray:** Back to the connection between hair loss and hormones. You mentioned cortisol and prolactin are stress hormones that decrease hair growth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They go up with stress. Prolactin responds to different kinds of stress; for example, anything that blocks your thyroid function and energy production tends to increase prolactin.

**Andrew Murray:** I know you speak often about the innate energy level within an organism being responsible for health. You mention thyroid as the driver of cellular respiration.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your thyroid is low, or if your cholesterol is below average, or if you are deficient in vitamin A, you can't efficiently turn cholesterol into progesterone and the other anti-stress hormones. The emergency anti-stress hormone is cortisol. If you lower your cholesterol with a drug, that forces you to increase reliance on cortisol, which will have degenerative effects, including interference with hair growth.

**Andrew Murray:** This is why statin drugs have degenerative side effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you poison the production of cholesterol, you are also poisoning Coenzyme Q10 and many other metabolic systems.

**Andrew Murray:** You are an advocate of having a reasonably good level of cholesterol because it is a building block for steroid hormones.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Framingham study found that people over 50 who don't have at least 200 mg% of cholesterol are much more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. It is brain-protective to have over 200. Thyroid will lower cholesterol naturally by producing more of the protective hormones: progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA.

## Practical Solutions for Hair Loss

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can we talk about practical applications? What can people buy to help hair grow back?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D is closely involved in hair development. Also, getting enough calcium in your diet.

**Andrew Murray:** How does Vitamin D work?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Vitamin D receptor is a regulatory material in practically every cell in the body, including bones and hair. The receptor itself is involved in making stem cells that produce new hairs. A couple of groups have discovered that if you inhibit the parathyroid hormone, you can increase hair growth. The natural inhibitors of the parathyroid hormone are Vitamin D and calcium.

**Andrew Murray:** Parathyroid is inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It interrupts the use of oxygen. It is essentially an anti-thyroid function. Thyroid enables you to use oxygen; parathyroid hormone can do useful things like shocking your bones into producing more cartilage by interfering with oxygen production for a moment. But if you keep your parathyroid hormone up continuously, you destroy the bone because it doesn't have enough energy to build.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So people can make sure to get lots of calcium—up to 2,000 milligrams a day—and Vitamin D from sunshine. What else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin A intake helps hold down parathyroid hormone. You want to avoid everything that suppresses thyroid function, such as polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oils).

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And get plenty of coconut oil. Vitamin A is found in liver and eggs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the last couple of years, some people have found that topical thyroid hormone (T3) applied to the skin stimulates regeneration. Caffeine, which has some overlapping effects with thyroid hormone, is now being added to lotions to renew hair growth.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Would coffee or tea work if you applied it topically?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm sure the caffeine would work, but it's cleaner to use pure caffeine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** You also mentioned making an oil rub with natural progesterone, DHEA, and olive oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, those regenerate many skin functions, including hair growth.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So, a little olive oil, 25mg of DHEA, and 50mg of natural progesterone mixed together?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen several people do it. If you have hair to start with, it is a sticky mess to put on your scalp every day. That is why caffeine is neater.

## Caller Q&A: Yohimbe and Bulimia

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take our first caller.

**Caller:** I was wondering about estrogenics from plants versus testosteronics. Does the Yohimbe plant or yohimbine act as a hormone? Are there any natural testosterone sources in plants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know of any plants that have a testosterone-like action. There are some chemicals that test like progesterone in plants, but I've never seen an actual biological effect from them.

**Andrew Murray:** We have a question from a listener regarding a female ex-bulimic who recovered about a year ago and started experiencing hair loss immediately after.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect it led to hypothyroidism. There is usually high prolactin and high serotonin during those appetite disturbances. It probably started because of hypothyroidism, but at a certain point, hair can start falling when the thyroid is really low and the stress hormones are high.

## Female Hair Growth and Graying

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I'd like to talk about unwanted female hair growth, or hirsutism. What is going on with hormones there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The androgens are usually up, but prolactin excess is also involved. Both hirsutism and hair loss are associated with high prolactin. A thyroid supplement is a very reliable way to control prolactin in most women. Vitamin A and calcium also help.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** From an herbal point of view, Vitex (Chase Tree Berry) blocks prolactin.

**Andrew Murray:** How about graying hair?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen DHEA correct it pretty quickly. However, the enzyme that creates the melanin pigment uses copper as a catalyst. Probably the best food for increasing your copper—while decreasing the iron which competes against it—is shellfish. Shrimp, clams, lobster, crab, and squid all have high copper content.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Since I started eating a serving of shellfish once a week three years ago, I haven't noticed any new gray hairs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since iron accumulates with aging, if a person eats foods high in iron, like meat or liver, it is helpful to have coffee at the same time so you don't absorb all the iron. Iron attacks polyunsaturated fats and tends to increase serotonin. This chronic oxidation of polyunsaturated fats interacting with iron and estrogen forms lipofuscin (age spots).

## Osteoporosis and Calcium

**Andrew Murray:** I want to ask about osteoporosis. We hear about calcium and brittle bones, but what is your interpretation of the cause?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My current interest is that it is a good way to conceive the unified nature of aging processes. Everyone's bones get thinner with aging, which corresponds to the loss of muscle tissue and the calcification of soft tissues. This is associated with the misapplication of calcium—failing to put it in the bones. All of that is under the control of energy metabolism. When thyroid and oxidative metabolism fail, the parathyroid, lactic acid-producing metabolism replaces it, causing stress atrophy.

**Andrew Murray:** So it is an error of calcium metabolism. What kind of calcium intake is reasonable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Maasai people and other cattle-raising people often get 5,000 mg of calcium a day.

**Andrew Murray:** And this is from milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There has been publicity about calcium supplements not being helpful. The most popular medical supplements have been calcium citrate or lactate. Citric acid itself causes you to lose calcium in your urine. Those supplements have anti-calcification effects.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They advertise calcium citrate as the only absorbable form, but you are saying it inhibits absorption?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It activates the loss of calcium. Calcium carbonate isn't quite as soluble, but eventually, it has a chance to absorb. It is a very effective and safe supplement because the carbon dioxide is the form that stimulates bone formation rather than breaking it down.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** An easy way to get that is eggshell powder. A quarter teaspoon of finely ground eggshell powder is about 2,000 mg of calcium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chemical analyses comparing eggshells to commercial supplements find that the lowest concentration of toxic heavy metals is in eggshells. Oyster shells are the next cleanest. Old cows used for bone meal often have high lead content.

**Andrew Murray:** So calcium in the form of eggshells is excellent.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And aspirin. People seldom talk about it, but aspirin improves calcium retention in bones. It isn't as profitable as osteoporosis drugs like bisphosphonates, but it is very safe as long as you take Vitamin K with it. Vitamin K protects your arteries from calcification and allows the bone to use carbon dioxide to bind calcium into the bone.

**Andrew Murray:** What are food sources for Vitamin K?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Kale is the richest vegetable, and liver is a very rich source. A serving of well-cooked kale every other day should provide enough.

**Andrew Murray:** Calcification of the arteries is common, and people think they should avoid calcium, but that is counterintuitive. Consuming adequate calcium drives parathyroid hormone down and deposits calcium in the correct location.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Also, recently, researchers noticed that people taking SSRI antidepressants were getting osteoporosis. They see that serotonin—produced mostly in the intestine—interferes with bone metabolism. Now they are developing drugs to suppress serotonin synthesis to cure osteoporosis.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, we have to cut it short there. Thank you so much for joining us.
