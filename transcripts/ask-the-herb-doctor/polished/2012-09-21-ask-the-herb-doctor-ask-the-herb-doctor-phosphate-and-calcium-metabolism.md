## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows before, they run every third Friday of the month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM. We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in Herbal Medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts.

You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of phosphate and calcium metabolism. Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show to share his wisdom.

This is the day before the first day of fall 2012. Tomorrow, September 22nd, is the autumnal equinox. Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** As usual, there are people who have just turned the radio on, perhaps have never heard your voice or don't know anything about you. Would you please give us a rundown of your academic and professional career?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been interested in nutrition for many years. Between 1968 and 1972, I studied biology at the University of Oregon, concentrating on the chemistry and physiology of aging, especially the reproductive system. That got me interested in many related processes.

Before I went to graduate school, I lived in Mexico and was interested in the economics of nutrition and how to optimize good nutrition on a minimum income. I saw that the ancient Indian civilization had made some great technological advances in processing corn. Corn normally has quite a few toxins in it, but they discovered that cooking it with lime—calcium hydroxide—made it more edible and less toxic. The traditional diet there was extremely rich in calcium, just as part of the tortilla and other processed corn.

That turns out to be something that's increasingly of interest to the biochemists of aging. In the last five or ten years, phosphate had sort of been ignored for about a hundred years in biology because it was like water to a fish—it's always there. The inorganic form of it is usually just considered the raw material from which you activate proteins or form adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-containing molecule. But recently, inorganic phosphate itself is turning out to be very central to all metabolic processes.

## Phosphate, Corn, and Nixtamalization

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So how were the South Americans making the lime? Were they just mining limestone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You burn limestone, soak it in water, and cook your corn in basically almost pure calcium hydroxide. That partly makes soap out of the fatty acids, removing the toxic unsaturated fats which interfere with hormones. It also changes some of the amino acids. Ordinary corn tends to have too much leucine, which contributes to toxic symptoms, and is normally deficient in some vitamins. It happens that the lime process converts tryptophan to niacin. It's like a niacin vitamin supplement. That's why the nutritional diseases that occurred in the U.S. southern states among people who lived largely on corn never occurred in the traditional Indian cultures.

**Andrew Murray:** You've warned against tryptophan as being a potentially harmful product.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the process of turning it to niacin happens to be very important in regulating phosphate, which otherwise would be one of the toxic features of any grain. Cereals, beans, and seeds of any sort have a very high ratio of phosphorus to calcium. So they're not only adding calcium, but they're giving a means for regulating your phosphate more perfectly because niacin happens to be an anti-phosphate nutrient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Is there a recipe that they follow, or is it pretty much trial and error when they take dried corn and boil it with some lime?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The recipe seems to be a big kettle full of corn and a big spoonful of lime. Cook it until the shells pop off the corn—the little transparent husk loosens as the corn kernel swells up and becomes hominy. When it looks like hominy, you stir it a little to separate the cellulose husks. Traditionally, they would let it stand in that liquid for a day to make sure the process is complete.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you be able to do a similar thing with fire ashes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That probably is better for some of the nutrients, and it makes a very delicious product. *Corunda* is one of the tamale-like foods made with ashes instead of calcium.

**Andrew Murray:** I picked up on what you said about the fatty acids. This is like saponification in soap making. You said that the fatty acids that are normally something you want to keep down are actually esterified by the process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is like a soapy solution that they pour off.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When I was visiting the mountains of Mexico and watching them make their different corn preparations, they used ashes for a certain type of product and lime for different types. They were very specific that the ashes were only for certain types.

## Sources of Phosphate and Aging

**Andrew Murray:** The main thrust of where we want to go with the topic this evening is inorganic phosphate and how prevalent it's become in today's commercial food industry. Can you talk a little bit about the age-related changes that occur with inorganic phosphate consumption and where the bulk of people's inorganic phosphate is coming from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main sources are meat, seeds, beans, nuts, and whole wheat—much more than refined white flour or white polished rice. Those have the germ removed, and the germ contains most of the phosphate. It sounds funny to say that white rice and white bread have advantages, but nutritionally they do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They also don't have the PUFA, the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And other toxins as well. The vegetable source of calcium that has the least phosphate would be leaves. Since cows naturally prefer to eat a lot of leaves, cow's milk has a very good ratio of calcium to phosphorus.

**Andrew Murray:** What kind of ratio would you be looking at as a good ratio?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk and cheese are about 1.3 to 1 [calcium to phosphorus]. Human milk is much better. I think if cows weren't given grain supplements, their milk would have an even higher ratio.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So do you think a grass-fed cow is going to be producing milk with lower phosphate levels than a grain-fed cow?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. A lot of people habitually eat a ratio of roughly five, six, or seven times as much phosphate as calcium. You probably shouldn't exceed about two parts of phosphate for each calcium. If you stick to a mostly milk and cheese-centered diet for your proteins, you'll stay close to a one-to-one ratio.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We were talking earlier about how many milligrams of calcium is in what you recommend for a daily amount of milk. If someone had three pints of milk a day, they'd get 2,000 milligrams of calcium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a quart, you get somewhere around 1,200 to 1,250 of calcium and just under a thousand of phosphate. So in a quart and a half, you'd have around one and a half grams of phosphate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And how much meat would be the maximum amount you want to eat per day? Or grains and legumes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably something like half a pound would be tolerable.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And if you wanted to put some eggs and cheese in there, then maybe a little less than half a pound.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You have to displace one phosphate source with the other.

**Andrew Murray:** I want to make sure listeners are aware that we're not anti-vegetarian, neither are we pro-meat eating, because they all have their benefits and costs. In terms of the phosphate load, meats are a fairly high source of phosphate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the calcium in meat is very low, as high as 10 to 1 for phosphate over calcium.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you describe the cellular aging effects of phosphate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the last few years, a strange mutant mouse was discovered. They named it *Klotho*, for a Greek fate. This mutant mouse aged very rapidly and had most of the features of human aging, such as decreased lung function, respiratory failure, hardening of the arteries, osteoporosis, wrinkling of the skin, and calcification generally—deposition of calcium phosphate where it shouldn't be, while taking it out of the bones where it should be.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So excess dietary phosphate is one of the factors involved in aging of many different organs and disease processes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And a lack of nutrients such as niacin, which help to get it out of the body and keep it from being absorbed so freely.

## Industrial Phosphate in Meat

**Andrew Murray:** Say a little bit about the industrialized food production and the inorganic phosphate that's used in the production of foods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was probably in the 60s when the government started regulating the adulteration of meats. They had been simply adding salt water in huge amounts. They started regulating how much water they could put in meat and defining the chemicals that could be used. It turned out that phosphate—various forms like polyphosphate and phosphate salts—were effective for making meat hold more water. Once that was approved, it became very standard.

All of the things you buy in delicatessens are likely to be hydrated. Ham now, unless you have it specially made, is going to be hydrated with something like 15% extra weight. They charge for it as if it's all meat, which makes it much more profitable.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And diapers underneath pieces of meat in grocery stores are usually very waterlogged.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They can give these chemicals to animals and cause them to have edema at the time they slaughter them. That counts as the starting weight, then they can add 15% beyond that. So if you have very edematous animals, your meat is even more profitable.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Fresh meat that's untreated does not leak water. You were mentioning that it's hard to fry a steak anymore because you put it in the pan and it ends up being boiled steak.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 50s, I liked to have fried ham with eggs for breakfast. But starting in the 60s, I found that I couldn't get anything but boiled ham. Put it on the frying pan and it just fills up the pan with water. This generally means that you're getting a tremendous extra amount of phosphate.

## Balancing Calcium and Phosphate

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Let's talk a little bit about the best sources of calcium to balance this phosphate.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In plant materials, leaves really are a great source of calcium. Turnip greens, for example, have about 10 times as much calcium as phosphate. Others not quite as much. But then you have to choose your leaves according to the toxins that you want to minimize. The cabbage family is anti-thyroid. All leaves have a fairly high unsaturated fat content, which can interfere with protein digestion. If you can process the leaves ideally, you can get very good nutrition out of them—high protein and high calcium. Otherwise, milk and cheese are pretty much the alternative sources, unless you want to grind up eggshells. That's basically pure calcium carbonate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I also like to recommend nettle leaf steeped overnight because it has quite a lot of calcium. I think it's like 1,000 milligrams per half cup of leaves soaked in a quart of water.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you boil any of these leaves, turnip leaves for example, you can just boil them quickly, get out most of the calcium [into the water], and then throw away the leaf and have a good supplement.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And I know you've mentioned that baking soda added to chard and spinach helps to block the oxalic acid and to release the minerals from the cellulose fibers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It happens that baking soda has some of the same benefits that niacinamide has. It helps your body to excrete phosphate more easily. Anything that helps your body make carbon dioxide helps to excrete phosphate. Salt and calcium happen to stimulate the production of carbon dioxide. So foods that are high in calcium and moderate in sodium will help to get rid of any excess phosphate.

## Calcium Deficiency and Calcification

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to continue talking about the link between calcification—which can occur in the vessels or tissues—and kidney disease that can come about as a result of phosphate overload. What do you say to people who want to maintain a healthy ratio?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of doctors for years have recommended cutting down on your calcium intake to avoid calcification. They know that calcium excites cells, so they say cut down calcium if you have seizures or high blood pressure. But it turns out that's a whole aspect of calcium that has been neglected.

If you are deficient in calcium, you tend to get cramps, seizures, bronchial spasms, and asthma. The lack of calcium excites tissues, turns on the excitotoxic mediators, triggers inflammation, and sets up the conditions for depositing calcium. When you're low in calcium in your diet, you're increasing the parathyroid hormone (PTH) to take calcium out of your bones to make up for what you're not eating. The parathyroid hormone releases serotonin and histamine, causing more inflammation and more calcification of the tissues—arteries, kidneys, brain cells—everywhere except the bones.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So a calcium-deficient diet is really associated with a lot of different inflammation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the tone of the small arteries is very responsive to calcium. If you're low in calcium, your blood pressure goes up. For about 30 years, David McCarron has been saying it's not sodium that causes high blood pressure, it's calcium deficiency. Eating extra calcium can often cure hypertension.

## The Fat-Free Diet and Metabolism

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things that got me interested in phosphate was looking at the fat-free diet that George Burr and his group did in the 1930s. Another group, William Brown, went on a six-month fat-free diet. His diet consisted of nothing but a total of 2,500 calories a day, made up basically of sugar syrup for several meals, and for supper, fat-free cottage cheese with a small potato starch biscuit, an apple, and half an orange.

**Andrew Murray:** Basically a sugar and milk diet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A gallon total of milk, some of it made into cottage cheese. He had chronically had lifelong migraine headaches every week, experienced food fatigue at the end of the day, had hypertension (150 over 100), cholesterol was 250, and he was about 10 pounds overweight.

A few months into the sugar and milk diet, his cholesterol had come down about 50 points, his weight stabilized about 10 pounds lower, his blood pressure came down to normal, and he never again had migraine headaches. One of the things they kept talking about was that, surprisingly, at the end of the workday, he wasn't tired.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the fat-free diet was actually good for him.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was a high calcium diet, essentially, with that ratio of 1.3 to 1 of calcium to phosphorus.

Several years ago, a group at the Linus Pauling Institute wrote a review on avoiding fructose. They cited a study where men were put on a diet emphasizing sugar—decaffeinated Coke with high fructose corn syrup was the main carbohydrate. Knowing that humans require 400 milligrams of magnesium every day, they put these men on 165 milligrams to prove that a fructose diet would cause derangement of mineral metabolism.

In fact, it did, but in a surprising way. On a magnesium-deficient diet, these men went into a positive magnesium balance, meaning their body was retaining extra magnesium and calcium like they were growing. But the derangement caused by the phosphate was a slight loss of phosphate every day. I think only if they were turning over their bones could you account for increasing calcium and magnesium while losing phosphate. Young bone is formed from carbon dioxide and calcium, making calcium carbonate, which is then replaced with phosphate during aging. So they were losing phosphate while gaining magnesium and calcium. I think that meant that they were building new bone.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that was on a high fructose diet.

## Caller: Arthritis and Stiffness

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this first caller.

**Caller:** Yes, I'm aging, and my biggest concern is arthritis—stiffness in the joints and in the back. I'm not too sure what kind of diet I should be doing. I was wondering whether the good doctor could give me some advice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Reducing the phosphate intake or getting a good ratio, ideally not much over 2 to 1 in relation to calcium, is important. That closely relates to thyroid. The polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), which interfere with thyroid function and steroid function—they interfere with progesterone production, for example—happen to also lower calcium in the blood. So when you're under stress, your calcium goes down and tends to deposit specifically because of the increased free fatty acids. Cutting down the unsaturated fats in the diet will help to improve your calcium ratio and your thyroid function.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** An equivalent of three pints of milk a day would provide 2,000 milligrams of calcium. Or a couple of glasses of milk with some eggshell powder, oyster shell powder, or boiled greens. Trying to get to about 2,000 milligrams of calcium would be a good start. Keep your whole grains, beans, or meat to not more than 8 ounces a day. Another thing is eggshell powder; if you take a quarter teaspoon three times a day with meals, that's about 2,000 milligrams.

## Caller: Organic vs. Inorganic Phosphate

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, recommendations have recently been coming out that phosphate be lowered as an additive in food. Do you think industry is listening to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they will find some other way to make meat weigh more. I'm afraid one of those might be the gluey substances such as carrageenan or gums. That's already in practice where they take waste fragments of meat or fish, add a jelly such as carrageenan or alginate, and then glue the whole mess together with an enzyme so it looks like a real lamb chop or squid patty.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this next caller.

**Caller:** I just started listening about 30 or 40 minutes ago, and you were talking about these sources being inorganic. So would organic whole wheat pasta or organic meats have less phosphate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. It's a matter of whether they have added it to one product and not to the other. But the way the animal is fed depends more on whether it has a lot of grass versus grains. The grains can be organic, but they're still very high in phosphate. So the animal will be slightly poisoned by eating them.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So grass-fed meat and milk will have a lower phosphate level than grain-fed. But because grains are very high in phosphate, whole wheat pasta would be higher in phosphate than white pasta.

**Andrew Murray:** I think there might have been some confusion between the inorganic phosphate that occurs in food and the naturally occurring phosphates.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In physiology, when you say that the organic phosphate is a protein with a phosphorus group on it or the ATP molecule, when that releases the phosphate, you call it inorganic just because it's not attached to another molecule. But we're constantly making our own inorganic phosphate molecules.

## Vitamin K, Baking Soda, and Arterial Health

**Andrew Murray:** I know you've mentioned the misnomer that increased calcium will cause calcification, where it's actually the opposite. It's possible to reverse arterial calcification?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Japanese have done studies using vitamin K—very high doses of it—to effectively rebuild osteoporotic bones while taking calcium out of arteries in animal studies. Vitamin K works on cellular energy and specifically on the handling of carbon dioxide, which lets the proteins handle calcium.

Things that increase your carbon dioxide work right along with vitamin K in helping to keep the calcium and phosphate in your bones rather than in your arteries. Even baking soda helps to build strong bones. It acts the same as vitamin K or niacinamide: helping the kidneys to excrete phosphate that you don't need, helping to deposit calcium and phosphate in the bones while taking it out of arteries.

**Andrew Murray:** You've also mentioned the link between parathyroid hormone and calcium.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who have good thyroid function and get enough calcium in their diet have a pretty low parathyroid hormone activity—towards the low end of the normal range. At the middle of the so-called normal range, people tend to suffer inflammatory diseases, muscle pains, and bone loss. The higher the parathyroid is, the more of these degenerative inflammatory diseases you have. The first way to suppress that excess parathyroid is by eating enough calcium, but also vitamin D.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if somebody doesn't get enough calcium or vitamin D, they will be eating their bones.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an experiment with animals 35 years ago, they put one group on a starchy diet and the other group with only sugar as the carbohydrate, both with a vitamin D deficiency. The ones on the starchy diet had very weak, atrophied bones. But the sugar diet built strong bones despite the deficiency in vitamin D. Sugar was lowering phosphate, and apparently, that accounted for the sugar making up for a vitamin D deficiency.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think any of this can be an energy-driven process from the sugar being used directly as fuel for cellular respiration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. As they saw in William Brown's study, the high sugar diet with calcium increased his production of carbon dioxide. When he started the experiment, his metabolic rate was 10 or 12% below normal. When he got on that diet, it came up almost to normal.

**Andrew Murray:** That would be measured by his basal body temperature.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Also monitoring carbon dioxide on blood tests. And the phosphate in the blood—there are some comprehensive metabolic panels that include phosphate. The range is like 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL. You were suggesting that it's better if it's between 2 and 3.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** William Brown's was 4 when he started and came down to 2.7 or 3.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in the wintertime, do you suggest that people eat more sugars because of the decreasing daylight hours and decreased vitamin D exposure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it helps to activate the thyroid, too. Your liver needs sugar to convert thyroxine into the active T3 hormone. I think people tend to crave sweets more in the winter, which is an adaptive instinct.

## Caller: Low Thyroid and Body Temperature

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this next caller.

**Caller:** I have low thyroid function and I have a low body temperature, like down in 97. I'm curious if you have any suggestions for that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes just a deficiency of protein can create a low thyroid state. But usually, polyunsaturated fats, too much of the cabbage family vegetables, and too many beans and grains—all these have some anti-thyroid agents. Changing your diet away from those towards the fruit, milk, and cheese categories helps. The saturated fats don't have these toxic anti-thyroid effects. So butter and coconut oil can actually help to increase your metabolic rate and thyroid while reducing inflammation.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't it only one teaspoon of these polyunsaturated fats a day that starts suppressing the immune system and the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They've looked at various animal studies to see where the influence of polyunsaturated fats in increasing cancer mortality starts, and it's with 4 grams a day for the average human body weight.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which is one teaspoon.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the saturated fat foods like milk, coconut oil, cheese, and butter have about 2% unsaturated fats. So even when you're avoiding the cooking oils and mayonnaise, you're still getting two or three grams a day of PUFA unavoidably.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So polyunsaturated fats include fish oil, hemp seed oil, flaxseed oil, canola, sunflower, soy, corn oil, and cottonseed.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this next caller.

**Caller:** You said something about vitamin K and also baking soda working similarly for hardening of the arteries. Do you suggest taking that, and how much would you take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin K, you can get a high potency formula of a mixture of K1 and K2. With that, I think from 1 to 10 milligrams per day is in the safe range as well as probably being therapeutic for the arteries.

**Caller:** Where would you get vitamin K? And if you can't get it, can you use baking soda instead?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Liver and kale are the famously rich sources. I take liver once or twice a month at least. But I've known people who regularly take one or two teaspoons of baking soda with meals or after meals. They notice that it increases their endurance and energy.

**Caller:** Interesting. I use it myself for heartburn. It works incredibly well instantaneously.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They've tested it on athletes. As much as a tablespoon at the start of a race can really improve their endurance and performance. I think usually the amount you take for stomach acidity is a good amount.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Vitamin K, you can buy that online. A brand that's pretty pure is Thorne Research Vitamin K liquid; one drop is 1 milligram. So we're talking about one to ten drops.

## Vitamin D, Klotho, and Winter Diet

**Andrew Murray:** Let's quickly go back to vitamin D. We've talked about vitamin D in relation to calcification and how it can correct calcium deposition.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things currently being studied is the so-called activated vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is the kind that you make when you're deficient in calcium or vitamin D. It seems to have bad effects. The anti-aging protein *Klotho* suppresses the formation of that activated stuff. So taking vitamin D and calcium has a similar effect as that anti-aging protein *Klotho*.

**Andrew Murray:** *Klotho* has only been discovered since 1998. It's a beta-glucuronidase, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. No one really understands how it works yet. They just know some of the side effects. They're doing experiments with mice; increasing the production of it makes them live extra long, like 30% longer. But you can do some of the same things with fructose, niacinamide, baking soda, and so on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Let's talk about some good food sources of niacinamide.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Liver, milk, cheese, eggs, tortillas.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, coffee. Dark roast coffee is a very good source. Also magnesium, which works against phosphate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How many milligrams of niacinamide is in a cup of coffee?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I figured that with dark roast coffee, I could get close to 40 milligrams a day just from drinking several cups.

## Coffee, Niacin, and Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We've got about six minutes left. From the perspective of phosphate to calcium intake, people should take note that they need adequate calcium if they're going to consume foods high in phosphate like beans, nuts, and meats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Whenever you eat high phosphate foods like meat or nuts, if you have some sugar along with it—fructose in the intestine increases the resistance of the intestine to taking up phosphate. So it's like a phosphate blocker in the intestine while a phosphate loss promoter in the kidneys.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Good sugar sources are fresh ripe juicy fruit, honey, and sugar. Milk has a good sugar, lactose.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's sort of equivalent to protecting against the high iron content of meat by having some coffee at the same meal. But if you put sugar in the coffee, then you're protecting against the phosphate too.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And protecting your adrenal glands from lowered blood sugar.

**Andrew Murray:** I love it. All of those things that they would have told you are bad for you are actually the things that are good for you. Saturated fats, animal fats, calcium, milk, cheese.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I think our ancestors had it figured out thousands of years ago. We can't reinvent the wheel with all of our modern-day processed foods.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** If you go to www.raypeat.com, you'll find a link to the articles. There are probably about 50 or 60 articles, all fully referenced, around the subjects of aging, phosphate, and the anti-aging effects of hormones like thyroid and progesterone. He's a research endocrinologist, so he knows what he's talking about. Our phone number is 1-888-WBM-HERB. We can be reached anytime after the show, Monday through Friday.
