## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who have never listened to the shows, we are licensed medical herbalists. We trained and graduated in England with a master's degree in herbal medicine, and we run a clinic in Garberville, California, where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

This month's subject is thinking outside the box, specifically regarding novel approaches to cancer treatment. We are looking at a viewpoint other than the deterministic view of killing cancer cells. Cancer has traditionally been viewed as something to destroy, and to this end, the mainstream treatment is either cytotoxic cell-killing drugs, which poison the body, or directed radiation. These are "cidal"—they kill cells directly, often with associated collateral damage and inflammation.

However, novel approaches are making themselves known. Nobel Prize winner James Watson recently made observations regarding cancer treatment, and a very "outside the box" theory has emerged. Dr. Raymond Peat joins us to share his viewpoint.

Most people are under the mistaken belief that antioxidants are always good for you and the more, the better. But this is not always true; sometimes these very antioxidants can fuel cancer metabolism. Dr. Peat will outline the physiology and chemistry of the redox system—the reduction-oxidation processes necessary for regular cell functioning. Once we elucidate the redox activity within the body, we can better understand these novel approaches.

Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us again.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** To give people who haven't listened before an understanding, could you introduce your professional and academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1968, I decided to go to graduate school for a PhD and graduated in 1972, specializing in reproductive aging and oxidative changes. It was the oxidative metabolism that I saw changing with aging, which went against the grain. Already at that time, I saw an increase of *reductive* activity with aging.

For example, you can put a dye in young tissue and old tissue. Reductive enzymes, fueled by the energy-producing system and the internal antioxidant system, will reduce the dye. The older tissue reduced the dye much more energetically, looking like it was "more alive." You can test the vitality of any tissue by the intensity of staining of this tetrazolium chemical. I found that an overdose of estrogen, a deficiency of vitamin E, or any serious injury such as X-rays, will increase the ability of the tissue to stain this dye.

So, aging and these various injuries all increased the reductive activity of the tissue, which involves what are called the antioxidative enzyme defense systems. That got me interested in the fact that cancer is very rich in antioxidative defenses. At that time, people were trying to identify specific chemicals cancers used to defend themselves against oxidative poisons like chemotherapy. But over the last 40 years, it has developed that it isn't just a simple chemical they produce defensively; the very basic life processes are shifted in that direction.

## The Extracellular Matrix and Cell Environment

**Andrew Murray:** There is a novel way of looking at cells based on new findings in the extracellular matrix—the fluidity within which cells are mobile. It was previously posited that once a cell differentiated, its fate was sealed. But new studies find a "quantum state" where things are fluid; cells communicate in two directions. What implications does the extracellular matrix have for cancer treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The rigid doctrine of the organism that governs current cancer therapy was imposed on a more basic biological view starting around 1830 with Johannes Peter Müller, who described tumors as a problem of organization, not of defective cells. That approach continued through embryology in the 1930s and 40s, where people showed that dissociated cells could reconstruct the organism.

The environment the cells live in is constantly being constructed to meet their needs. If a cell or organ becomes isolated, it loses its sense of direction. If there is no stimulation and no energy flowing through the system, the cell doesn't know what it should be doing. But ordinary cells, if they see a defect in their environment, will reach out and correct it.

The extracellular matrix consists of collagen for stiffness—rigid linear molecules—and carbohydrate chains (polysaccharides) in between that retain water and create an elastic environment. Cells prefer a certain rigidity. When you take an isolated cell and put it on a surface that varies in stiffness, the cells will creep towards the firmer footing. If you inject broken-down collagen fibers into an organism, the cells will rearrange that disorganized collagen, aligning it like bricklayers.

**Andrew Murray:** Because they have an inherent knowledge of the structure they should be in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and they like it fairly solid. However, they can create more polysaccharides to hold more water, opening the structure to diffuse nutrients. It has to be just right. There are proteins at the surface chemically connected to the structure of the cell all the way through. The sulfur and sulfhydryl system of the cell gives it much of its toughness, and it has to be constantly broken down and reformed because the cell inside is constantly in motion.

**Andrew Murray:** So there is a constant connection of sulfhydryl from the outside to the center of the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. About 40 years ago, experimenters found that if they blocked those surface sulfur groups, the cell couldn't stick to its environment. The degree of reduction and oxidation of the surface sulfur groups is a big part of how it sticks to its environment, moves, and shapes its environment. That degree of oxidation is governed by what has been called the antioxidant defense system.

## Redox Potential: Oxidants vs. Antioxidants

**Andrew Murray:** Can you describe how this reduction and oxidation (redox) potential works in the matrix and how this determines disease versus health? Specifically regarding the consumption of antioxidants, which might be a bad choice for cancer strategy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many people think of the cell as a reducing or antioxidative environment. But if you look at specific components, such as the molecule that transfers electrons from glucose to the mitochondrion to be oxidized—NAD is the coenzyme, and it becomes reduced to NADH.

In a healthy cell, the ratio of the oxidized form (NAD) is hundreds of times greater than the reduced form (NADH)—about 500 times greater. That governing antioxidant is actually in a highly oxidized state. This is in balance with ascorbic acid, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, and the glutathione system. These are all energized by the electron from NADH, which comes from glucose.

So, the normal cell is in a highly oxidized state. If the cell is sick—for example, a cancer cell—the ratio approaches one-to-one. It is almost 50% in the reduced, antioxidant state. If you injure a cell, you turn on this signaling system. Anything that irritates the cell is likely to turn on more of the reducing system, pushing it in the direction of stress or cancer with a high ratio of NADH to NAD.

**Andrew Murray:** So you want the cell in an oxidized form? You don't want it to have excess antioxidant activity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct. The healthy, active cell has 500 times more of the oxidized NAD. When people sell powerful antioxidants, they often test them in a test tube where they destroy oxidizing fragments. But inside the cell, things like ascorbic acid and vitamin E become oxidized. Dehydroascorbic acid is an oxidant, and it is eight times more concentrated in the cell than outside.

When you irritate the cell, you turn on the defensive antioxidant reductive systems. The system which normally should be oxidized all the way through gets stuck in an over-reduced, over-electrified form. Since the 1930s, people have seen that any cell which is dividing goes into this highly reduced state where everything shifts to the sulfhydryl form rather than the disulfide form.

**Andrew Murray:** And this includes cancer cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Normal cells go into this phase, quickly divide, and then return to their oxidized state. The vitamin E and vitamin C go back to becoming oxidants, keeping the system tightened up and helping to squeeze water out.

The membrane potential of a cell is normally around 100 millivolts. The redox difference is in a range of about 15 millivolts—a very small fraction of the energy available. This 15-millivolt difference governs practically all reactions in the cell: energy production, protein synthesis, and the economy of the cell.

**Andrew Murray:** It sounds like a tight range within which normality exists.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. When you measure products like pyruvic acid versus lactic acid, these are an index of the oxidative or reductive state. When the cell is in trouble, it turns pyruvic acid into lactic acid by reducing it. That reflects the highly reduced antioxidant state. When oxygen is working properly, the cell consumes pyruvic acid and turns it into carbon dioxide.

Carbon dioxide is an acid and, in a sense, an oxidant. It causes the retraction of electrons.

**Andrew Murray:** So the fundamental here is mopping up electrons?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Free Radicals and Supplements

**Andrew Murray:** I’ve understood free radical damage to be a result of free radical liberation that isn't mopped up by antioxidants. Are free radicals almost more beneficial than the antioxidants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is James Watson's interpretation, but I think that is not correct. The antioxidant system does good things defending against toxic free radicals. However, the normal oxidative functions involving ascorbic acid, vitamin E, and the sulfhydryl balancing system are able to control the system without resorting to the toxic chemicals Watson is suggesting.

**Andrew Murray:** You advocate for fruit consumption, vitamin C, and vitamin E as safe, gentle antioxidants compared to the "super antioxidants" on the supplement market.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's because they are electrically tuned to a specific role in the cell. If you put in dynamite instead of alcohol, you can have the same overall energy expense, but it isn't under control. Some of the antioxidants they are selling are more like dynamite.

When the good antioxidants are working properly, the system can run as fast as it wants, oxidizing at full speed. As you rev up the oxidizing process—using thyroid hormone, for example—you actually get *fewer* free radical productions. The good antioxidants work with the mitochondria; the faster that system runs, the fewer electrons get away to cause dangerous free radicals.

**Andrew Murray:** This is like aerobic versus anaerobic glycolysis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the cell gets out of control, oxygen is no longer able to suck up the electrons, so the cell expels them as lactic acid. This is a survival mechanism. However, the desperate production of lactic acid raises the pH inside the cell and lowers the pH outside the cell.

The embryologist Holtfreter demonstrated that if you put an embryo in a slightly acidified solution, the cells simply leave the embryo and float off. So, the cancer or stress metabolism acidifying the outside of the cell tends to destroy the cell's connection to its environment. At the same time, raising the pH inside the cell makes it swell up, take up water, shift the sulfhydryl balance into the reduced state, and turn on constant cell division.

## Exercise and Breast Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** Exercise generates biological oxidants which could be a valid approach to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exercise will cause cells to take up glucose in the absence of insulin and make them operate effectively. Uncoupling proteins or increased thyroid are the cell's equivalent of exercise. Exercise should keep everything active, but when it doesn't, the organism can defend itself by running things at a higher speed.

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding breast cancer, Mina Bissell presented work showing that the context and architecture of the cell govern whether cancers are present. She showed a cancerous duct cell could be turned back to normal not by poisoning it, but by normalizing the extracellular matrix.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The exercise idea is relevant to breast cancer. Women who are constantly having babies and nursing through their fertile years have a very low risk of breast cancer. What is working keeps working; the cells have a load and a job to do, so they keep their extracellular matrix organized to support what they are doing.

**Andrew Murray:** How much credence do you give to the high exposure to progesterone during pregnancy regarding that low incidence of breast cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is the main thing. If you expose a rabbit to estrogen, connective tissue like tendons becomes stiff and hardened. Every time it becomes pregnant and estrogen goes up, you see a momentary shift toward hardening, but after each pregnancy, it is *less* hardened than before. It is the progesterone which reverses those changes in the extracellular matrix. It also erases intracellular estrogen functions.

## Caller Questions: Genetics and Diet

**Caller (David):** I was born with some interesting genetics—I was born from two eggs, a chimera. I have both genders because of that. How does that happen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Embryologists have made chimeras. That was one of the early demonstrations that mutations aren't the cause of cancer. The somatic mutation theory was debunked 40 years ago when someone took a cell from a tumor (from a black hamster) and put it in the embryo of a white hamster. The developing organism had four parents and was a mixture of white and black inheritance, showing that what had been a cancer cell developed into an ordinary part of the organism.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you have anything to say about chimeras in the human population?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they are probably not as extremely rare as one would suppose because early embryos, if they get too close, can easily mix and form one organism.

**Andrew Murray:** We had another caller ask about low carb diets—the fat-burning ketone diet. He said it helped him, but wanted your thoughts.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You don't produce ketones unless you are raising your cortisol enough to activate the conversion of protein into glucose. At the same time, you turn some fat into ketones.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's a stressful state?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The problem occurs over a few years of exposure to that increased breakdown of protein; the cortisol affects your connective tissues. The Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who advocated a meat diet, noticed that the Eskimos were prematurely aged in appearance. Their skin became very wrinkled. I think that is what you would expect from being exposed to very high cortisol constantly.

**Andrew Murray:** I recently saw a *New Scientist* cover with a piece of bacon spelling "FACT," asking if we got 40 years of dietary advice wrong. It’s good to see them admitting that saturated fat is good and polyunsaturates and fish oils are being questioned.

## Urea Therapy for Cancer

**Andrew Murray:** I want to bring up Dr. Danopoulos's work with urea therapy from the 1980s regarding liver cancer. How familiar are you with urea as a compound for the treatment of carcinomas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the First World War, it was used as an emergency treatment to stimulate healing in wounds and hold down infections. In the 1920s, it was often used for inoperable cancer.

The effect of forming lactic acid causes the pH of the cell to become more alkaline inside, which causes swelling. Swelling promotes replication and proliferation. Urea happens to be a very innocuous substance that acts somewhat like an osmotic dehydrator. It helps to prevent excess swelling and water retention.

**Andrew Murray:** You think that is one of its main effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The dehydrated cell becomes more oxidatively active and catabolic, burning fuel faster, whereas the swollen cell is anabolic and simply growing. Urea would work well with a good thyroid program, which helps you retain the normal amount of sodium chloride. Hypothyroid people produce a matrix that is over-hydrated. Low thyroid function lets your kidneys lose sodium while retaining water. So, osmotic therapies like urea would work nicely with supplementing thyroid to normalize sodium retention.

## Visualization and Models

**Caller (David):** When you describe these processes, you do it so beautifully. Are you actually seeing images? Do you have visual models of how this works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see little models. Not that I've seen anything exactly like it, but I have mental models. For example, regarding the extension of the sulfhydryl groups onto the surface of a cell, I have very concrete pictures of how that works. It helps me when I'm looking for information to check against published research facts.

**Caller (David):** Since you're a painter, I thought that must be an important part of your process.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. I've always been aware of having a map of where I'm going.

**Caller (David):** If you are seeing it like that, you could be part of the healing process by seeing what is wrong and what needs to be fixed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We were talking about the different theories of what a cancer is. The new theory is called TOFT—Tissue Organization Field Theory. I think that needs another adjective: *organismic*. It isn't just the local tissue organization, but how that tissue fits into the whole organism and how the activity of the organism keeps everything working.

**Andrew Murray:** It is very much a holistic way of looking at it. Nothing is fixed; everything is fluid and dynamic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Individual cells, like pigment cells, can sometimes be seen migrating through tissue. They move at the same rate cells crawl on a glass slide—something like a centimeter and a half per day. A very tiny cell really zips along through the solid tissue.

**Andrew Murray:** We are out of time. Dr. Ray Peat is a wealth of experience. His website is [www.raypeat.com](http://www.raypeat.com). His articles are fully referenced and cover topics from diabetes to saturated fats, cancer, dementia, and hormones. Thanks for joining us.
