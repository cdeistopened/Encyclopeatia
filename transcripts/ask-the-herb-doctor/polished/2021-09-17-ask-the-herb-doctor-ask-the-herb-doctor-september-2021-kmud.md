## Introduction

**Michael McCaskill:** The regular hosts, Andrew and Sarah, aren't here yet. I have Dr. Peat online. We thought we were just going to do a random show, but we will open the lines. Dr. Peat, why don't you give a little bit of background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been doing nutrition consulting largely for the last 40 or 50 years, but I'm recently getting more interested in immunology. It's been 40 years since I taught a course in immunology, but because of the pandemic, I started reading more about it. I have been looking at the history and development of corporate and government science, and the way those influences have distorted the understanding of immunology, even in these 40 years since I was studying and teaching it.

## Vitamin D and Immunity

**Michael McCaskill:** There has been a lot of conflict around COVID-19 and vaccination. Could you give some herbological or dietary recommendations beneficial for everybody, regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not, to make sure their immune system works its best?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin D is probably the single most important thing for Americans. Considering the average American diet, the majority of people are far below the optimal level of vitamin D. Even though the establishment still believes that the lower end of the normal range is adequate, when you look at degenerative diseases—heart disease and even fairly rare things like scleroderma—the whole range of degenerative system failure is associated with a fairly low vitamin D level.

Something that has kept more doctors from prescribing vitamin D is that there have periodically been scares about the dangers of taking too much. It's true that if you take a million units or so, after a while you'll start getting hypercalcemia—calcification of soft tissues. But the most common cause of calcification of the soft tissues is actually from a *deficiency* of vitamin D.

With aging and kidney failure, calcification of the kidney tissue and blood vessels becomes the lethal problem. The mechanism for why kidney failure is associated with calcification is that it is also associated with extreme vitamin D deficiency and an excess of parathyroid hormone. They've seen that removing the parathyroid glands can alleviate some of the symptoms of calcification from kidney failure. Just supplementing a moderate amount of vitamin D, like 5,000 units a day for an adult, can be enough. If you have calcium in your diet, it can be enough to lower the parathyroid hormone. Lowering the parathyroid hormone makes you put your calcium into the bones where it should go, keeping it out of the soft tissues.

## Sunlight vs. Supplements

**Michael McCaskill:** People can get vitamin D from sunlight, though it depends on skin tone and time spent outside. Are there other things you get from sunlight that might make it a better source than just taking a pill?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because the light that penetrates the ultraviolet spectrum is very superficial; it acts on the skin cells themselves. But the visible light, especially the orange and red light, penetrates very deeply. If you hold your hand up and look at the sunlight shining through it, it's very red on the shaded side, showing that the red light easily penetrates the thickness of your skin.

The red light acts as anti-free radical protection. It effectively quenches excited electrons and reverses the effect of the free radical damage done by ultraviolet light. A tanning bed, which is only UV and some visible light, will produce more aging effects than sunlight of the same tanning effect. The UV by itself causes free radical damage and aging of the skin. But with sunlight, the quenching effect of the red and orange light detoxifies much of the free radical damage done by the ultraviolet.

## Cellular Excitation and Infection Susceptibility

**Caller (James from Arizona):** I've subscribed to your newsletter for years. In one of the first newsletters about this coronavirus, you said cellular excitation is required for a coronavirus infection. If a person is not "cellularly excited," would they just not be exposed or develop antibodies because they don't need to?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If your cells are already in a weakened, excitable state, they are the most susceptible to viral infection. If the cell is stable, even if it's infected by a virus, it will turn off the process rather than letting the virus propagate.

The things that are known to be protective against the infection, or alleviate its worst symptoms, include almost all of the known safe anti-inflammatory substances. Aspirin, naproxen, progesterone, and vitamin D have that calming, quieting effect on cells. The antihistamines, anti-serotonin drugs, and anti-angiotensin blood pressure treatments—such as Losartan and Candesartan—are also protective.

**Caller:** You’ve talked about how some proteins are acidifying; for example, phosphorus gets metabolized into phosphoric acid. You discussed the importance of having adequate alkaline minerals in your cells so the body wouldn't have to sacrifice protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens in the kidneys; the kidneys will break down protein to balance the pH. But the phosphate itself has an excitatory action. When ATP is breaking down to do cell work, it liberates inorganic phosphate. Inorganic phosphate has an excitatory effect. When it can get attached back to form ATP again, the cell relaxes. So ATP's effect is relaxing, making the cell stable against infection. An excess of free phosphate antagonizes the stabilizing effect of vitamin D and calcium, putting cells into the excited state susceptible to infections.

**Caller:** How do sulfur and sulfuric acid play into that balance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are pretty safe. If you add too much sulfur to your diet, you'll disturb the absorption of minerals. For example, you can block the formation of pigment by cutting down your assimilation of copper if you have too much sulfur. But otherwise, sulfur-rich foods are reasonably safe; you can dispose of it as the acid.

## Long COVID, Kidneys, and Carbon Dioxide

**Caller:** My friend's husband, who is in his 70s, had the virus. He survived but has gone back to the hospital recently with kidney issues, and they have him on diuretics. What is good for a "long COVID" autoimmune condition hitting the kidneys?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mentioning the diuretics brings up a perspective on what's actually happening in the infection. In the first weeks of the pandemic, two doctors in New York realized that the symptoms of COVID were essentially the same as the symptoms of high-altitude sickness. People who don't adapt to very high altitudes develop edema of the lungs and general inflammatory systems—a failure of the tissues to use oxygen properly.

One of the established treatments for mountain sickness is a diuretic called acetazolamide. It restores the level of carbon dioxide in your body and the acidity. That acidity has a quieting, sedating effect that also causes the tissue cells to give up excess water. Carbon dioxide itself has many calming, sedative effects. Calcium channel blockers were their other suggestion for both mountain sickness and the COVID infection.

One of these doctors, Cameron Kyle-Sidell, observed that the inflamed lung creates a thickness between the capillary and the air chamber. This is increased by inflammation and by a deficiency of carbon dioxide. It makes it harder for gases to diffuse through this thickened pathway. It happens that carbon dioxide diffuses much faster through liquid than oxygen does. Kyle-Sidell observed the breathing problem is because you are losing carbon dioxide very fast. When your carbon dioxide level goes down, oxygen sticks too firmly to the hemoglobin. It increases the blood's affinity for oxygen to the point that your tissue cells are starving for oxygen despite some oxygen being there. It helps to some extent to get more oxygen in, but it's really the deficiency of carbon dioxide in the blood that keeps the oxygen from being delivered as needed.

**Michael McCaskill:** I've heard complaints about masks increasing the carbon dioxide level people are breathing in. Might that actually be a bonus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, that's what the acetazolamide and calcium channel blockers are doing. It's making you retain the carbon dioxide more efficiently.

**Michael McCaskill:** Would drinking carbonated drinks or baking soda help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Marathon runners and cyclists have found that if they put a tablespoon of baking soda in a glass of water, their endurance is greatly increased, apparently by the provision of that bonus of carbon dioxide.

Regarding the hospitals that used forced ventilating machines—putting a tube into the throat and pumping oxygen—they were having terribly high mortality. Some approaching 100% of the intubated people died. Adjoining hospitals simply passively giving them a little extra oxygen had close to zero mortality. The excess of pumped-in oxygen was entering the lungs and driving out too much carbon dioxide, making the problem worse.

This brings up the subject of Carbogen. I haven't heard of any hospital consistently using that as treatment, but it was a treatment from the 1930s up until the mid-1950s. Hospitals recognized that using a mixture of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% oxygen, rather than pure oxygen, prevented the damage to the lungs. Its use dropped off around 1955 because a government medical committee in England declared that asphyxia is synonymous with having too much carbon dioxide. They had no evidence to support it, but since that official statement, its use dropped off. Studies show that it does prevent ventilator lung damage and has an anti-inflammatory effect.

**Caller:** I found a translation of a German paper from 1904 that said sometimes a person doesn't need oxygen, just a little whiff of carbon dioxide, and it improves their oxygen uptake.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is the mechanism. It is recognized that hemoglobin is acidified by the binding of oxygen, but the more acidic carbon dioxide molecule shifts the pH and oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin. It out-competes the oxygen for combining with the hemoglobin.

The mechanism by which carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin forms a chemical bond called the carbamino group. The textbooks mention that the amino group of certain amino acids chemically combines with carbon dioxide, forming a modified protein. All of our body proteins display some of these same amino groups. Carbon dioxide is going to similarly bind every place in the body where there is protein. So, the toxicity of losing your proper level of carbon dioxide—by going to high altitude, hyperventilating, or being ventilated with pure oxygen—is not only inflaming your lungs but, in effect, inflaming every protein in your body.

## Carnitine and Metabolism

**Caller (Ross from Whitethorn):** What do you think of L-Carnitine? I read about it in a book by Dr. Nick Lane.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is active in helping you oxidize fats, so in ordinary metabolism, it is essential. However, when you're under stress, the products of oxidizing pure fat will produce less carbon dioxide in proportion to the oxygen used. In stressful situations, such as a failing heart, carnitine—by increasing your ability to oxidize fats—can actually increase the problem of oxygen availability.

In the 1990s, researchers found that if you could keep the cells oxidizing glucose, they produce more carbon dioxide per oxygen consumed. The effect is to make metabolism more efficient, reduce inflammation via increased carbon dioxide, and leave more oxygen available by changing the affinity of hemoglobin. The chemical that increased the ability to use glucose rather than fat was called Mildronate (or Meldonium). Athletes are using it, and it has disqualified some famous athletes because it improves endurance noticeably. It works by bypassing carnitine. Even though carnitine is normal and essential, under stress, Mildronate can bypass it and get glucose to the cells.

## Dairy, Whey, and Iron

**Caller:** I seem to crave cottage cheese, and I think it might be the whey that I crave. Could you discuss whey?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The physiology of consuming any milk products—both the whey and the casein fractions—has multiple beneficial effects that are approaching hormonal and immune-promoting. One of their virtues is that they are deficient in iron but have almost all other nutrients. Iron happens to be one of the main risks of any stress; stress tends to make iron toxic and increase susceptibility to infections. Milk provides helpful nutrients but is very deficient in iron.

Additionally, the high calcium content of milk products works along with vitamin D to suppress parathyroid hormone. These peptides and proteins of milk, casein, and whey contain anti-inflammatory substances intrinsically, but they also lower parathyroid hormone simply because of the calcium. Parathyroid hormone is one of our basic pro-inflammatory problems; it lowers cellular energy production and increases cytokines.

## Arrhythmia and Histamine

**Caller:** Do you have nutritional advice for arrhythmia, specifically PVCs (premature ventricular contractions)? I have thousands every day with no other symptoms.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the basic medical recommendations is to avoid hyperthyroidism. You can provoke an arrhythmia with a sudden dose of thyroid. However, a *chronic lack* of thyroid hormone can create preconditions for having arrhythmia, including nutritional imbalances and increases in stress hormones. It involves an imbalance between the stress steroids (including cortisol and estrogen) and the anti-stress, quieting steroids (pregnenolone, progesterone, and to some extent, the androgens).

**Caller:** Is there an association with histamine? I also have very itchy skin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, serotonin and histamine are closely connected with changing the heart rhythm.

**Michael McCaskill:** Is there a dietary recommendation to help be anti-histamine while supporting the heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Milk products have an antihistamine and anti-inflammatory effect. You also need a good balance of all the essential nutrients needed for thyroid function. Seafood at least once a week is helpful for the trace minerals.

## Cravings and Nutritional Wisdom

**Michael McCaskill:** Regarding the caller's comment about craving shellfish—how do cravings work? Does the body know what is good for it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies, mostly in animals, but some people have tested it on their kids. They noticed kids will sometimes seem to have a deranged appetite, wanting only one food for several meals. But when they looked at the food choices over a week or two, it turned out their choices ended up providing a proper balance of nutrients.

They've tested this on animals by creating a deficiency in a particular vitamin or amino acid. They find that the animal knows how to ignore a food that might seem generally good but is deficient in what they need, and instead concentrate on the food richest in what they need. It turns out there are only two or three essential amino acids that act as signals. If they make a food deficient in one of the amino acids that *doesn't* act as a guide, the animal no longer makes the right choice. But in nature, those rare patterns of deficiency don't occur. So, animals given a choice of natural foods will invariably pick out the ones that are nutritionally balanced.

## Lung Irritation and Fungus

**Caller:** I had a pile of wood chips delivered that turned out to be full of Aspergillus fungus. I inhaled the spores and was wheezing. What kind of antifungal or advice do you have for getting fungus out of my lungs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably your lungs are going to take care of it, but it never hurts to make sure your vitamin D is adequate. Vitamin D is the most important immune-supporting nutrient for Americans. In the world in general, vitamin A and zinc are rivals for protection of the membranes and direct immunity to germs, mechanical, or chemical irritants. A good diet with anti-inflammatory foods helps. Besides milk products, citrus fruits are very rich in flavonoids which are anti-inflammatory and pro-immunity. Coffee is another good source of anti-inflammatory substances such as quercetin.

## Vitamin D vs. D3

**Caller:** What is the difference between vitamin D and D3? Which one should we take?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** D3 is the normal one that we make when we are in the sunlight. It works the same chemically as the one we make. Some products on the market are vitamin D2; that is metabolized slightly differently and doesn't have all the good protective effects of vitamin D3.

In a medical context, you might hear people talk about calcitriol. You don't want the triol—some people confuse that with vitamin D3. You want cholecalciferol (D3).

## Brain Fog and Long COVID

**Caller:** I have a brain fog issue. I had COVID about a year ago. Do you have recommendations for mental acuity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Brain fog goes with low energy production and low carbon dioxide. Vitamin B1 is a natural equivalent to acetazolamide and the calcium channel blockers in being an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, helping to raise your carbon dioxide. It is often the quickest way to clear up brain fog and get your mental energy back. But all of the anti-inflammatory things help: thyroid hormone, vitamin D, calcium, progesterone, and fruit juice.

## Diabetes and Fasting

**Caller:** I've had diabetes for many years. I have investigated intermittent fasting. So far it seems to be bringing my blood sugar down. What are your thoughts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It will make your blood sugar go down, but anything that you can call fasting is going to be putting you under stress. The long-range thing that corrects chronic diabetes is to get your polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) lower—to completely eliminate them from your diet as far as possible. Use butter for cooking rather than any liquid vegetable oils.

The polyunsaturated fats are specifically toxic to your insulin-producing tissues, create resistance in your tissues, and damage the ability to oxidize sugar. They have no essential need; there is no benefit lost by eating a completely saturated fat component. Regarding carbohydrates, if they are taken in a consistent way, it happens that glucose is constantly activating stem cells in your pancreas to restore the ability to produce insulin. It is the polyunsaturated fats stored in your tissues or coming directly from your food that will keep destroying or damaging your insulin-producing cells.
