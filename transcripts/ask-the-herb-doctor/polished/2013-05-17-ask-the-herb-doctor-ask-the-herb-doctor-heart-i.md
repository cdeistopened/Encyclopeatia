# Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Hi and welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. This month is a slightly different format. My wife, who normally joins us on the show, is not with me as we had a beautiful baby girl last month. So, we're going to run the show tonight with Dr. Raymond Peat. He is going to share his wisdom on the subject of heart failure and hormones.

As usual, people are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's show. There is an ever-growing Ray Peat Facebook fan page, and we get emails from all over the states from people following him. It is always very good to hear anecdotal evidence of people improving fairly drastically by making the changes that he's been advocating for the last 20-plus years.

The thrust of the show is heart failure, although there is hopefully some time to look at new research surrounding the understanding of cancer and metastases in relation to solid tumors and the way the body recruits collagen.

Welcome, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**Andrew Murray:** For the benefit of people who have never heard of you, could you give us an outline of your academic and professional career?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From 1968 to 1972, I was in graduate school at the University of Oregon. I did my dissertation on reproductive aging and how oxidative metabolism changes with age. I found that the changes causing the menopause equivalent in animals happen in every tissue in the body. It just happens that the uterus is where I did my dissertation work, but I was interested in aging changes in the brain and bones as well. It turns out that the same chemical and biological processes change through time in all of these tissues.

In my dissertation, one of the aging theories that I talked about was the collagen theory of aging: that estrogen excess causes wastage of oxygen, basically suffocating tissues the way radiation would, and destroying the ability to use oxygen. As a result of that, excess collagen is produced by the collagen-producing cells (fibroblasts) in the connective tissue. With aging, the collagen becomes progressively denser and more cross-linked, creating an oxygen-deprived environment. My emphasis at that time was on how estrogen, produced by irritation or aging, causes more collagen to be produced and to become more dense, creating further interference with oxygen consumption.

## Pathophysiology of Congestive Heart Failure

**Andrew Murray:** Roughly 5.7 million people in the US are suffering from congestive heart failure. Would you explain the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure so listeners can understand what the disease entails?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In congestive heart failure, the heart muscle simply gets weaker and less able to pump a full volume of blood with each stroke. The diastolic phase, which should be a relaxation phase, is inadequate. The heart stays partly contracted, so it has a short stroke. To make up for the shortness of the stroke, it tends to pump faster.

Ordinarily, when a healthy heart muscle pumps faster, it has a bigger stroke so that it doesn't have to simply increase the speed; it can increase the volume with each stroke. But with heart failure, that's impossible. So it tends to lead to a fast but weak heartbeat.

**Andrew Murray:** And the actual muscle of the heart itself becomes more flabby and weak?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It becomes waterlogged—a higher concentration of water in the tissue. That's because it isn't relaxing fully. When you work a muscle tremendously, you can actually make a muscle swell up. In just 15 or 20 minutes of very intense contraction, your muscle will gain weight because it doesn't relax fully and retains calcium and excess water. A very fatigued biceps muscle, for example, is temporarily equivalent to what's happening in the failing heart.

If that condition of retaining water and calcium persists for a long time—because the heart isn't getting enough sugar or oxygen to relax, or if it's being stimulated by estrogen—that prevents full relaxation. Chronically, it tends to produce more collagen, and that collagen tends to become hardened. So at first, it's just a swollen condition. Then it gradually becomes a fibrotic condition, and that can actually lead to the development of a bone in the heart—calcification that actually contains crystalline calcium.

## Digitalis, Progesterone, and the Staircase Effect

**Andrew Murray:** I understood the basic mechanism of treatment to be diuretics, to remove excess water, and plant derivatives like digoxin from the woolly foxglove as a strengthener of heart contraction.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That steroid from the foxglove is similar in structure and function to progesterone. Albert Szent-Györgyi did experiments 50 or 60 years ago in which he showed that progesterone acts on the heart like digitalis to increase the "staircase effect" of heart contraction. This is where a faster stimulation increases the stroke and amount of blood pumped with each contraction. That's because the progesterone or the digitalis is accelerating the ability to both contract and relax.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, because it's the relaxation that is the important phase for the next contraction to be functional.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's why the failing heart has a very weak, small beat—because it isn't relaxed and it's becoming harder just by being filled up with water.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned this staircase effect. I always believed that the increasing contractions of the heart were a mechanism to compensate for the lack of blood volume being ejected.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you're exercising, you will notice the beats per minute increase as you use your muscles and consume more oxygen. But at the same time that your healthy heart is beating faster, it's beating harder. So when it's going maybe 130 beats per minute, it will also be thumping very hard. You can feel your pulse as a big bulging throb with each beat. That's the staircase effect: it's both going faster and having a bigger stroke with each contraction.

## Growing Pains and Thyroid Function

**Andrew Murray:** You've explained the waterlogged effect of cardiac muscles in congestive heart failure. This has a relationship to growing pains, doesn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It turns out that exactly the same things are happening in skeletal muscle and heart muscle. Doctors have seen the changes in their patients for 100 years and found that thyroid would correct those problems of both the heart and the skeletal muscles.

Fairly recently, with analysis of genes and proteins, you can see that exactly the same things are involved in growing pains, which come with somewhat low thyroid function. Around puberty—usually a couple of years before—estrogen is increasing, blocking thyroid function. That makes the cell fatigue more easily, so it retains water. The pain is usually in the late afternoon and evening; the muscles have progressively retained more water and calcium, becoming painful and swollen.

If a person in middle age becomes very hypothyroid, they start getting the same thing. Fibromyalgia is one of the variations on that. The muscle disease of hypothyroidism, or hypothyroid myopathy, involves leakage of enzymes from the skeletal muscles. But in fact, the heart is also leaking those proteins. You can identify proteins coming from both the heart muscle and the skeletal muscles in hypothyroidism or in heart failure.

**Andrew Murray:** So you can pick these up in the blood or urine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Creatine kinase is the first thing to look for if you're suspecting a thyroid-related pain problem.

## Diagnosing Hypothyroidism: The Reflex Test

**Andrew Murray:** How do you understand the myopathy, the muscle weakness in hypothyroidism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In hypothyroidism, you can see it in an electrocardiogram or if you kneel and have someone thump your Achilles tendon. If your thyroid function is good, the relaxation will be instantaneous—your foot will relax with a floppy, instantaneous, complete relaxation. If your thyroid is low, it'll come back slowly to exactly where it started.

The heart is doing the same thing with a prolongation of the QT interval. The T wave represents repolarization or relaxation. When that is slow, that means the cell is retaining water and calcium. In that swollen state, it is permeable; it absorbs things that it shouldn't and it leaks some of the enzymes that it shouldn't leak.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this related to someone's reflexes in general? If someone has very quick reflexes, is that a sign of a well-functioning thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, the rate of nervous conduction is slowed in hypothyroidism. A hypothyroid person will tend to react 10 or 20 milliseconds slower than a person with good thyroid function.

**Andrew Murray:** For those listening, if you want to test your own reflexes: kneel on a chair facing the back so your legs are hanging off. Have someone gently tap your Achilles tendon. It's how quickly it returns to its resting state that is the important marker. If they swing out and back down quickly, that's the good sign.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Another way of looking at that reflex system is insomnia. Many doctors think that thyroid is a stimulant that will make you stay awake. But when you think of the brain as having exactly the same process of excitation and relaxation as your heart or leg muscle, when the brain is fatigued—if it's somewhat hypothyroid—it gets the equivalent of a growing pain or a cramp and it can't relax fully. That amounts to insomnia. If you can energize the brain cells, you can get sleep to come on quickly. Active thyroid hormone, magnesium, and sugar are the things that most quickly will restore energy to your brain or your muscles.

## Diet for Heart Health

**Andrew Murray:** We have a question about the best foods for the heart.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Fruit is extremely important, as is avoiding polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). The heart is much more efficient using oxygen when it's burning sugar rather than fat. Also, having plenty of all the minerals: calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Those interact very closely.

People think of calcium as the exciting ion, which it is when the cell is excited and can't get rid of it. But calcium happens to inhibit some of the hormones that maintain inflammation and excitation. So if you are well saturated with all of these alkaline minerals, that will help the heart to relax more quickly and then contract more quickly.

**Andrew Murray:** So calcium from milk or eggshells, and potassium and magnesium from fruits?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Orange juice and watermelon, for example, are good for sodium and potassium. One point about sodium is that if you restrict sodium, you increase your aldosterone. One of the current interests in heart drug treatment is to find an aldosterone inhibitor. But eating enough sodium is the simplest way to inhibit aldosterone.

**Andrew Murray:** It's too cheap and they can't patent it.

## Caller: Seizures and Hormones

**Caller (Phillipsville):** My father died of a heart attack, and since I learned from Dr. Peat that estrogen can cause heart attacks, I feel like that's what happened. I have a grand mal seizure about once a month, known as catamenial epilepsy, because of the ratio between estrogen and progesterone. What can I do to balance my hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keep your cholesterol level up. Fruit is one of the best ways to help the liver make enough cholesterol. If your cholesterol production is good, thyroid and vitamin A are the main things for turning cholesterol into progesterone. Progesterone not only has anti-seizure effects, but it has heart-protective effects—steadying the heart rhythm the way digitalis does and blocking aldosterone, preventing fibrosis of the heart.

**Caller:** Is that operative in the gut, like eating the raw grated carrot?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The effect of having a raw carrot every day, or bamboo shoots, is that these are antiseptic fibers which can't be easily broken down by microorganisms. They don't stimulate bacterial growth; in fact, they tend to sterilize the intestine. At the same time, the fiber binds to the estrogen which your liver is producing and excreting in the bile, preventing it from being reabsorbed. You can see a decrease in your estrogen level a day or two after eating a raw carrot. That reduction of absorption of bacterial products and estrogen very quickly reduces your stress and cortisol production, which allows your progesterone to increase.

**Caller:** What about the GAPS diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The simplest thing is to avoid starches and polyunsaturated fat. Olive oil is saturated enough that it helps the carrot with a germicidal action. Coconut oil, butter, and olive oil, especially associated with the fiber of carrot, help to suppress microorganisms.

## Caller: Recovering from SSRIs

**Caller (Minnesota):** What can a person do to recover from getting off of SSRIs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I hear that a lot. Basically, it's doing everything you can to restore a good, intense metabolic rate—restore the energy level of cells so that they don't go into the stress state. The high serotonin trains the nervous system to stay in a stress state because serotonin activates the pituitary ACTH and adrenal system. Ultimately, the way to break that pattern is to increase your cellular energy production, lower stress, keep your thyroid function up, and keep the estrogen down.

**Caller:** Is it something that takes quite a long time to recover from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People seem to take about a year to feel fairly normal again, even doing everything right. The serotonin itself creates an inflammatory state in the nerves and body in general. It affects your whole metabolism, tending to increase fat production and stress. You want to concentrate on keeping your whole body in an unstressed condition. Eating frequently is probably one of the helpful things—not forcing yourself to go on adrenaline.

**Andrew Murray:** We also have a note from a listener regarding a website called drugawareness.org and a contact named Ann Blake Tracy who has information about getting off SSRIs.

## Caller: Cell Phones, Bamboo, and Orange Juice

**Caller (David from Missouri):** I see people put a cell phone in their pocket right over their heart. What do you think the ramifications are of having that competing frequency right next to the heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's pretty well established that you damage the tissue and create stress in the brain. The cancer rate increases when your head is exposed to the microwave frequencies.

**Caller:** Regarding bamboo sprouts, I've been steaming them or boiling them. Do you think there's a benefit in not cooking them too much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, they still have good fiber even if they're soft.

**Caller:** I've been drinking the water I boil them in. Is there antibiotic material in that water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The Japanese and Chinese have drugs made from ferment extracts of the bamboo plant. I think there is the same antiseptic and probably anti-cancer material in the shoots.

**Caller:** Regarding orange juice, I can't always get fresh oranges. I've read that companies use enzymes to break up the pulp. Is there still a benefit from drinking processed orange juices like Tropicana?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There is a worse process where they use enzymes to break up the pulp to have less waste, but even with frozen orange juice concentrate, you can see a very quick relief from mild heart pains just by drinking a pint of orange juice per day.

## Caller: Sinusitis and Endotoxins

**Caller (Miranda):** I have chronic sinusitis that I've had for 10 years. I've been feeling like it might be straining my heart. Can a chronic infection affect the heart?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think there is a definite relation between sinus or tooth infections and the heart, but I don't think it goes *from* the sinus or tooth to the heart. I think it's endotoxin from chronic intestinal inflammation. Sometimes bacteria enter the bloodstream along with the endotoxin, but just the endotoxin alone is enough to cause sinusitis and inflamed periodontal tissues. At the same time, it's causing those changes in the heart: calcium retention, water retention, and easy fatigability.

**Caller:** I have a vegan diet and have been strictly off gluten. I can't seem to get ahead of the sinusitis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When simple foods and fibers to disinfect your intestine aren't enough, the drugs that are most helpful in my experience are aspirin and antihistamines—Benadryl, for example, or cyproheptadine, which is an anti-serotonin antihistamine.

**Caller:** What about colloidal silver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One other thing that helps the general immune system and avoidance of inflammation is vitamin D.

**Caller:** I take 10,000 units of Vitamin D3 a day. Is that reasonable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, if it's vitamin D3, it is.

## Cholesterol and Statins

**Andrew Murray:** We were discussing cholesterol earlier. You were talking about the harmful effects of lowering cholesterol and its relevance to heart failure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the accepted side effects of both of the main categories of cholesterol-lowering drugs is occasional muscle breakdown—rhabdomyolysis—where the muscle dissolves itself. One known factor is the interference with the production of Coenzyme Q10, but that isn't the sole reason.

The simple lack of cholesterol is a problem. Cholesterol is a cell-stabilizing substance with hormone-like action. In the absence of progesterone and the other protective steroids, cholesterol actually has a cell-protective effect in the skeletal muscles and in the heart. The same process that causes rhabdomyolysis in skeletal muscles can happen in the heart: cholesterol deficiency tending to kill heart cells.

**Andrew Murray:** You recommend having a cholesterol of 200, especially if someone is over 50.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The Framingham study found that people over 50 who had at least 200 cholesterol or higher had a much lower risk of Alzheimer's disease because it's brain-protective as well as heart-protective.

## Caller: Tooth Infection and Raw Vegetables

**Caller (Trinidad):** I am dealing with a tooth infection that I've had for a number of years. I've been treating it with tea tree oil.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know a dentist who cured chronic dental problems like periodontal disease simply by giving his patients a laxative. He found there was no need to do periodontal surgery if he cleared the intestine.

**Caller:** I'm pretty regular, though my digestion is a little sluggish.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes just avoiding starches, and especially raw vegetables and raw fibrous fruits, helps. Apples are easier on the intestine if they're well cooked, and vegetables ought to be cooked about 40 minutes to be protective to the intestine.

**Caller:** So avoid raw vegetables?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. We don't have enzymes for breaking up the cellulose of vegetable material. The bacteria are favored by the warm, moist conditions in the gut and can thrive on raw vegetables. Raw carrots are the exception because, being a root vegetable, they happen to be very germicidal. Bacteria won't touch them.

**Caller:** Do you know anything about light therapies? A friend has a box that gives off red rays.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sunlight is the best in general, provided you avoid sunburn. Many hours a day of brilliant white light, incandescent light, or sunlight has many effects: balancing the hormones and increasing your defensive hormones such as progesterone and testosterone. Just a year or so ago, an American researcher found that shining red light on rats' heads improved their learning because red light penetrates through the tissues. It helps your whole system, lowers stress, and probably lowers the tendency to absorb endotoxin through your intestine.
