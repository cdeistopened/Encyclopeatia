## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this September 2018 edition of *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. We are a free speech, free enterprise station funded by you, the public. Last month, we discussed critical thinking and cover-ups. We are an independent program, and often you will listen to people exposing things you have likely never heard of before. It is very important to have free speech; it is one of the bedrocks of the American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

Last month, we discussed the beginning of critical thinking regarding medical trials. Anyone can go to PubMed or the National Library databases to find clinical trials. However, some of these trials are done by people with an agenda. Whether or not we want to believe that drug companies have their own vested interests and that less-than-stellar results are covered up, I think it is undeniable. When drugs come out and are pulled after a couple of years after causing heart attacks or other serious events, that happens, and we have plenty of evidence behind that. But in the meantime, billions of dollars have been made.

For every good article on the internet, you are going to find some bad articles. It takes a modicum of science and intelligent pursuit to filter it out. Once again, we are joined by Dr. Raymond Peat for his wealth of experience on the matter. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks for joining us. Could you give an outline of your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was a linguistics teacher for a while before I decided to get a PhD in biology. In 1968, I enrolled at the University of Oregon in the Biology department and worked there for four years, largely on reproductive physiology. Right after that, I went back to my interest in linguistics, philosophy, and consciousness—how the brain knows the world—and worked on a book on brain physiology. After I finished that, I got involved in nutrition counseling. So, there has been a lot of interest in the neurological and psychological effects of hormones and nutrition.

## Evidence-Based Medicine and Ideology

**Andrew Murray:** That leads me to "evidence-based medicine." It depends entirely on a reliable base of evidence. If the evidence base is tampered with or paid for, then evidence-based medicine as a science is pretty useless. We have financial conflicts of interest and the selling of science as a marketing initiative. What do you think about evidence-based medicine in terms of what you have found over the last four decades?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few hundred years ago, when there was an established religion, it determined what people could believe philosophically. As science, physics, and biology took over from the established religion, they became the established religion in its place. The people in the universities and established research institutions—often under the control of the government—tell the public what they should believe, exactly the way the medieval church used to. They absolutely require conforming belief. They don't burn you now for dissenting from science, but metaphorically they might; they kick you out of universities and any good social position if you really dissent.

The authoritarian aspect of medicine peaked when this idea of evidence-based medicine, based on these big multi-million dollar, multi-year studies, became a nominal standard. Most of what doctors do has nothing to do with that, but it is a way of enforcing certain practices and kicking out doctors who don't want to conform. It has to be either a giant industry or the government working with those industries to fund these huge research projects. In many of these major studies, for example in AIDS drugs, the corruption has been documented. Some of the institutions participating simply put in phony information to support the sale of the drugs they wanted to sell.

**Andrew Murray:** This is collusion between the government and the corporations that have the financial wherewithal to pull this off.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In many ways, the institutions have controlled the governments and the universities. At one time, the land grant colleges were a way of letting science help the farmers. The county extension agents and the Department of Agriculture for a time actually put out useful information. But they were soon taken over by the industries. Now, for example, over at Oregon State University, the insecticide, herbicide, and radiation industries really set the tone for what they are doing.

## SSRIs and Serotonin

**Andrew Murray:** I want to talk about specific drugs. The Hippocratic oath says "first do no harm," yet we have the repeated example of SSRIs. These commonly prescribed antidepressants have label warnings regarding the risk of suicide, violence, and homicide. In 2007, the FDA admitted that SSRIs can cause madness at all ages.

I found an article from 1960 on cyproheptadine, which is an anti-serotonin agent, discussing how beneficial it was. It seems strange that today we are prescribed SSRIs to block the uptake of serotonin—making it more available—when cyproheptadine, an anti-serotonin agent, showed positive benefits. What is your view on SSRIs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They talk about different generations of antidepressants. The first generation was the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors that increased your adrenaline along with dopamine and serotonin. When the patents expired on that first generation, they wanted to sell new products. They had to find reasons to get people to stop those—which often worked very well—and move on to a new product.

They said, "Well, it must have been the serotonin increase produced by the first generation," so they came up with a new way to increase serotonin. However, there was a study where they tried to treat vicious dogs by increasing their serotonin, which was supposedly the "serenity and bliss" transmitter. They found that the aggressive, vicious dogs actually had high serotonin. When they gave them the SSRI, their serotonin went down as they became pleasant dogs. So, something which has been sold to millions of people to increase their serotonin actually sometimes does have good effects, but most likely by *lowering* serotonin.

**Andrew Murray:** You’ve mentioned serotonin many times as an inflammatory molecule.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is known to cause blood clotting, spasms of coronary and other arteries, and inflammation. The latest horrible thing is that it is a major factor in osteoporosis. The excess serotonin produced by an inflamed intestine creates osteoporosis.

**Andrew Murray:** A 1975 article in a Polish pharmacology journal connected the gut to the formation of migraines. You have long mentioned serotonin in the gut as an inflammatory mediator.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has been a major project of the medical industry. In the 19th century, the intestine was a central part of medical understanding, right at the core of how the body works. With the beginning of organized, so-called scientific medicine, there was a campaign to wean doctors away from the use of laxatives and enemas, claiming they were dangerous or addictive. They moved doctors into more mechanical treatments. But if you look at the endotoxin studies starting 20 or 30 years ago, you see that they were on the right track in the 19th century. Now it is turning out that endotoxin, serotonin, and histamine are major factors in everything that goes wrong in the organism.

**Andrew Murray:** Cascara and cassia are anthraquinone-containing herbs that have laxative properties. Because endotoxin formation from constipation has such negative sequelae, there is almost a campaign against manufacturers that produce these products.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is actually an FDA conspiracy. They have gone through a series of natural substances, killing general access to them as far as possible and assigning all rights to one company, which then increases the price a hundredfold, basically making it impossible to use the cheap, natural herbal form.

## Caller: Skin Rash, Probiotics, and Glandulars

**Caller (New York):** I have a follow-up question regarding a skin rash. I've been doing the dry CO2 and salt baths you mentioned, and it has gotten a lot better. I added probiotics—about 15 strains—and I think it has been helpful. I also added desiccated thymus, adrenal, and hypothalamus glands. Also, I am using Vitamin E and CoQ10 topically. What do you think?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Getting the ideal intestinal flora would be extremely important, but it is very hard to do, so it takes a lot of trial and error. Yogurt works for lots of people, but sometimes it takes other bacteria. My experience is that the antibiotic substances produced by *Bacillus subtilis* and *Bacillus licheniformis* are very helpful. Also, the bacteriophage—a virus that kills specific bacteria, including E. coli—can be helpful.

**Andrew Murray:** Are these bacteriophages available?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A few are available, for example through the Life Extension Foundation, but other companies are making a bigger variety available now. Most of the work for the last 70 years has been in Eastern Europe, and it is just now catching on in the U.S.

**Andrew Murray:** What about the glandulars?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are at least good nutrition. Some of them do have active agents; for example, adrenal cortex contains a fair amount of pregnenolone.

**Andrew Murray:** And the topical Vitamin E and CoQ10?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good. They are poorly absorbed, but you do absorb some, and it is very helpful.

## Caller: Migraines and Violence

**Caller:** You were saying something about migraine headaches pertaining to the gut. Was there a suggestion that keeping the bowels moving, like with enemas, would help with migraines?

**Andrew Murray:** Definitely. The endotoxin issue surrounding poor gut motility is responsible for inflammation, which causes a reflex action triggering migraines via vasoconstriction. Dr. Peat, could you clarify your understanding of migraines in relation to serotonin and endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your blood sugar is low, your intestine is very touchy and has exaggerated reflexes. Stretching it, bulging it with gas or constipation, or chemical inflammation from endotoxin—any of those irritations is exaggerated when blood sugar is low. A good diet, making sure your thyroid function is good to stabilize your blood sugar, can greatly reduce the incidence of migraines because your intestine loses that hypersensitivity.

**Caller:** I also have a comment regarding psychotropic drugs and violence. A few years ago, a radio program listed 75 people who committed mass murders and the drugs they were on or had just come off of. The news channels briefly mentioned it but then pushed it under the carpet, probably due to pharmaceutical pressure. There is obviously a correlation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly.

**Andrew Murray:** The FDA actually made a public statement about this in 2007.

## Caller: World Power Structures

**Caller (London, Ontario):** I’ve heard you talk about government agencies like the CIA and FBI. Who do you feel is at the top of the pyramid of world power?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Generally, people with poor judgment and bad information are in control.

**Andrew Murray:** Let's leave it at that. It is a mixture of greed, money, and power.

## Estrogens and Cancer Risk

**Andrew Murray:** To wrap up the SSRI topic: the fact that they produce an SSRI when serotonin is an inflammatory molecule involved with dysbiosis is madness. Moving on, let's talk about estrogens.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogens synergize with radiation and stress. Estrogen is sort of an ultimate stress-related hormone, like histamine and serotonin. They have their place in tissue renewal, but that place should be limited to a few hours following any trauma or tissue injury.

**Andrew Murray:** You've always said estrogen's main function is inflammatory, for implantation or injury repair.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If that cell renewal process continues, then cell renewal turns into a tumor.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an advertisement for a product called Delestrogen from November 2017. It said in big bold letters: "Estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the publications in the medical journals over the years have claimed that estrogen is good for more than 200 different disease conditions, all of which were proved false.

## Caller: B Vitamins and Supplements

**Caller (Long Island):** Most B vitamins are synthetic and not in the right ratio. I was thinking that nutritional yeast, which has B vitamins in a natural ratio plus selenium, would be a better way to go, despite the small amount of estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Nutritional yeast does have a good range of B vitamins. The drawbacks, besides the small amount of estrogen, are indigestible starch and high phosphate content. If you use it as a supplement for several days, it is okay, but you don't want to use it as a major part of your diet because of that high phosphate content, unless you take measures to balance it with calcium.

**Andrew Murray:** Are there any good vitamins out there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I stopped using oral vitamins in the 1970s because I had some extreme allergic reactions to vitamin B2 and folic acid. Being yellow-colored, they are absorbers of visible light, causing chemical reactions to happen. That means before you get them into your mouth, they are likely to have been exposed to oxygen and radiation that has activated free radical processes, making them a pretty bad risk for allergy.

**Caller:** One other question. You mentioned magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate. If they are less bioavailable, wouldn't the body treat them as toxins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Magnesium supplements very often cause migraines and asthma symptoms because of some contaminant in them. However, in your stomach, the acid generally will turn much of the supplement, such as magnesium carbonate, into magnesium chloride, which is instantly absorbed.

## Caller: High Blood Pressure and Lisinopril

**Caller (Northern California):** I am 77 years old. I have had some high thyroid issues. My blood pressure goes between 170 and 144. I have a bottle of Lisinopril but haven't taken it yet. What is your approach to high blood pressure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Big doses of Vitamin K often cure it in just a week or two. Getting enough calcium in your diet, especially in relation to phosphate, and Vitamin D are extremely important. If you can't do it with good nutrition, then of all the medical approaches I know of, the angiotensin blockers and the ACE inhibitors [like Lisinopril] are the safest.

**Caller:** How much Vitamin K would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know people who lowered their chronically extremely high blood pressure—over 200 over 100—down to the normal range within a week or two by taking 30 to 50 milligrams a day and then stopping.

**Andrew Murray:** It is generally a liquid. Thorne Research does a liquid Vitamin K2.

**Caller:** And how much Vitamin D?

**Andrew Murray:** You want about 4,000 to 6,000 or 8,000 IU. It varies from person to person. You should get your blood drawn. A reference range above 30 ng/mL is standard, but somewhere in the range of 50 to 70 is probably better.

**Caller:** I also take thyroid medicine. I had my thyroid removed.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The right kind of thyroid supplement often lowers blood pressure. You want to keep your TSH fairly low, at the low end of the normal range, because TSH itself is responsible for increasing blood pressure.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** Just to wrap up, there are 2018 articles discussing bleeding induced by SSRIs and gastrointestinal bleeding risks. Don't just accept what your doctor tells you as being safe. Question it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That reminds me, just last week I heard from two people that when their doctor prescribed a certain drug, they immediately started feeling terrible—felt like it was killing them. I asked, "Why don't you stop it?" They both said, "My appointment isn't for two or three weeks yet, and I can't stop it until the doctor takes me off it."

**Andrew Murray:** The doctor is elevated to a supernatural position. It is bizarre.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One study found that a small dose of cyproheptadine was effective against lymphoma.

**Andrew Murray:** Yet here we are in 2018, and cyproheptadine is buried while SSRIs are prescribed. We are out of time. Dr. Peat can be reached at `www.raypeat.com` for fully referenced articles. Thank you for your time, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.
