## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to this evening's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who have just tuned in for the first time, we hold a monthly discussion on various topics with Dr. Raymond Peat, using his wealth of expertise to add to what may or may not be known.

This month's topic is about diagnosis as a double-edged sword, looking at shamanism and other spiritual healing modalities. We will also look at cultural ideas—how they develop and how language is used sometimes as a tool against us, and other times as a tool to further our understanding. A lot of scientific research doesn't make it to the public sphere for quite some time. We go through suffering, being told that liquid oils, for example, are heart-healthy and lower our cholesterol, when actually the exact opposite happens. Forty or fifty years later we get an admission, but it's too late for a lot of people by that point.

We will cover diagnosis, environmental enrichment, and nootropics. I wanted to start the show with Dr. Peat's latest newsletter. He included a sentence: "First deny that harm is done." We know the Hippocratic oath is "first do no harm," but medicine since the 1930s or 40s has been doing a lot of harm. Unfortunately, due to advertising and corporate planning, we aren't told the full story.

My thoughts went to Native American, South American, and Aboriginal cultures where ritualistic dream quests—typically involving some mind-body disengagement—counteract the "kiss of death" given by Western medicine's diagnosis. This is achieved through the environmental enrichment of the quest and the interpretation of healing as a journey.

Dr. Peat wrote: "Where the organism is working meaningfully, useless structures tend to atrophy as new structures develop." The "meaningful" aspect is the environmental enrichment of the pursuit of creativity, altruism, and selflessness. I believe this can bring about what Dr. Peat quotes as an "unveiling of new possibilities for reorganization and repair," which is akin to a cure.

I don't doubt the substances Dr. Peat supports affect physiology for the good of the organism. I also understand that antibiotics would have halted the Black Death. However, I am sure the older arts worked on a more subtle energy underpinning physiology, psychology, and spirituality as a unified system. Let me introduce Dr. Peat. Are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for sharing on the show. For those hearing you for the first time, would you outline your professional and academic background?

## Linguistics, Biology, and Noam Chomsky

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As a new graduate student in the 1950s, I tried several different departments but mostly concentrated on linguistics and the psychology of language. I dropped out of several departments before going back to get a PhD. After I got my master's degree with a thesis on William Blake, I went back to study biology, intending to investigate how the brain can function in ways that could explain intelligence and language use.

I was partly reacting against Noam Chomsky's doctrine. When I began thinking about linguistics in the late 1950s, he was just taking over the culture of language theory. I considered him one of the great evils of our culture. The way he was treating language left the brain and intelligence out of the whole thing. It became a motor program, actually, for following rules laid down in the genes.

**Andrew Murray:** What was he a proponent of in terms of that discussion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He explicitly said that the behavior that allows us to make language and follow grammatical rules must be in the genes. This is very much the way Konrad Lorenz said that all of our behavior is in the genes, and so to improve the species, we have to kill inferior people. Chomsky doesn't say that, but he has a very arrogant attitude towards people who question his very arbitrary genetic explanation of things.

**Andrew Murray:** So it's a bit like Neo-Darwinism and Mendelian situations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it is a kind of cultural arrogance based in MIT with all the power of the Pentagon behind it. Over the years, I found that he had penetrated every department of universities. A friend and I did a course in the honors college at the University of Oregon on interdepartmental views of human nature. We invited ten different professors—the ones students thought were outstanding in their area—to speak. Each one of them said that his department's contribution to understanding human nature was Noam Chomsky's generative grammar. Sociology, folklore, literature—all the different departments at that time, 1968, thought Noam Chomsky had defined the world for them.

**Andrew Murray:** Oh my goodness. So within education at that point, there was this lie being spread and seeded rapidly through different domains that all agreed on the same thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You can trace it back to the beginning of the 20th century, financed by various corporate and military interests. All the powers interested in expanding their power were promoting research and teaching in areas that presented a very arbitrary and degraded picture of human nature.

## Hormesis and Industrial Pollution

**Andrew Murray:** Looking at your newsletter, you mentioned heroic medicine 200 years ago. The "healing crisis" was a defective understanding, seeking to treat with the use of mercury and arsenic. Then we moved to the concept of hormesis 50 years ago. Would you speak about this planting of concepts in our mind to create a false narrative?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea of genes determining the nature of a species had its theological advocates in the 19th century. That genetic definition created a fixed, unchanging organism where accidents were the only things that could change the genes.

On top of that understanding, by the 1940s, industries started producing a reaction to their polluting processes. Atomic bombs were being exploded in Nevada, poisoning everyone downwind all the way to New York. People were getting concerned about the quality of air and water; city smog was killing people. The industries started fighting back, saying, "Look at history; if something didn't kill you, it made you stronger."

**Andrew Murray:** We do hear that, don't we?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you survived the mercury treatment, you were supposedly cured and a strong, healthy organism, even though mercury stayed with you.

**Andrew Murray:** This was the original heroic medicine, and then it morphed into the atomic bomb testing era.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Industries started funneling huge amounts of money. One current professor in Boston has received more than $40 million in research to promote this phony idea of hormesis. About 15 years ago, they started defining it as a biphasic response, meaning a small amount moves biology in one direction, and a larger amount moves it in the other. Basically, the idea was that a little bit of poison is good for you.

They argued that the leak from the nuclear industry and atomic fallout were "low-level radiation." They used upside-down evidence to argue that this pollution was actually causing biological benefit. That developed into the argument by big think tanks that the government should stop regulating industrial pollution because the regulation is causing damage to public health by denying us the "beneficial" pollution.

**Andrew Murray:** It takes a long time for the wool to be pulled from our eyes. We hear that polyunsaturated oils are great, or fluoride is good for us. All the time they tell us it's for our own good and use this hormesis mechanism to justify it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even though John Gofman was a major government nuclear researcher, he eventually started looking at the facts. He gathered evidence showing that most cancer and a large part of heart disease in the United States can be traced to medical X-rays. My brother, who worked in the nuclear industry for most of his life, said that every week they had a seminar teaching them about the benefits of low-level radiation.

**Andrew Murray:** X-rays are so ubiquitous. You go to a dentist or the ER, and they want to X-ray or CT scan. GE is heavily invested in their old technology and needs to recoup costs.

## Shamanism vs. Western Diagnosis

**Andrew Murray:** Getting away from the concept of brainwashing, I've long held the belief that diagnosis can be one of the most dangerous things. For someone to hear they've been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease can be the "kiss of death" because of the strong mind-body connection. In shamanistic medicine, the healer is a mediator to a spirit realm where a different interpretation exists. What are your views on the mind-body-spirit approach to healing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think what you're calling the shamanistic view is the simple, basic reality. The world that the scientists and government people are advocating is a world of manipulation, control, and enforced agreement. If you back away from the academic orthodoxy, you see some of the reality that the shamans are working with. It is a basic participation in the world around you. All organisms do it. The shaman's therapeutic reality is to get the person back in touch with the complex realities they are living in, rather than being attached to the story they are being brought up with.

**Andrew Murray:** It is important to pull people out of this dream state. That view of non-ordinary reality is important for practitioners trying to get into the psyche of a sick person.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of people ask me about a cancer diagnosis they've had. When I ask them exactly how the diagnosis was made and what the actual observations were, they are sometimes annoyed that I question the simple fact that they have terminal cancer. But almost nine times out of ten, it turns out the diagnosis was very exaggerated. They are given the impression that invasion is underway, but if you look at the actual pictures, they basically have slightly abnormal tissue. If you press the pathologist, they'll say, "Well, it's abnormal, it will undoubtedly turn into cancer, so it's good to get rid of it."

## Carbon Monoxide and Antioxidants

**Andrew Murray:** Regarding the idea that a little bit of something harmful is good for you: most people agree carbon monoxide is toxic. But then I hear people using nitric oxide, or Laetrile (apricot seeds containing hydrogen cyanide) being useful for cancer. What do you think about those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The composition of city smog is rich in carbon monoxide and nitric oxide. It is interesting that these have now become medically and biologically "desirable." It makes the fear of smog go away if you think they are a defense. They are calling carbon monoxide a very powerful anti-inflammatory agent.

**Andrew Murray:** Carbon monoxide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It happens to make city smog look beneficial. But when you look at how it is produced in the body, it breaks down the heme group, which is involved in all our essential oxidative metabolic processes inside the cell. As it breaks down heme, it releases a molecule of carbon monoxide and an atom of iron. The iron acts randomly as an oxidant.

The first step of degrading heme produces biliverdin, which is quickly turned into bilirubin. Bilirubin is being touted as a powerful anti-inflammatory antioxidant. Something I've been pointing out for many years is that cancer is extremely endowed with antioxidant processes. That is why it can resist chemotherapy and radiation so well.

What makes a cell healthy is the whole system of oxidative processes. If you plug up the oxidative machinery, you go into a reduced state. That is the antioxidant power of a cancer cell. You get the process of inhibiting respiratory enzymes by both carbon monoxide and bilirubin. At the same time, bilirubin excites the nerve cells. This is exactly the formula for excitotoxic death of brain cells. Yet, it is called a powerful protective antioxidant.

**Andrew Murray:** So cancer evades treatment because it has enzymes that turn off the oxidative process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It turns off the oxidative process, producing things like lactic acid, which is a reductant.

**Andrew Murray:** It took me a while to get this concept because dietary supplements and foods are advertised for their ability to be antioxidants. I always understood "antioxidant" to be beneficial. But you're saying oxidants, like Vitamin E and C, are actually the beneficial substances?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a healthy cell, Vitamin C exists in the oxidizing form. It stabilizes the structure of the cell by keeping things from being excessively reduced. Vitamin E fits into that mixture too.

## Perception and Brain Plasticity

**Andrew Murray:** How does the doctrine of hormesis work into our consciousness? Medical abstracts no longer reside in libraries, and real data is hard to find. What is actually proposed in many papers does not reflect the true science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The theory of consciousness and the brain that is repeatedly taught fits the picture beneficial to industry. They want to present the brain as having programs that are genetically determined or trained by "adaptive learning"—repetition rather than insight. This programmed behavior tends to be digital or have concrete symbolic units.

However, the actual organism deals with holistic, rich patterns. A book called *Eye and Brain* by Gregory in the 60s showed that if you look at different images with each eye, the brain integrates millions of points of information to create a three-dimensional image. That kind of sensory assimilation is denied by the culture that wants controllable, educable people who deal only in symbolic forms.

**Andrew Murray:** It is another example of the reductionist worldview.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Logic and math are distractions from the way the organism is integrating its information.

**Andrew Murray:** What will it take for medicine to change and do no harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It will take the public recognizing the extent of the harm. I've seen it happen locally where it only took four or five patients standing up to the doctors to change them 180 degrees. Doctors feel trapped by the system just as much as the patients.

**Andrew Murray:** You mentioned that substances like pregnenolone, carbon dioxide, glucose, and warmth can affect brain growth during development. Do you think supplementation later in life can make up for a lack of these earlier, or is there a finite window for reorganization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Every night we produce masses of stem cells that attempt to renew worn-out tissues. With age, things like polyunsaturated fats, iron, and bilirubin accumulate, making it hard for stem cells to do full repair. Instead of repair, we get fibrosis. But with the right support—both in how the person uses their brain and access to environmental needs—I think at any stage those repair cells can be integrated.

**Andrew Murray:** This supports the idea that sleep is important for repair. You advocate for nine hours or more?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the winter when days are short, more sleep is protective. I've seen examples where very damaged brains show radical restructuring quickly. It is like the brain knows how to rebuild itself when given the opportunity.

**Andrew Murray:** You stated that epigenetic changes produced by stress are reversible, but reversal becomes less likely with age if the environment remains the same. Polyunsaturated fats amplify this by generating carbon monoxide and prostaglandins. Do you see environmental enrichment as paramount to drive change?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see adaptation as constantly choosing between two directions: one is to become more, to know more, and move into the future; the other is defensive adaptation, simply surviving. Stressed parents tend to have babies with less functional brains. At any point, the brain is eager to repair itself, but if the background has been restricted, the repair situation must be more intense. The conscious attitude has to be deliberate to avoid learned helplessness. You must seek things that stop the production of prostaglandins and reduce the storage of polyunsaturated fats—substances like aspirin and progesterone.

## Caller: Monounsaturated Fats

**Caller:** I've been hearing you mention polyunsaturated fats quite a lot. What about monounsaturated fats, like olive oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Monounsaturated fats are fine; they are very much a part of our nature. If we eat nothing but sugar, we will make monounsaturated fats of our own. Those are the n-9 (omega-9) fats, like in olive oil and butter. From that n-9 series, we produce our own polyunsaturated fats called the n-9 series.

It is the lack of those which is the damage done when we eat things like soy oil and safflower oil. They inhibit our ability to produce our own polyunsaturated fats, which are stable and beneficial.

**Caller:** You're saying it's better to consume the sugars that will help us produce that in our bodies as opposed to putting it in our food?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some research has found organisms that will make the equivalent n-9 series polyunsaturated fats, and they are very protective anti-inflammatory agents. They are the things we would be producing if we weren't poisoned by PUFA.

**Caller:** What is the major difference between monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mono are almost always the n-9 fats, like oleic acid. Crops that grow in cold climates, like soybeans or seaweed, cannot use saturated fats. They produce their own polyunsaturated fats (n-3, n-6) to remain fluid in cold weather. Those fats are unstable when you make them as warm as we are (98.6°F). They cause very quick oxidative breakdown.

## Caller: Hypothyroidism and Heat Intolerance

**Caller:** I saw a study on PubMed about hypothyroidism, heat intolerance, and anxiety. I have that. I wake up with a low temperature, but I am very sensitive to heat and become overheated quickly.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you checked your temperature during the times when you're feeling overheated?

**Caller:** It usually doesn't seem that high, never usually more than 99.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you are really hypothyroid and have, say, a 97-degree temperature when you wake up, it's important to keep taking your temperature and pulse rate during the day. Lots of people who have discomfort in the heat have very high nitric oxide production. That causes vasodilation and reddening of the skin, but that will lower the core temperature. To understand what's happening metabolically, check your temperature before and after those experiences of heat intolerance.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** I have to stop us there. Thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat. His website is well-researched, and you will find things there you won't find anywhere else: www.raypeat.com. Thanks for listening, and we will see you next year. Good night.
