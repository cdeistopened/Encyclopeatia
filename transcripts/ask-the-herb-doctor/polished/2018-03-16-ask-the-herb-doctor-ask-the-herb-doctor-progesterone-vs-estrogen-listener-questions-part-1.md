## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray. We are very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. For those in the area, the number is 707-923-3911. For those outside the area, the 800 number is 1-800-568-3723.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The 800 number might not work from outside of California, and almost certainly not internationally.

**Andrew Murray:** In January, we discussed the continuing misconceptions surrounding progesterone and the promotion of estrogen by the drug industry. The evidence clearly shows that progesterone is the protective hormone, while estrogen is the most inflammatory hormone continually secreted throughout a woman's life.

We discussed the PROTECT and SYNAPSE trials regarding progesterone's anti-inflammatory effects in traumatic brain injury. A paper published in the *Journal of Neurotrauma* (June 1, 2017) outlined why the design was flawed: suboptimal dosing, lack of Phase 2B studies, and the failure to incorporate preclinical results. It has also been inferred that the lipid emulsion into which progesterone was dissolved causes neurodegeneration in its own right.

Pregnanolone and allopregnanolone are synthesized *de novo* by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from cholesterol. These are positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor, demonstrating anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant activities similar to benzodiazepines. When progesterone levels decrease, GABA-A receptor activity declines, contributing to excitotoxic effects, insomnia, and agitation.

Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us. Could you outline your academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I got my PhD from the University of Oregon in 1972. I started studying biology there in 1968 and specialized in reproductive endocrine physiology.

**Andrew Murray:** Notably, you did a lot of research into aging. At that time, progesterone as an anti-aging product was a touchy subject because the estrogen industry was dominant, wasn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Interestingly, Donald Stein [from the progesterone brain injury studies] was studying psychology there right around the same time I was.

## Progesterone and Heart Health

**Andrew Murray:** You have mentioned that estrogen is associated with waterlogging of cells and an excitotoxic state where energy is wasted. Do you think progesterone would be useful in a heart attack if given soon enough? I know hawthorn extract reduces ischemia if given within the first few hours.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, in all sorts of crisis situations. It lowers the damage done by the interruption of oxidative processes. It lowers inflammation and helps to restore energy production. It is very parallel to the effects of T3, the active thyroid hormone. T3 helps to increase the ratio of progesterone to estrogen. T3 is equally acutely protective to the heart. Several years ago, when they were doing heart transplants, they found that if they gave the donor T3 before removing their heart, that heart was much more successfully implanted.

**Andrew Murray:** I assume thyroid works by stabilizing cells and energizing them, as opposed to the depolarized state promoted by estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In the oligodendrocytes where progesterone is produced, T3 is the active thing that promotes its production.

## CO2 and the Lactate Paradox

**Andrew Murray:** We have covered the hoax of global warming and the demonization of CO2 in the past. Early fossil records show the Earth had lush vegetation when CO2 levels were significantly higher. You have mentioned the similarities between carbon dioxide and progesterone. Could you equate the beneficial effects of CO2 to progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One more comment on the relation between T3 and progesterone is that both of them increase the production and retention of carbon dioxide.

Regarding giving progesterone for a recent heart attack: the effect of estrogen on energy production delays the restoration of the energy needed to make the heart beat. This shows up as a prolonged QT interval. Progesterone shortens that interval and makes the heart less likely to have a rhythm problem because it accelerates the ability to return to the resting, energized state.

Carbon dioxide has that same muscle-stabilizing effect. At high altitude, they have talked about the "Lactate Paradox" for many years. A person can work full force at high altitude without producing the excess lactic acid they normally would at sea level. That is because the body, at lower oxygen pressure, is able to retain a higher balance of CO2 in the tissues. That stabilizing effect in the working muscle is very similar to what progesterone is doing in the heart and brain.

**Andrew Murray:** Does this lend credence to data showing people living at high altitudes have longer lifespans?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you look at how sleep is affected under stress, when someone has altitude sickness, they develop insomnia. It is primarily low-thyroid people who develop altitude sickness because they were hyperventilating chemically even at sea level. When they go to high altitude, that low retention of CO2 shows up as an acute problem.

However, if your thyroid function is good and you are well saturated with carbon dioxide, your restful, slow-wave sleep is longer in proportion to the amount of CO2 in your tissues. They have experimented with having people sleep in atmospheres with 0.5% to 1.5% CO2. At those moderate but increased levels, there is a dramatic improvement in deep sleep.

**Andrew Murray:** Does that imply that athletes taking oxygen on the sidelines should have carbon dioxide mixed in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it should be 5% or 6% CO2 in pure oxygen. In some Mount Everest experiments, it was traditional to zip a person inside a bag with oxygen to help them recover from mountain sickness. Someone found that inside that plastic bag, they concentrated their breath CO2. They found that giving the high-altitude sickness patient pure CO2—like a 5% additive—would cure them as well as the oxygen supplement.

## Caller: High Prolactin & Thyroid

**Caller (SoCal):** I have a sibling with a history of infertility and very high prolactin levels. She cannot bring it down with thyroid (two grains a day) or progesterone. She follows your diet carefully. What else can she do?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Has she taken her temperature and pulse rate to see how she is responding to the thyroid?

**Caller (SoCal):** Yes, she does that. Do you think the medication isn't working?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is important to look at various indicators. For example, the Achilles relaxation reflex. If you kneel and have someone thump your Achilles tendon, your toe should jump out and relax like a piece of floppy rubber. In about two-thirds of the population, it comes back like it has a door closer on it. It shows up as a delayed repolarization or relaxation of the muscle when thyroid is low.

**Andrew Murray:** I've found that some people need to increase the dose quite a bit more than expected to get an effect. Is there anything else responsible for high prolactin, like a tumor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If there is a tumor secreting it, bromocriptine is almost always successful at shrinking it. But if the tumor isn't very large, you can do it just as reliably by keeping thyroid function a little above normal for two or three weeks. Watch the prolactin; you should first see the TSH go down close to zero, because the same serotonin which rises in hypothyroidism activates the production of prolactin. The TSH descent will be followed by a slower lowering of the prolactin.

**Caller (SoCal):** She also wanted to know how to safely cook mushrooms and make marmalade.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is safe to eat about a cup of well-cooked white button mushrooms every day. Just boil them. They should stay at the boiling temperature for at least an hour.

**Andrew Murray:** My wife cooks them for at least 40 minutes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are probably safe after 15 or 20 minutes, but just to be sure. Regarding marmalade, it is important to get good organic oranges. You don't want insecticide or fungicide in your marmalade.

## Caller: Blood Donation & Iron

**Caller (Finland):** I was wondering about the potential positive or negative effects of donating blood. Does it help get rid of metals? Also, could the longer lifespan of females be linked to the fact that they get rid of blood every month?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far as heart disease goes, the incidence of heart damage increases at menopause so that women become similar to men. That is probably because they had been throwing away excess iron while they were menstruating.

Besides the red cell iron that you lose, I think you can get a great benefit if you keep your red cells but donate the plasma. It might not be good for the recipient, but it is very good to get rid of some of your stress-induced microspheres.

## Caller: CO2 Training & Hair Analysis

**Caller (Joe):** Regarding CO2, you mentioned putting CO2 gas in a bag and putting your body in it. If you use that bag on a regular basis, would your body acclimate and get better at retaining CO2? Are you teaching your cells?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I think that is exactly what happens. You are training your cells to take advantage of the Lactate Paradox effect. The longer you stay under the influence of higher CO2, your bones charge up on it. If you are in a submarine for two months, you are still assimilating CO2 into your bone structure. It lasts a long time.

**Caller (Joe):** So you are training parts of your brain not to be hypersensitive to CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Estrogen makes your nerves overreactive to CO2. Under the influence of too much estrogen, everyone hyperventilates and blows out too much CO2. The CO2 temporarily anesthetizes that process and gradually trains you to stop hyperventilating. In Russian studies where they took animals up [to altitude] for six months, they were still showing greater mitochondrial efficiency at the end of their lives two years later.

**Caller (Joe):** My second question is about hair tests for toxic metals. It seems copper, iron, and manganese balance is complex. Do you believe in hair tests?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hair is extremely able to bind metals, even out of the air. So many people have copper plumbing nowadays. If your water is at all acidic, it will absorb enough copper to totally invalidate any hair test if you wash your hair. Your hair will catch all the copper from the wash water.

**Caller (Joe):** So hair tests are generally not valid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Toenail clippings are considered better, but even your toenails can soak up minerals from the water if you wash your feet too often.

**Caller (Joe):** How do you balance copper and iron over time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Generally speaking, I advocate eating shellfish because they use copper for blood instead of iron. A constant once-a-week shellfish meal will keep your copper up where it should be. With age, as you overload on iron, that tends to displace copper from the enzymes where it is used. Elastase in blood vessels tends to deteriorate as it loses copper with aging.

## Caller: Estrogen, Libido & Lyme

**Caller (Blue Lake):** I have always had high estrogen. I stopped menstruating at 55. I have Lyme and Candida issues. I've heard Reishi mushrooms can help with inflammation. Also, I have a better sex drive now than in the last 25 years, which is strange.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, you have said estrogen is responsible for sex drive, whereas testosterone is usually cited.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It takes the conversion of androgen to estrogen in certain parts of the brain to increase the libido. So it doesn't have to be in your serum.

**Caller (Blue Lake):** What about Reishi mushrooms for inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Your body will go into a chronic inflammatory state in reaction to Lyme or Candida. If you get your resistance up—using DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone—that will favor the right conversion of just the right amount of estrogen. You can boost that regulatory effect with things like mushrooms and aspirin.

**Caller (Blue Lake):** I've been told my whole life I am iron deficient. I've tried to correct it with molasses.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors for at least 100 years have been diagnosing iron deficiency in women. 100 years ago, they prescribed arsenic to treat it. Either arsenic or iron supplements stimulate the production of red blood cells because they create a local oxygen deficiency—stress—which increases formation. High estrogen always tends to cause a slight anemia appearance just by slowing the production of red cells.

**Caller (Blue Lake):** I also have high lead content.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Drinking milk, orange juice, and coffee will correct that over a period of weeks.

## Caller: Mushroom Preparation

**Caller (Sugar Cove):** Why boil mushrooms for an hour?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The hydrazines are heat sensitive. It is believed that the hydrazine compounds are the carcinogens. They evaporate and break down. Around an hour will drastically lower the concentration. It is a balance between the pro-carcinogenic hydrazines and the anti-cancer agents, such as the aromatase inhibitors.

## Caller: Amino Acids & Organ Meats

**Caller (Virginia):** What about taking ornithine at night to mop up excess ammonia for sleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It might help with the ammonia, but I would worry about the promotion of cell division if you used it chronically. It is one of the things that activates cell division.

**Caller (Virginia):** What about L-Threonine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think it is very safe to use individual amino acids. Glycine is the only one I know of that is safe by itself because it can be used as energy.

**Caller (Virginia):** Is Monolaurin safe for endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has a good effect killing fungi and bacteria, but it is an emulsifier. I suspect it could have an action like soap on the intestine and be irritating. Like MCT oil, a small amount can cause intestinal irritation and diarrhea.

**Caller (Virginia):** What about desiccated heart or brain from grass-fed animals?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain has a very high concentration of progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone. It is like taking a supplement of those steroids. I knew a Norwegian woman who said everyone in her coastal village ate fish head soup at least once a week, and everyone lived to be 95.

**Andrew Murray:** You have always advocated the whole animal—bone broths and gelatin—rather than just muscle meat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would worry about the dehydration process [in desiccated products]. The fatty acids, tryptophan, and cysteine are very sensitive to oxidation and can break down into toxins. You would have to be sure it was dehydrated under nitrogen. It seems like a risk. Eggs, for example, have lots of extremely beneficial substances and are always fresh.

## Catamenial Epilepsy

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to ask about catamenial epilepsy and how estrogens trigger epilepsy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Katharina Dalton was one of the early people working on that. She started treating PMS with progesterone in the 1940s. There isn't a terrible difference between catamenial epilepsy and PMS.

One of the first people I gave progesterone to was a schoolteacher with migraines. A doctor told her migraines were like epilepsy and prescribed an epileptic treatment. She said it made her too stupid to teach. She stopped it and had a seizure. She kept having seizures until she was in her early 50s.

I showed her how progesterone can be absorbed through the skin. She had stiff arthritic fingers; she dipped them in the solution. A few days later, she came back; her symptoms had disappeared, and she was bending her fingers. Within a few months, she went back to graduate school and got a master's degree in gerontology. The neurologist was right that epilepsy is closely related to PMS; she was simply having a premenstrual migraine that faded over into epilepsy.

## Conclusion

**Andrew Murray:** We will have to hold it there. Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com. It is full of fully referenced articles on thyroid, aspirin, progesterone, Alzheimer's, and more. Next month, we will finish the progesterone versus estrogen discussion. Thank you for listening.
