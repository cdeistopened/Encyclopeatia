## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Good evening. My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have never listened to our shows, we are both licensed medical herbalists. We were trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions, and we manufacture our own certified organic herbal extracts.

This month we are very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat back to the show. We will be exploring how medical radiation can have deleterious effects on our living biological systems and, if time allows, a discussion of food safety. I wanted to remind our listeners of the Hippocratic Oath, which doctors undertake when they begin their practice. First and foremost, it states: "First, do no harm."

Welcome, Dr. Raymond Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hello.

**Andrew Murray:** For listeners who may not have heard you before, could you briefly give an outline of your academic background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was a student of literature and linguistics for years before I decided to get a degree in biology. In 1968, I went to the University of Oregon intending to get a PhD concentrating in neurology or brain biology. Very quickly, I saw that the nerve and brain people were extremely dogmatic and not really interested in studying the way the organism works. I found that reproductive physiology in that university had a really scientific orientation, so I did my dissertation on the endocrine and metabolic changes in aging of the reproductive system.

## The Dangers of Medical Radiation

**Andrew Murray:** I know you have done a lot of work on thyroid hormone and progesterone. I wanted to ask you to expand on a topic many people suspect: the potential harm of X-rays. The medical establishment purports them to be very safe. Is there an upper limit to exposure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They don't keep a record of how much radiation they're giving patients. I've had many people who had obvious brain symptoms or spinal column symptoms of radiation poisoning. They asked the various doctors that had treated them what their exposure had been—for example, radiation for prostate cancer or fluoroscope visualization during heart surgery. None of the doctors had the vaguest idea how much radiation they had received, but it added up and caused classical degenerative symptoms.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't it true that there isn't really an organization that monitors the X-ray machines in hospitals regarding how much radiation each machine is emitting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that has improved. They are generally supposed to calibrate them once a year.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you describe the principle behind X-radiation and how it causes negative effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The harmful effect is essentially from the ionization of molecules in the body. There is a spectrum ranging from radio waves through infrared, ultraviolet, soft and hard X-rays, and gamma rays. They classify things from the hard ultraviolet category through X-rays and gamma rays as "ionizing radiation." However, there are molecules in the body that ionize spontaneously, so anything from the weakest energy can increase the degree of ionization in the body.

It is a very misleading idea that only the so-called ionizing radiation is harmful. It is the amount of ionization produced that causes the damage. The radiation has to interact and resonate with some atom or molecule in the tissues to cause harm. If it passes through without being absorbed, there is no particular harm done. But if it ends up in your tissue and doesn't come out the other side, that does the harm.

For example, red light can pass through your body harmlessly. Blue and ultraviolet light will give you a sunburn. With soft, lower-energy X-rays, you can get a sunburn on one side while barely exposing film on the other side of your body. They tend to use higher energy, hard X-rays so that you don't fry one side of your body to get a picture of something inside. But still, with a chest X-ray, the side facing the emitter is going to get a higher dose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So that shows something is getting stuck in the body; it's not going all the way through.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's the same principle as getting sunburned on the side facing the sun. If you are facing the X-ray emitter with the detector on your back, your breasts are going to be at greater risk than if you turned the other way. But since your heart and lungs are right in the middle, they get it either way.

## Sunlight vs. X-Rays vs. Cosmic Rays

**Andrew Murray:** How would you compare the sun's radiation to radiation from MRIs or X-rays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The atmosphere filters out the harder, higher-energy X-rays and ultraviolet C. The kind of ultraviolet that burns us is ultraviolet A and B. To some extent, blue light can cause a sunburn. The burning effect is very superficial; it goes just a few millimeters into your skin and is absorbed. However, a sunburn can poison you systemically. Even though it's absorbed at the surface, you can suffer general systemic sickness.

The things in your skin that absorb the radiation from ultraviolet are the colored vitamins—folic acid, vitamin B2, and carotene or vitamin A—and the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The PUFA spread the energy absorbed by these colored substances. The excited or oxidized fatty acids in your skin can travel and cause the release of inflammatory mediators all the way from your skin into your bloodstream and throughout your body.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about cosmic rays?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cosmic rays are particles moving at extremely high speed. They pass through our bodies constantly. Because these primary particles are traveling at such high speed, our molecules don't resonate with them. The electrons that are knocked loose usually go back to where they were and don't cause much damage.

However, if you put animals under about a half-inch of lead, these primary cosmic rays hit a nucleus in the lead instead of being shielded. They cause a fission reaction in the lead nucleus, creating an intense shower of secondary cosmic rays. If you are in a building with a very thick roof, especially with metal overhead, you get some of that same effect.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the secondary rays are traveling slower?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Essentially. They increase their ionization of the tissue as they slow down. It's analogous to skiing at high speed and falling. If you hit fluffy snow, you slow down gradually. If you hit dense snow, you come to a sudden, damaging stop. All the energy is absorbed by your tissue suddenly. That is what happens with these lower-energy particles.

If you eat an isotope which emits particles—such as those used to scan the thyroid or do PET scans—those are largely absorbed right in the local tissue. Those are extremely carcinogenic.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So not only are you exposed to the carcinogenic effect of the actual PET scan, but the substance you take to show up on the scan is also radioactive?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They often do it to find a tumor that concentrates the radioactive substance. But if you look at the whole body, the brightest spots are usually the brain, the kidneys, and the thyroid gland. They don't mention that those are highly metabolic areas that concentrate the radioactive substance.

## The Bystander Effect and Systemic Damage

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Japan, blood tests show that people exposed to the atomic bomb 60 years earlier still have a lingering inflammatory reaction in which their blood is still emitting excited photons.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** They still basically have radioactive particles inside their body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not exactly radioactive, but it started a process, sort of like rancidity in oil. If you start an inflammatory reaction with radiation and don't stop it, it can continue for the rest of your life.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When doctors say a dental X-ray is equivalent to spending all day in the sun, how untrue is that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Totally untrue. An ordinary sunburn is actually slightly good for you, probably by making vitamin D. There is no good produced by the type of radiation from an X-ray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about people working in high-rise buildings?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Above the 25th parallel of latitude, the cosmic rays are intense enough that it probably increases your cancer risk.

They used to believe it was only the direct action of radiation on genetic material that caused cancer. But if you irradiate cells in a dish to cause mutations, and then add fresh, unexposed cells to that dish, the fresh cells will begin to mutate. It is called the "bystander effect." The damaged cells send a signal to the new cells in their environment that causes the same kind of damage, exactly as if they had been irradiated.

**Andrew Murray:** Is this trait heritable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It is undoubtedly a mixture of excitation and chemical signaling. Dentists will often put a lead apron over a pregnant woman and say, "We're just going to X-ray your head so the baby isn't affected." But a study in Seattle looked at pregnant women who had dental X-rays. When their babies were born, they were underdeveloped and smaller, showing that something happened systemically to the mother's physiology that affected the fetus.

Animal experiments in the 1950s established that X-rays act like estrogen. It will even cause rodents to go into heat. For years, people thought it excited the pituitary, but experiments showed that if they just X-rayed the animal's foot, the whole physiology would behave as if they had been given estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the lead shield doesn't fully protect the fetus because the mouth sends estrogen-like signals through the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly.

## Cell Phones and Microwaves

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller on the line.

**Caller:** Hi, I had a question regarding microwave radiation related to telephones and cell phones. Is that damaging?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 35 years ago, there were laboratories working with that frequency of energy, and there were clusters of brain cancers on the staff. Within a year or two, several people would develop brain cancer working around those high-intensity fields. In that context, the studies suggesting cell phones cause brain tumors are very believable.

**Andrew Murray:** How about acoustic neuromas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Whatever is close to a field is going to be affected. Because of industrial commitments to exposing the population to high energy—radar, microwaves, etc.—government and industry have put pressure on researchers not to see any harm. But from the 1950s on, researchers showed that nerves are seriously disturbed even by very low levels of microwave and radio frequency.

## Dental X-Rays vs. Ultrasound

**Caller:** I need dental work, and I realize the dentist is going to do a huge X-ray. Is it better to let my teeth rot rather than have a dental X-ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I know dentists in Mexico who have gone against the pressure to do X-rays for everything. I know endodontists who reliably do root canals without X-rays. It can be done if the doctor is skilled enough and not primarily interested in getting the patient in and out quickly. Ultrasound imagery has been proven to work beautifully for teeth—you can see fine detail—but dentists are invested in X-ray technology.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So MRI and ultrasound are radiation-free diagnostic techniques?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The kind of radiation they use is less harmful than gamma rays.

## Airport Security and Cumulative Exposure

**Caller:** Anyone who flies gets exposed to scattering from the X-raying of luggage. What kind of exposure are they getting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I haven't seen the exposure doses for those machines, but the history of X-ray technologists is not encouraging. Dentists always assured patients the stuff was harmless, but there was an epidemic of dentists losing their index fingers to cancer. Now they make the patient hold the X-ray film.

**Caller:** I had a lot of radiation as a child—liquid isotopes and mammograms as a teenager. What can we do to counteract the cumulative effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you know you are going to be exposed, or to repair damage, you can protect yourself by making sure your thyroid function is good.

**Protective substances include:**
*   **Magnesium:** The single most protective substance against radiation damage. It helps heal genetic breaks; DNA repair enzymes are activated by magnesium.
*   **Vitamin E and Vitamin A:** Antioxidants are protective.
*   **Progesterone and Pregnenolone:** Stabilizing hormones that reduce inflammation.
*   **Coffee:** Caffeine itself has an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effect. Coffee is also high in magnesium and B vitamins.
*   **Niacinamide:** Protects against DNA injury.

**Caller:** What about full-body CAT scans?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A CAT scan typically gives you about 200 times the radiation dose that a single picture does. It is big business, but bad business. John Gofman discussed this extensively in his work.

**Caller:** I'm a midwife. I noticed that around a microwave tower in the countryside, I would see three- and four-eared rabbits.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They have known for a long time that telephone or power line workers—men—have mostly female offspring, and birds that live near power lines have nearly all female offspring. It is reproductive disruption.

## Seaweed and Iodine

**Caller:** I wanted to add seaweed to the list. It is a detoxer of heavy metals and radioactivity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Seaweed is even better than potassium iodide tablets, but it only protects you against **radioactive iodine**. This is the first and worst radiation injury from a nuclear leak, like Three Mile Island. However, it wouldn't help with radiation from a CAT scan or X-ray. Also, iodine is risky to use chronically; getting just two or three times the minimum requirement can increase the risk of goiter, thyroiditis, and thyroid cancer over a long period.

## Alternatives and Future Outlook

**Andrew Murray:** What are the upcoming techniques that are safer for visualizing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For mammograms, there is now good evidence that MRI and ultrasound will give even better information than X-rays. With an X-ray, you can't tell what is a tumor and what isn't. With an MRI, you can detect the type of chemicals and physiology in the soft tissue.

**Andrew Murray:** If someone is in a traffic accident and may have broken bones, is an X-ray justified?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Except for broken bones, or locating a bone splinter in the brain or lung, X-rays are limited. You can't really see much about the soft tissue.

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think will be the long-term effects of our current exposure levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is already showing up. I am getting a huge number of emails from young women, from teens into their 40s, who have a problem with fat around their waist. Obesity is epidemic, and degenerative diseases, allergies, and asthma are increasing tremendously.

**Andrew Murray:** Can you explain the link between allergies, obesity, and inflammation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things that cause obesity also cause inflammation. Asthma is an inflammatory disease. The cytokines that regulate metabolism trigger cortisone production once you start down the inflammatory pathway. Cortisone directs fat to your face, abdomen, and shoulders. Chronic overproduction of cortisone causes degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis, obesity, and heart disease.

## Lupus and Autoimmune Disease

**Caller:** Has there been an increase in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) due to cumulative radiation? And is there a way to treat lupus successfully?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is my impression regarding the increase, though I don't have the figures. Regarding treatment, I have seen lupus patients over the last 30 years recover completely, or at least not die of kidney failure, by using **thyroid, progesterone, and avoiding polyunsaturated fat (PUFA)**.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you very much for joining us again, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
