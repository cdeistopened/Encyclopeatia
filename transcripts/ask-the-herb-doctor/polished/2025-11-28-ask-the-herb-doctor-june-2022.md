## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Well, good evening and welcome to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. This is June 17th, 2022. My name's Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to the show. At 7:30, we'll open the lines up to invite callers in with questions related to this month's topic, which is going to be around food, the corporation's control of food, and some ongoing numbers and statistics from the COVID fallout. Then we're going to get into some parts of the political discourse and involvement of big companies in the Ukraine and fertilizer production. Hopefully, we're going to get to the topic of the baby milk shortage, follow that up with some artificial meat topics, and as always, have the great pleasure of having Dr. Peat's superb overview of a lot of things.

I guess it's part of his age that enables him to encompass at least 40 or 50 years of time spent studying the subjects, and another three decades on top of that of living to see the events unfolding that have done so. He's got a pretty good, rounded view of many different subjects, and alternative medicine is one of them. He's been spending a large part of his life and his career looking at the research, which is always the most interesting part of any of this factual information. It's not just opinion. So once again, very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us on the show. Dr. Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. Well, if you don't mind, for the next five minutes or so, I just wanted to run an introduction to some of the questions that I'll be asking you. But just to wrap up last month's discourse, we talked about genetic modification and corporations with patent rights on intellectual property. Especially Monsanto with their genetically engineered seeds, and the quote-unquote moratorium that was on natural products certainly seems to have been put to one side now, where naturally occurring products like corn, wheat, and potatoes have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified versions. I think this also runs into vaccine technology and the emerging infections that we've gone through since the mid-1990s up until now, with COVID obviously being the major part of our prior two-year discourse.

I also wanted to remind people that the lawyer Reiner Fuellmich has a huge amount of data on his website, which I would encourage everyone to look at as a superb, chronologically documented series of allegations. He's charging crimes against humanity for many organizations, institutions, and governments.

Also mentioned last month that the United Nations has changed the terminology from "technocracy" to "green economy" and "sustainable development," and how that impacts us all very negatively because it sounds so innocuous and harmless. Sustainable development—who doesn't want sustainability? We all do. I want local markets, I want people growing food locally. I don't want huge corporations shipping food from one side of the world to the other and displacing rural farmers. We want sustainable development. But the words "sustainable development" have been couched in such a way as to embrace this technocracy, which we exposed last month as really beginning from about the 1920s. Dr. Peat certainly weighed in on what he understands of technocracy, having lived through it, and obviously the Rockefeller Foundation and all the other power players that are forming the heads of government institutions and global organizations, from the Codex Alimentarius to the Great Reset.

## Post-Pandemic Mortality Rates in Working-Age People

**Andrew Murray:** Anyway, that was just an overview of last month. I wanted to open up this month with something that caught my eye. The fifth-largest life insurance company in the US has just paid out 163% more for deaths of working people—folks from 18 to 64, not old people. The company cites "non-pandemic-related morbidity" and "unusual claims adjustments" as the explanation of losses from group life insurance businesses. The stock is falling and the CEO has been replaced.

The head of an Indianapolis-based insurance company, OneAmerica, said the death rate is up a stunning 40% from pre-pandemic levels among working-age people. Five months after the CEO of OneAmerica broke this story, a new report is out that a much larger life insurance company, Lincoln National, reported a 163% increase in death benefits paid out under its group life insurance policies in 2021.

To quote the OneAmerica CEO, Scott Davison, he stated, "We are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business, not just at OneAmerica... it's consistent across every player in the business." OneAmerica is a $100 billion insurance company. Davison said the increase in death represents huge numbers, and that it's not elderly people who are dying, but primarily working-age people, 18 through 64. He said, "What we saw just in third quarter, we're seeing it continue into fourth quarter, and that is that death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic. Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three-sigma or a one-in-200-year catastrophe would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic. So 40% is just unheard of."

Now, what is driving this unprecedented surge in all-cause mortality? It was not only deaths of working-age people that shot up to unheard-of levels in 2021, but also short- and long-term disability claims. If this holds true, then the genetic vaccines so aggressively promoted have failed, and the clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with life-saving drugs has contributed to a massive, avoidable loss of life. At worst, this report implies that the federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appears to be a true crime against humanity: a massive loss of life in workers that have been forced to accept a toxic vaccine at a higher frequency relative to the general population.

Furthermore, we've also been living through the most massive, globally coordinated propaganda and censorship campaign in the history of the human race. All major mass media and social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of the genetic vaccines and/or alternative early treatments.

So, Dr. Peat, with that introduction—I'm sure it's not news to you, I know you've been tirelessly talking about this since the very beginning of 2020—what are your interpretations of this insurance company's disclosure of these facts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several other companies since then have reported very similar increased mortality, around 40%, in the working-age group. Insurance companies generally have extremely accurate statistics, better than governments as a rule, because their income depends on exactness. So it's really the scientific basis for saying that it wasn't the virus that's responsible, but the vaccination. That's when the 40% rise began. And it fits what the skeptical virologists have been claiming: that the mortality is going to be far, far worse from the vaccine than from whatever occurred from the virus.

**Andrew Murray:** I think that was the point that was made: it was all-cause mortality in young people, and a lot of it was to do with damage and disability. So whether the death may have been caused by the vaccine or not, the amount of money paid out due to the disabilities that were claimed is a pretty stunning part of the numbers. I think we've mentioned in the past that when we're describing things like mortality and altitude, it was the very insurance companies that let that information out, which supported the claim that lower premiums were imposed on people at higher altitude because they were not as likely as people at sea level to die.

## The Origins of the Omicron Variant

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so that's the first thing, just seeing some glaring headlines about the deaths and insurance companies making payouts and how this is now just part of the fallout of COVID. Supposedly now what we're seeing is the actuality of it all with Omicron. I don't know if you feel that Omicron is a naturally produced variant or indeed any other type of it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has the most bizarre gene sequences of all of the other variants. Starting with the Wuhan virus, the other variants show a series of mutations building on each other. So the most recent, until Omicron, showed exactly the same series of mutations incorporated. It was definitely that virus improving its survivability by mutating. But the Omicron is unique. It didn't show any mutations after Wuhan. While the Wuhan virus was going through all of these changes, nothing was happening at all to the Omicron. Suddenly when it pops up, it is essentially the pristine Wuhan virus with a new series built right on the original virus, none of the history of natural mutation—as if it was being held aside and going through a different series of mutations, as if it wasn't in the world at all for these intervening years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So are you saying that basically the original COVID went through mutations and you can track that, and then all of a sudden Omicron was like the original with just some alterations to it, so it looked like it had been lab-produced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and those mutations made it much less harmful. So if someone was preparing a product to end the pandemic by turning it off with a fairly harmless virus...

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So do you think that if people have Omicron and they've developed antibodies to that and caught that naturally, even though it's not a naturally mutated virus, then will they be better able to fight the original Delta or those other variants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it won't especially affect them. If it's the dominant virus and it's very harmless, then the other one just isn't going to be around to cause trouble.

## Corporate Takeover of Ukrainian Agriculture

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to *Ask Your Herb Doctor*. From 7:30 to the end of the show, callers are invited to call in with any questions either related to this month's discussion or any other questions they'd like to pose to Dr. Peat about health-related or alternative medicine. The number is 707-923-3911.

Okay, so moving on to the major content of this next 45 minutes. I read a 2014 article from the Oakland Institute. Eight years later, what we're seeing now in Ukraine and Russia is really a question that's embroiled in health, government control, and takeovers. People have certainly heard a lot about Roundup and Monsanto and GMOs.

So the Oakland Institute published a 2014 paper outlining what was being described then as a global corporate takeover of agricultural land in the Ukraine. Ukraine has been hailed as the breadbasket of Europe with a staggering 32 million-plus hectares of incredibly fertile black arable soil. For those of you who are gardeners or farmers, you're well aware of what this means to crops: lush, rich, fertile growth with excellent crop yields and quality harvests. If you too are Monsanto, one of the biggest agribusinesses on the planet, or one of a handful of other players buying into this hugely profitable location, rights to ownership are extremely lucrative. And corruption, as always, exists at the highest level for the highest returns.

Naturally, Ukraine's agricultural land was under a moratorium that banned its sale through January 1, 2016. When Ukraine separated from the Soviet Union in 1990, collectivized communal farms were disbanded and land was distributed in parcels of approximately four hectares each to people living on the farms. In 2001, Ukraine passed its Land Code legislation that gave people functional titles to land. Since then, there's been a moratorium on the sale of land.

The moratorium on land sales applies only to agricultural land, making it both legal and affordable for investors to build and operate a 100% foreign-owned processing facility on its own industrial land while leasing fields from agricultural landowners. A second way that investors could circumvent the land moratorium was by buying shares of large existing Ukrainian agribusinesses. The system of land distribution in the 1990s often led to the concentration of land in the hands of a few elites. Alongside land opportunities, the development, production, and use of agricultural inputs like seeds, agrochemicals, and fertilizers have attracted investment by agribusiness giants Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, and others. So I was going to ask you, Dr. Peat, you had lots of other information to tie this in.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone has heard about the International Monetary Fund offering the Ukraine a $40 billion loan if they would stop the moratorium, specifically so Monsanto and the other giant corporations could concentrate ownership on a big corporate scale. There was a coup to make that happen because the elected presidency had rejected the IMF fund. The IMF, working with the World Bank and all of the other so-called Western authorities, wanted to reverse that and stop the moratorium, so they supported the coup. And the coup was very clear that they were going to adapt laws that would let Monsanto take over. When the coup happened, in fact, that did take place. They had to get rid of the legally elected president and establish the Zelensky government supporting the Monsanto privatization system.

**Andrew Murray:** So how do you see Russia's involvement? Because this seems to be a two-sided story.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, part of the Monsanto thing is that they want to use chemicals like Roundup to make the profitability of certain giant land corporations favorable to them. The European Union had opposed the United States' policy of supporting Monsanto and genetic modification. So there was a conflict. Several Western European countries went along with wanting to outlaw GMOs.

It turned out that historically, Russia had been passing laws to promote organic farming and to outlaw GMOs. They were aiming for 100% freedom from GMOs and, naturally, from Monsanto. That really was the polarization for the coup and for the International Monetary Fund loan. When the elected president made a deal with Russia for a loan that would bypass the International Monetary Fund, that was the actual moment when the coup took place and got him out of power in Ukraine.

## Russia's Stance on GMOs and Organic Farming

**Andrew Murray:** I read a couple of years ago, and you can back me up on this, that Vladimir Putin was boasting that he was going to make Russia one of, if not the biggest, organic food producers in the world.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah, that's what one of his goals was. But I thought GMOs are still banned in Europe.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, I think they are in England. I'm pretty sure England had banned GMOs.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** No, I thought in England they're not banned because they're not part of the EU. So the EU has banned GMOs, is that your understanding, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are wobbling on the issue. There is still opposition to it, but now the war for Monsanto has affected the West. They aren't pushing so hard to oppose the GMOs.

## The Politically Motivated Food and Fertilizer Shortage

**Andrew Murray:** I wonder how the whole fertilizer shortage plays into it. Apparently, Ukraine is a big exporter or manufacturer of fertilizer. I wonder how that plays into it, along with the agriculturally rich diversity that is possible there in Ukraine, and how this quote-unquote food shortage they're talking about now... Before we get into the subject of baby milk, the food shortage issue, I wonder how politically motivated this is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, you can see many specific things in which it's been just openly promoted. For example, Union Pacific Railroad announced that they just weren't going to ship all of the fertilizer that the farmers needed. That preceded by several weeks the announcement that they were not going to allow the shipment and sale of urea, which is used in the diesel motors of trucks. By restricting the availability of this urea fuel modifier, they can turn off truck delivery too. But as a railroad, they simply said they're not going to ship all of the fertilizer that's ordered.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And why did they say that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one knows, but it seems to be that they are controlled by the giant fund BlackRock, and that is also just openly intending to turn off the food economy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they want to create a shortage for some monetary gain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yes. If you look at the pattern over the last several years, just weeks before the pandemic, Klaus Schwab was saying, "Well, we've done our best to use the carbon dioxide climate change mistaken science to fulfill our purpose of controlling the overall production. But now, luckily, we've got something much, much better, that in just a period of two or three years we'll be able to turn off the national and world production of everything—the ordinary daily economy, including food and all of the necessaries of life."

**Andrew Murray:** You can't make this stuff up. This reminds me of the whole discourse that I first heard with Rima Laibow back in 2006, I think it was, about Codex Alimentarius and how the entire thing is essentially a playbook from the end of the war, with the emergence of technocracy through to global governments and one-world currency. It's all been documented. The way she was talking back in 2006, it blew me away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I started looking into it, and the more you look at it, the more connections you see.

So when we get things like the war in Ukraine and we hear, well, actually, maybe Russia was siding on the side of organic production... obviously there's a problem with people dying. Don't get me wrong, I'm not condoning war. But the reasons by which this happened are serious government evil prospects and control and manipulation of the populations of various countries to produce the narrative they want. That's exactly what social media has sought to bring about.

It might sound a little scary to people that are just listening to it, but there's a lot more to it. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a huge amount we can do about it except peacefully protest. That's the saddest part of what I've witnessed going through these last two years. There's such a polarization, such a control of information on the one hand, that people are not getting the full information. I just heard today that Simone Gold of the American Frontline Doctors, who were organizing patient consultations and alternatives to COVID treatments, has just been imprisoned for two months. This was all part and parcel of her 2020 appearance at the state Capitol and her peaceful protest. The whole thing about free speech is like, if we're not careful, folks, it's gone. Getting ratted out by your neighbor is in, and the Soviet-style era of people watching people and people policing each other is kind of a scary reality which I think has crept in so pervasively with this COVID pandemic.

## The Baby Formula Crisis

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so getting to the baby milk crisis. I wonder what your opinion of this is, because I know you've definitely got lots to say about soy and PUFA and all of these things. From a corporate perspective of making money, of mothers in Africa... I'm not saying that women that have children that don't produce enough milk shouldn't be helped, of course not. But there are other alternatives to formula. So what do you think about this baby formula crisis? It may not be a bad thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The soy formula had its own terrible side effects. In immature animals, the estrogenic factors associated with the proteins used in making the milk substitute cause deformed genitals in the developing young and later promote tumors of various sorts. So the plant-based milk formulas were a terrible problem in themselves.

And then Nestlé's innovations, basically selling dehydrated cow milk as a basis for people around the world to mix up at home, despite the fact that clean water to mix it with is absent in so many of the poor countries. So they were doing something very counter-social and dangerous. But even in the US, where people couldn't make a formula themselves, if they really couldn't produce milk, they could simply make a formula based on cow milk. When it isn't dehydrated, the reaction on the immune system is less harmful.

To take a non-human milk and introduce it right at the very beginning will cause some antigenic differences, but at least if it's made from fresh cow milk, that's a lot safer than dehydrated. Every time you dehydrate a living substance, you kill it and oxidize some of the proteins, amino acids, and especially the fatty acids. The cholesterol is oxidized. That's really only one of the fairly trivial problems of dehydrated milk—that the cholesterol is damaged and made toxic. But many, many other components of the milk are susceptible to oxidative damage.

There is a whole anti-science that has grown up to defend the industry's use not only of dehydrated milk, but of the added polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is really a separate issue. They argue that human milk contained more PUFA than cow milk, so that has been a separate industry to say that the baby must be given a supplement of n-3 fatty acids, because they say almost all babies at birth have evidence of a deficiency of n-3 fatty acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's because the placenta has filtered it out.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly. It is recognized as something to be excluded during pregnancy, but they reverse that and say you need to supplement everyone because everyone is deficient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the body naturally tries to keep it away from the baby, you're deficient. The rationale is insane.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And they extend that to say that the aged brain contains increased amounts of n-3 PUFA. So they are wanting to say that because you find it in the old brain, that means it should be there. But meanwhile, the old brain has deteriorated in proportion to the reduction of mitochondrial energy production, and that reduction corresponds to the increased presence of n-3 PUFA in the brain. So at every point, they've twisted the science. One of the ways they twist it is with certain tests of retinal responsiveness to electrical stimulation. They say if you increase that with your added PUFA, you're going to show that that addition makes the eye develop faster and the brain develop its mental ability sooner. But that is all just fantasy speculation.

## Caller: Questions on Menopause Symptoms

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, we got a call that came in. Apparently, the caller wanted to ask a question off the air. The lines are open, 707-923-3911. Okay, what was the question that was being asked?

**Call Screener:** So the caller wanted to know if you could talk about some good things for menopause, such as she's having brain fog and nausea.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, ginger is always great for nausea.

**Andrew Murray:** Brain fog. Okay, so good nootropics. I don't know how supportive you are of nootropics outside of using anti-stress substances like pregnenolone for decreasing cortisol and for decreasing inflammation. But what would your response to that be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, all of those things. Coffee, for example, aspirin—things that promote mitochondrial oxidative use.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And herbal support would be Vitex, chaste berry, and black cohosh. Those are very effective at helping mitigate menopausal symptoms.

## Synthetic Breast Milk and Artificial Meat

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask a question about the milk. So all baby formula is dehydrated milk or dehydrated... let's just say it's all dehydrated. So when you say make a formula out of milk, would you suggest adding anything to fresh cow milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, you can adjust the amount of fat and water if it makes it more palatable to the baby, but just as is, it'll work.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And so what about this talk in the news of a synthetic breast milk? What do you think of that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, it definitely works.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Do you think that would be preferable to cow's milk for babies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Well, assuming that the mother is eating properly, because human milk reflects the human diet. Because we don't have a rumen, the cow can eat grass and weeds and quite a lot of polyunsaturated fats and detoxifies them in the rumen. So as a rule, you can say that if the woman is eating well, then her milk is going to be better than cow's milk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. So the question I was asking is, of course, we all know that mama's milk, breast milk, is preferable for a baby with a healthy diet. But I've read about them making breast milk in a laboratory, trying to synthesize breast milk in a lab. I was wondering what your thoughts were on that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, probably not good. It might have certain similarities to breast milk, but it's definitely going to be a synthetic, chemical material.

**Andrew Murray:** What about the subject of artificial meat? Again, between milk and meat and canceling out substances like sugar, the industry and whoever's behind it is seeking, I think, to separate people from their natural world. I'm not saying everyone needs to drink milk, but I am saying that milk is an extremely good food, and I think there's so much evidence to support its use that the whole demonization of it is really the same kind of skewing of information that you've given previous examples of.

## The Dangers of High Protein Diets in Older Adults

**Andrew Murray:** You've mentioned recently about protein intake for older people necessarily needing to be decreased, and that that's not a bad thing. You've never been big on muscle meat per se; you've always encouraged people to use the whole animal, getting the gelatin from making a broth, for example, of chicken or knuckle bones or lamb shank.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. For many years, people have been aware that with aging, the metabolic rate slows down. Broda Barnes was thinking about that and the importance of the metabolic rate. He had been using a supplement of, I think, two grains of Armour Thyroid. He decided to go on a high-protein diet when he was around 60, I think, and found that he had to double his dose of thyroid hormone to maintain his functioning, showing that for an older person, what seems to be a good level of protein can actually be very powerfully suppressive to your thyroid function.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so we've talked about things like soy protein in the past being used as a meat alternative. We know that's definitely not a beneficial substance in terms of it raising estrogen in men and women and being relatively inflammatory in its own right. I think it's just part and parcel of our human nature, and for me, it's kind of speaking to the "buyer beware" mentality that I think everyone needs to try and hang onto. Because just like social media and technology, we're cajoled and lured into this seemingly fuzzy world of comfortable technology, and we're really just sucking down so much poison. It's like being on drugs that are completely separating you from reality in terms of what's actually going on around you, that you don't say anything. You're just cajoled and fuzzily think, "Oh, it's okay if the government knows what they're doing. This COVID vaccine's a good thing. It saves lives. What are you talking about? You're the crazy one." I'll bring that subject back out in a moment here, but we do have another caller on the air.

## Caller: The Importance of Saving Seeds

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take this next call. Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

**Caller:** I'm from the Arcata area. I just wanted to make a comment, kind of looking at the general trend of things in this country where big corporations want to control everything, or at least the bulk of the economy. It had to do with seeds. You guys were talking about food and growing organic vegetables and stuff like that. I was surprised, talking to one of the vendors at the farmer's market, that she had to buy seeds. I don't know if it's some kind of license type of thing.

But just looking at the trend of how things are evolving, I would expect that over time the seed supply is going to be completely controlled or mostly controlled by big companies. It would behoove people to learn how to make their own seed, grow their own seed, save seed, and try to keep it from being contaminated with genes that are going to be inserted to either make it so you could only grow seed and it won't reproduce or what have you. So I guess that was my comment. Just moving forward, that's a good thing for people to try to explore. Thank you for your show.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, you're welcome.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you for your call.

## Resisting Dehumanization and Technocracy

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. Yeah, and I want to follow up on that caller. This really applies to people that are fortunate enough to have a garden. I'm not talking about acres of land, but just people that have a small garden to grow vegetables in. Because it's all about the cities and it's all about the mass media control they have over populations. When you're in the cities and under their domain and you don't have a garden and you don't have a connection to the natural world, that's when all of this is breaking down.

I think so many people, unfortunately, are just sucking it down. I find it hard to believe in some ways that they're pulling it off, but I think what's happening really is a concerted and orchestrated attempt—not even an attempt, I think they're doing it. It's an orchestrated play and we're going through the motions. But I never give up, and I would encourage everybody listening never to give up. As far as I'm concerned, they're never going to win. You just have to keep resisting to the very end, because the end is not the end.

## A Hopeful Outlook for the Future

**Andrew Murray:** So, yeah, Dr. Peat, you've been around quite a while now and you've seen governments come and go and heads of state come and go. You've seen lots of headlines and politics. I'll just ask you in these last few closing moments about your impression.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah. Is there any hope for the world?

**Andrew Murray:** What do you think about it? I know we're still alive and we're still trying to do the right thing, but where are you with all of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm still hopeful. Like Reiner Fuellmich said, we have to do everything legal and possible to try to prosecute these people, but at some point, he's going to count on some kind of a cosmic bailout for us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wait, Reiner is counting on a cosmic bailout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I forgot his exact phrase, but he said he couldn't explain it rationally, but he had this confidence that the universe wasn't going to let that turn out the way the World Economic Forum hopes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, that's hopeful.

**Andrew Murray:** There's hope then. Well, good. I appreciate your time joining us on the show. I'm only sad that we didn't have more callers.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** It's a busy weekend. People have rodeo and the summer arts fair.

**Andrew Murray:** That's local. I can only hope that people are listening and not calling in. But like I always say, the archive is there for people to listen to in the future, and the future will vindicate what you've said for a long time. So thanks so much again, Dr. Peat, for joining us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Okay, thank you and good night.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so I just wanted to finish off by saying that this connection is undoubtable between technocracy and dehumanization through lockdowns and social isolation. With government coercive measures and Soviet-era style social control where individuals are set against individuals, similar also to the Brownshirts of Nazi Germany, the Orwellian reality we are now in must be resisted vehemently through peaceful protests and political involvement on the state and local level. It's the reason we need another Nuremberg, with charges of international war crimes against humanity where the guilty are charged, and why Reiner Fuellmich's group in Germany is at this very moment pressing these charges. So the thing is ongoing. I like to think that there is real justice and that we're not just going to be sucked into the matrix.

Hello?

**Caller 2:** Hello?

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, go ahead. We've got three minutes until the top of the hour.

**Caller 2:** Okay, a couple of things.

**Andrew Murray:** I don't even think we've got time. We've got three minutes. It's not going to happen. I'm so sorry. Okay, we better call this it because I will run over.

**Caller 2:** So basically, I want to know... they say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and you seem to think that getting some kind of treatment is better than getting a vaccine to prevent the COVID. I would rather not get it than have to get it and be treated for it. So I'd like an answer to that question. And also, basically, why do you think that the vaccine is worse for you than the COVID itself?

**Andrew Murray:** The information is out there for anybody who wants to search for it. It's not something you're going to see on your Facebook group or on your YouTube channel or Google.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Or the fact-checkers that work for Google.

**Andrew Murray:** And it is two minutes to the top of the hour, so I need to give credit to Dr. Peat and his website and his information. So I appreciate your call but don't have time to answer it. I'm sorry.

For those of you who've listened to the show, they run every third Friday of the month. We'll be back in July. We run a business called Western Botanical Medicine, and Dr. Raymond Peat's website is raypeat.com—R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com. He has got plenty of scientific, referenced articles that are not his opinion but are pulled from current or past medical journals and medical research trials. Again, it may not be something that you'll find on your Facebook group or if you just Google it. Up until this point, you're probably not going to find it, and some of it's going to be censored. And we're probably moving into a more censored environment as we go on, folks. So people just watch out. Anyway, without being alarmist about it, my name is Andrew Murray, and we'll talk to you again in July.
