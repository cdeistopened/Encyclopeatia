## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's August 19th, 2022 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who have just tuned in, it's a once-a-month radio show, the third Friday of each month from 7:00 till 8:00 PM. We are joined by the expert scientific viewpoint—not opinion, but scientific viewpoint—of Dr. Raymond Peat. I appreciate all those people that do tune into the show either live or who listen to the archives.

I am very pleased to welcome Dr. Peat to the show. I think he has somewhat recovered from some voice hoarseness due to the wildfires up in Oregon. How are you doing, Dr. Peat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I have a tummy cold. I probably should clarify what I mean by "scientific viewpoint." I'm not like Fauci; I don't have *the* scientific viewpoint. I think of the scientific viewpoint as a critical one—always thinking about the evidence and what you're really implying. So it's a matter of criticism and thinking.

**Andrew Murray:** You're always able to back up what you say with articles, reference journals, or other bona fide published information. Just in case anybody listening doesn't know you, could you give an outline of your academic and professional background before we start the show?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied the humanities first through a master's degree, and then went back in 1968 to the University of Oregon for a PhD in biology. Basically physiological chemistry, specifically the metabolic and physiological changes that happen in the reproductive system in aging. There is a chapter of that dissertation where I concentrated on what at that time was still sometimes called metaplasm, or lipofuscin, as a basic cause of aging.

## The Myth of Essential Fatty Acids

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to expand on your work and discourse on lipofuscin. We've mentioned it in the past in relation to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Public awareness has exploded in the last 18 months with publications coming out saying that they are not safe, that they are dangerous, and that the thinking of the last three decades was erroneous and has resulted in pathology—not just obesity and diabetes, but other degenerative conditions.

Can I start by going over some basics regarding these so-called "essential fatty acids"? If you look online, it seems to imply that they are only available from the diet. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, some very simple experiments make that really clear. But that amount of clarity in 80 years has hardly penetrated the beliefs about the facts because industry has found a motive in claiming that they are essential. The evidence for them being essential is of an extremely vague, inferential type.

The evidence against it is clear. For example, you can grow human cells in culture. If you're growing huge masses of cells, you know exactly what they're being fed. You can feed them on a diet absolutely excluding fatty acids, especially the unsaturated fatty acids. They multiply enormously on a diet of no environmental unsaturated fats. Obviously, any unsaturated fat that they contain is something that they have made themselves.

The basic recognized evidence that we aren't getting environmental linoleic or arachidonic acid—and are becoming deficient in these so-called essential fats—is two findings: that we are making something called Mead acid (an omega-9 series of polyunsaturated fats) and having a long saturated tail. This is just the opposite of fish oil. The n-3 (omega-3) has unsaturated groups within three carbons of the tip. The type we make ourselves, the Mead acids, are saturated fats extending down to within only nine carbons at the end. That makes them relatively resistant to external contact with oxygen.

**Andrew Murray:** That is important—the erroneous doctrine of them being essential and the fact that they are able to be manufactured. Haven't you said in the past that the placenta doesn't allow these fats to cross?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's a very good filter. Even when the mother is eating fish, grains, and unsaturated fats, the general recognition is that at birth, babies almost always demonstrate making some of the anti-inflammatory natural Mead acid. This shows that they were assimilating very little of the PUFA from the environment.

Defining the newborn baby as almost always "essential fatty acid deficient," the formula companies argued that they need to add fish oil extract to baby formula to make up for the fact that the newborn brain shows evidence of deficiency of exactly those fats. So they do add it to baby formula. Within a few days of reaching the grocery store, these fats are degrading, oxidizing, and becoming toxic. After about a month in the store, they degrade even more. The evidence is that what you're doing is feeding your baby rancid fish oil products which are toxic in many ways.

**Andrew Murray:** Haven't they done experiments to support the fact that babies fed on these formulas—because of the EPA and other fatty acids—show decreased cognition and awareness?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Those studies were done over the last 70 or 80 years in rats, dogs, and other animals. They showed that in proportion to the amount of PUFA in the diet, their brains are reduced in size and in learning ability after they're born. The deficient animals—without the PUFA in their brains—have bigger brains, are higher metabolizers all over, and learn much faster. In the 70s, some studies said the average rodent deficient in PUFA had something like a 140 IQ compared to his EPA-drugged siblings.

If you look at the aging brain right from birth, in all the animals that have been studied, the amount of PUFA in the brain steadily increases from the so-called deficient state at birth up until a heavy overload state in old age and dementia. There is a steady increase in PUFA concentration interfering with cholesterol synthesis. As the PUFA content of tissue increases, the heat production and metabolic energy of the whole animal decreases in proportion. The baby has extremely high overall oxygen consumption and metabolic rate, supporting that fantastic rate of learning that is normal for a newborn.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** An interesting side note: I'm not someone who suffered from heartburn, but when I was pregnant all three times, if I ate any PUFA-rich animal fat—like duck fat, chicken fat, or pork fat—I would get heartburn. Even just the tiniest bit. I was avoiding vegetable oils, but that was the only time I would get heartburn. It was very easy for me to see why I shouldn't be eating any kind of PUFA fats when I was pregnant.

## PUFA Oxidation and Body Temperature

**Andrew Murray:** The essential fatty acid myth has been destroyed. The fish oil industry is a multi-billion dollar conglomerate pushing this stuff, and academia pumps out supporting evidence showing anti-inflammatory effects. But the baby in the mother's womb selectively blocks the transport of these products.

Dr. Peat, the fact that these n-3 and n-6 fats are not essential, but are found in many different foods... I know you've always supported a saturated fat diet. But regarding the liquid oils we've been subjected to for 30 or 40 years—canola, corn, fish oil—do you think they should be consumed at all?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think they should be avoided as far as possible.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you outline your understanding of the process by which things like metal ions and stressors exert their effect on these n-3 and n-6 oils in the presence of our body temperature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nuts and seeds that produce the oils—and the snakes, frogs, and fish that use them habitually—do so without any special problem. Those oils are appropriate for manufacturing their own energy stores because they live at a fairly low temperature. Animal fats at room temperature tend to solidify; a snake with solidified fat just doesn't work very well. If you're going to have flexible, active tissues, you need to have fats that are liquid at body temperature.

These fats are appropriate for cold animals. If you put these fats into a very hot animal, that's when they're extremely unstable. High temperature, plus the fact that they are designed to be very sensitive to heat so that they're flexible at room temperature, means that you shouldn't eat them if you're going to live at 98 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's okay for the frogs and snakes to eat these omega-6 and omega-3 oils because they're cold-blooded and won't heat those fats up to oxidize them. Whereas because we should be around 98 or 99 degrees Fahrenheit, we're going to rapidly oxidize those and turn them into free radicals. Is that what you're saying?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. In some studies, they decided to see how efficient fish oil was as an energy source for fish. Naturally, it has to be liquid enough to function at a cool temperature. But they added some animal fat—more saturated fat—to a salmon diet and then put them through an endurance test. The salmon that were eating salmon fat had the endurance that they would have if you gave them a little more saturated fat.

## Lipofuscin Formation

**Andrew Murray:** Let's focus on lipofuscin—its danger, its buildup, and how it's virtually impossible to detox from. It gets bound up in neurons and is an aging causative factor implicated in neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starting in the 1930s, to explain why food got rancid, the process of breakdown of fats inside tissues was studied. People learned to manufacture something that looked and functioned like lipofuscin by reacting, for example, copper and vitamin C, iron, and just about any kind of fat and various biological components.

You can see that the free radical process is triggered by the copper or iron and a reductant, such as vitamin C, that attracts the oily materials—especially if they're unsaturated—and causes a spreading catalytic oxidative process that creates more free radicals.

You can identify various things that pour out of tissues depending on which tissue you start the process in. If it's the liver and you're under the influence of estrogen or alcohol, the liver is going to produce lots of porphyrin, a chemical used for making heme. That porphyrin will spontaneously amplify the formation of the lipofuscin.

Tissue injury of any sort releases fragments of the damaged cell material, and all of that contributes to the formation of lipofuscin. At first, it can be only in a soluble form. It can travel outside of cells, between cells, through the connective tissue, through the bloodstream, and back into cells in different parts of the organism. Some of it forms only as particles in lysosomes or mitochondria. It varies with every organ and the momentary conditions of the organ.

It is a very powerful way of explaining disease, degeneration, and aging.

**Andrew Murray:** Did you say that lipofuscin can be soluble?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. The smaller particles form soluble, medium-sized molecules.

**Andrew Murray:** I always related lipofuscin with the age pigment you see on the hands of older people. I thought it was always an insoluble complex of iron, protein, and sugar residues that got laid down into the nervous tissue and was resistant to being removed. But you're saying there is some lipofuscin that is soluble and freely moving about. Is it able to be excreted at that point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. Some of it shows up in the urine.

**Andrew Murray:** If that's the case, is there any mileage in supposing that bitters or aperitifs—things that stimulate bile and improve digestion—could have a positive effect in removing soluble lipofuscin before it gets converted into something less soluble?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. Accelerating your digestive processes in general will help.

**Andrew Murray:** What is the difference between the lipofuscin found in endothelial plaque and the lipofuscin found as Lewy bodies or amyloid plaque in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on the type of injury and exposure, the type of fat and the quantity you're exposed to, as well as natural factors such as hormones. There is such variation. If it's going to be extremely fat-loving material, that means it's going to stick in your nerve cells primarily. Huntington's disease is very closely connected to certain types of PUFA-derived lipofuscin. Each variation of lipofuscin molecule is going to affect which kind of nerve is affected in exactly what way.

If you know that it's a matter of balance between how fast you're putting it in and how fast you can remove it, the process of removal is very slow. But if you essentially stop the formation by stopping your excess intake of aluminum, iron, copper, unsaturated fats, and other irritants, then you can reduce the formation almost to zero. At which point the slight attrition by way of vitamin E can gradually reduce the amount in the brain.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think fish oil would be far more implicated in the production of these lipofuscins over flaxseed oil or corn oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The type of molecule is extremely variable. In some early studies feeding a lot of fish to pigs, horses, dogs, and mink, they identified something called "yellow fat disease" in which the animal's fat became a source of dangerous inflammation. It accumulated in a form that created an intense degenerative inflammation throughout the fat system.

## Caller Questions

**Andrew Murray:** Let's take a caller. You're on the air.

**Caller:** I'm from Garberville. My question is, as a general rule, I love organic coconut milk and I'm wondering what its benefits are. I'm also wondering what other nut milks you recommend.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not especially wild about coconut milk. Studies in the Philippines have found that people who cook with it frequently have a high incidence of breast cancer. So I'm not sure about what its natural contents are.

**Caller:** Basically, I'm asking about drinking the coconut milk without heating it, just using it as a general rule on a cool basis.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it's just the actual water—if you puncture an unripe coconut and get the water out—that's fine. But what they call coconut milk or cream is a manufactured process where they grind up some of the solid material and suspend it in the water. I don't think it's safe.

**Caller:** What nut milks do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think there's such a thing. They can make any emulsion that's white and liquid and call it a milk—grain milk, bean milk, or nut milk—but that doesn't have any nutritional value in a positive sense.

**Caller:** You were mentioning linoleic acid. What other related acids would you highly recommend that we do consume?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coconut oil in itself has some real adaptogenic properties by interfering with the PUFA.

**Andrew Murray:** It's thermogenic, obviously it's saturated, so it doesn't have the side effects of being converted into a lipofuscin product.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Can I just clarify for that caller? Dr. Peat really only recommends coconut oil. He does not recommend the omega-3 or omega-6 seed oils, or nut milk, or bean milk.

## Vitamin C and Orange Juice

**Andrew Murray:** I caught you saying a little while ago that other reductants like vitamin C could drive lipofuscin production in the presence of those n-3 and n-6 fats. Did I hear that correctly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Too much vitamin C easily activates any stray atoms you have of aluminum, iron, zinc, mercury, and so on.

**Andrew Murray:** How does that relate to orange juice? If people are drinking lots of orange juice but still eating products containing these oils, wouldn't that vitamin C be a danger?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure, but there are so many chemicals other than vitamin C. Citrus fruit in general, grape juice, fruits and vegetables very widely contain bioflavonoids. Inside the cell, they are oxidants. In the right quantity, vitamin C is an oxidant inside the healthy, non-cancerous cell. The function of antioxidation of the bioflavonoids and vitamin C comes when you get the right amount in cells, which activates oxidative processes absorbing potentially stray electrons that would contribute to lipofuscin.

**Andrew Murray:** I frequently drink half a gallon of orange juice a day during the summer. I'm obviously not consuming any PUFA at the same time. But you say "in moderation."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You're getting equally large amounts of the other pro-oxidant bioflavonoids [in the juice], and so they are helping to keep the cell oxidizing. But if you take, say, 5 grams of vitamin C [as a supplement], then you get this gigantic surge of reductive energy that throws cells in just the opposite direction, turning on the lipofuscin carcinogenic degenerative process.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So basically, if you're getting a half a gallon of orange juice, you might have quite a lot of vitamin C there, but it's also balanced by the bioflavonoids—the naringin and the quercetin—so it doesn't cause a problem.

**Andrew Murray:** Would you condone the use of citrus bioflavonoid supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the purified form, some of those can be reductants the same way an excess of vitamin C can. I think one bioflavonoid probably intensifies and works with the system in the same fruit.

## Milk Consumption

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** We had a caller with bad reception who wanted to ask: Why do you think cow milk is okay for humans since we're the only species that drinks another species' milk after being weaned?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it has to do with the size of our brain and our culture. We have evolved on a high fruit, high carbohydrate diet. In that diet, a very high calcium intake happens to synergize with the other factors to optimize brain function.

## Vitamin E Recommendations

**Andrew Murray:** Can I ask about vitamin E's protective antioxidant role? I've read articles talking about vitamin E mitigating some of the effects of these n-3 and n-6 fats and the formation of lipofuscin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The definition of vitamin E has changed radically since the first studies in the 1920s and 30s. It was originally thought of as a fertility-extending, anti-estrogen chemical. But then as the toxic effects of unsaturated fats became identified, vitamin E lost its anti-estrogen mystique and was shifted over to nothing but an antioxidant. But that has now changed back, and it's coming to be recognized again that it's an anti-inflammatory, estrogen-regulating substance.

**Andrew Murray:** What kind of daily dose would you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Something like 20 or 30 milligrams.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** How does that compare to International Units (IU)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The language has simply changed. You can talk about the different forms in terms of milligrams. Sometimes they're still talking in terms of the antioxidant value or the D-alpha tocopherol concentration. For about 20 years you could only refer to D-alpha tocopherol as vitamin E potency; the gamma and delta mixed tocopherols had to be overlooked. But now that effect is disappearing.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So when you state 20 to 30 milligrams, you're stating 20 to 30 milligrams of a mixed tocopherol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Estrogen and Inflammation

**Andrew Murray:** Very lastly, Dr. Peat, regarding estrogen. You've always talked about estrogen being inflammatory and progesterone being the anti-inflammatory molecule. Estrogen's inflammatory nature in terms of its effect on the n-3 and n-6 fats and lipofuscin formation is equivocal, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. You can treat all of these things as synergizing either beneficial factors or harmful factors. The amount of PUFA, ionizing radiation, exposure to heavy metals—each of the components is at least additive to the others. If you do something to oppose any one of those—reducing inflammation—you're going to reduce estrogen exposure, rate of aging, tissue fibrosis, and cancer. All of these can be alleviated by simple natural anti-inflammatory things including carbon dioxide, progesterone, and thyroid function.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you very much, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat can be found online at www.raypeat.com.

I think what I wanted to bring out from the show was that the concept of these polyunsaturated fatty acids being health beneficial is completely erroneous. There are things we can do to mitigate the absorption and permanence of these things. I wasn't aware that some lipofuscin can be soluble. Digestive bitters, hepatic stimulants, and laxatives will certainly be beneficial strategies, especially for people switching their fat sources to saturated.

Until the third Friday of next month, my name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you very much for listening.
