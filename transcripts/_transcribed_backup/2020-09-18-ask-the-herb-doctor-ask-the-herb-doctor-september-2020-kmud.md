**Speaker A** (00:00): Slot. Well, we have a space in that underwriter slot too. You can call office 923-2513 during business hours, ask to speak to our underwriting representative, Rochelle. And you too could be supporting kmud. And it's time for Ask your Herb Doctor in just a minute. I know a whole bunch of people are tuning in from around the nation and around the world. And please consider clicking the donate button on our website because we are not exactly your community radio station. But you're listening to us, therefore we are your community radio station. And we could really use some of your economic support going into our rural backwoods pockets because we're kind of broke around here. We do provide programming which is unique to the global world and would appreciate your support for it. We are Redwood Community Radio, KMED, Garberville, KMUE, Eureka, K L A I Laytonville, kmud.org where the views and opinions expressed throughout the broadcast day are those of the speakers and not necessarily those of the station, its staff, underwriters or volunteers. Time is made available for all sorts of viewpoints. And thank you so much for joining us. So let me get the theme music started, then I'll answer the phone. I don't think it's the doctor yet, but.

**Speaker B** (02:43): Sam.

**Speaker A** (03:16): Okay, I have the good doctors.

**Speaker C** (03:21): Welcome to this month's Ask YOUR Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Speaker D** (03:25): My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show this evening.

**Speaker C** (03:29): For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm we are both registered medical herbalists. I graduated from England and Sarah graduated.

**Speaker D** (03:43): From England with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

**Speaker C** (03:48): We produce and manufacture extracts of different herbs that are used commonly in Europe as herbal medicines. And we want to establish the truth in these monthly radio shows surrounding alternatives to the regular medicines, just so people have alternatives to look at and examine for themselves. So you're listening to ask your herb Dr. Kmud 91.1 FM from 7:30 to the end of the show at 8:00'. Clock. You're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's continuing topic of COVID 19. And the number is 707-923-3911. That's 707-923-391100 from 7:30 till the end of the show at 8:00'.

**Speaker B** (04:40): Clock.

**Speaker C** (04:41): Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Pete join us.

**Speaker B** (04:45): Dr. Pete yes, hi.

**Speaker C** (04:47): Well, thanks for joining us again. Before I go into the introduction to this month's lineup here. We've got questions for you and new evidence. Just trying to get to the bottom of all of this and find the truth. Would you just outline your professional and your academic background for people listening who perhaps have not heard of you before?

**Speaker B** (05:10): From the University of Oregon, 1960, I got a master's degree in humanities related subject. Then 1972, PhD in biology concentrating on physiology, especially the reproductive physiology in aging. And since 1972 I've been writing and studying and doing some counseling.

**Speaker C** (05:47): Okay, well, very good. And for those people that are listening both now and at the end of the show, I'll give out your information, Dr. Pete, so people can find out more for themselves. It's www.raypeat r a Y-P-E-A-T.com and there's lots of articles written by you but fully referenced. And as I said at the beginning of the show, the truth.

**Speaker B** (06:10): If you.

**Speaker C** (06:11): Listen and you hear me, you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free. I wanted to preface the introduction for this month by saying that it's not for pointing the finger of blame, but for the freedom which knowledge can bring. Is the Internet a platform for destabilizing central control and disseminating information in the objective scientific form, which is impartial and non political? I've always quoted in these monthly radio shows from time to time since they started with kmud back in 2004, that saying the words he who has ears to hear, let him hear. There are many crying out in the wilderness, as it were, of the World Wide web, battling censorship and oppression to tell the truth, and none more so than the people of China under the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party with its self proclaimed lockstep mentality with the Tiananmen Square massacre being the pivotal side beginning of this tragic oppression and government control of a beautifully poetic, creative, intelligent and skilled nation's people. Information and knowledge cannot be silenced in a free world or democracy, protecting its inalienable and sovereign rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. As we've mentioned before, enshrined in our constitution and with it, the truth is paramount to level the playing field. So with this in mind, the revelation this week of Dr. Li Meng Yen, and we'll go over the biography and contact details. He's an MD and PhD scientist working in the Hong Kong School of Public Health who since fled to the US to escape persecution from the Chinese PCP. That Chinese people, Chinese people's gosh, it's gone. It's escaped my mind. I'm Sorry, the Chinese Communist Party, the ccp. I beg your pardon. Okay, so basically she's saying that COVID 19 was engineered in the Wuhan laboratory and it's revelational. Although we have heard from other people that I wanted to question you about to begin with, like Dr. Luke Montagne, the Nobel Prize winner, throughout his discovery of aids. But it's not the first time that this has been alluded to, but another voice in the wilderness, as it were, not for blaming, but for the truth to come out. It's been posited by Dr. Luc Montagnier, as I mentioned, the Nobel Prize winner for finding aids in AB2, that Covid has been genetically altered and has some elements of malaria and HIV in its genome. And that perhaps the researchers in Wuhan, we're attempting to create a vaccine for aids. I know that's been mentioned, but the National Biosafety Lab in Wuhan specializes in these different coronaviruses and since the early 2000s, done the same. So not for blaming China, but to navigate these waters, we as a species now find ourselves faced with and to cover the actual mortality of this disease and how this event is profoundly affecting our freedom and association. That's the reason that we're doing this. So thanks again for joining us. Dr. P. Before we started, can I just go back to somewhat the beginning in April, but this Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Luc Montagne's interview on French TV, I know it had subtitles to it, but because I don't think he speaks English, but it was in French, he was saying that it was quite clearly genetically altered. And it kind of revelation blew my mind when I heard it. And, you know, he's a Nobel Prize winner, not a conspiracy theorist. So as I said in the beginning, just the facts, you know, so we can have the truth and the truth can set us free. What do you think of the reference to those two diseases in the genome? Because some people on the Internet will say, well, there are other coronaviruses that have elements of malaria and HIV in them. I mean, is that. Do you see that that is possible?

**Speaker B** (10:18): Oh, naturally. When someone prominent like that points out how easy it is to engineer such a virus, people jump on it and say, no, it isn't possible to create it in the lab. Earlier, a couple months earlier, I think when people were talking about it coming out of a germ warfare lab or being deliberately released, some of the people involved in working on the virus immediately published a paper in Nature. Nature serves as, in many ways, the voice of the establishment, military establishment and secret government Establishment. But they published a paper claiming that it was impossible to create that particular virus in a lab. But I had been reading for a long time publications coming out of North Carolina, University of North Carolina, lab of Ralph Baric. And he was describing in detail the changes that they made in coronaviruses and other similar viruses and specifically how to make them more infectious to humans, changing an animal virus to a virus that would be infectious in humans. So Luc Montagnier simply applied his knowledge of virology and, and quickly could demonstrate the specific changes that had been made.

**Speaker C** (12:15): This is directly opposing the Geneva Convention, right? When they outlawed biological and other weapons.

**Speaker B** (12:25): Yeah, Richard Nixon was one who closed the germ warfare lab in, in the United States in 1969. And there was a general, I think, treaty recognition around the world that no one would continue designing lethal viruses for military use. But they immediately started saying that just in case someone violates the convention and does produce one, we need to have a vaccine ready. So we'll have to make these extremely dangerous viruses so we can practice making a vaccine. Even though historically, for decades, people have been trying to make a vaccine against common cold viruses, never succeeded because the viruses change so fast. So the story that they were having to make toxic, human infecting viruses out of animal viruses so they could make a vaccine in case someone else made them, at best, there were 200 virologists who signed a letter saying, this is crazy, because even with the best precautions, accidents happen. In fact, in the Fort Detrick lab, I think there were a thousand accidents identified which could have leaked toxic viruses into the environment. They happen every few days. In even these highest security labs. Someone forgets to turn a valve or clean the pipes or put on a mask or whatever. But the accidents are essentially unavoidable. So if you're designing, they call it gain of function. Research a virus that never could infect mammals or humans, for example, they find out what the viruses, how the viruses that do infect humans, what they use to become infectious, and then they simply take the genes creating those proteins and insert those genes into some virus that produces the symptoms they want to produce. So it's very standard gene engineering. There's nothing impossible about pretty much making any DNA sequence you want. You can change one base at a time, or you can take a block of genes out of a virus and transfer that as a block. So the engineering is all very well standardized and known around the world.

**Speaker C** (15:48): I wonder how on earth is it allowed, though? Because it sounds like exact contravention of the Geneva Convention, doesn't it?

**Speaker B** (15:56): Yeah, there are. I forget how many of these labs around the world. The Republic of Georgia has a big one similar to the Wuhan lab or the North Carolina lab, one of the African countries, I forget which Nigeria or one country. A very strange place to be making toxic viruses. But I think Romania is another country that has a lab where you would be very surprised that they had the technology to work at that level or any reason to do so.

**Speaker D** (16:43): Well, isn't that why Dr. Fauci went to Wuhan in the first place, was because the US Government didn't want him doing that type of research and experiments?

**Speaker B** (16:55): After those 200 virologists said there should be some serious thought given to this practice, there was a moratorium placed and almost immediately Fauci transferred technology to Wuhan.

**Speaker D** (17:16): Okay, so if this Coronavirus COVID 19 was engineered in a lab in Wuhan and it has gene sequences from AIDS and malaria and who knows what else, what do you think about people getting sick with it? Do you think there's going to be long term consequences?

**Speaker B** (17:40): Do you think has turned out to be slightly more infectious than a standard flu or cold virus? Definitely more infectious, but not really much more harmful in the sense of killing people.

**Speaker D** (18:03): Well, could there be any long term effect because they've altered this virus?

**Speaker B** (18:09): Yeah, all of the things like influenza that create serious respiratory disease, sensational respiratory virus, the coronaviruses and influenza, these all create inflammation in the lungs and throughout the body. The clotting diseases that they have claimed are specific to coronavirus, that's been knowledge for I think about 30 years that people after an attack of influenza are more likely to have a stroke or other blood clotting event. Heart attacks and strokes because of the inflammation in the lungs, damages the lungs ability to detoxify hormones. For example, almost all of the body's inflammation creating serotonin travels from the intestine through the blood to the lungs. A little bit is detoxified in the liver, but most of it is destroyed in a healthy lung, stopping the inflammatory process that excess serotonin could cause. But if you knock out your lungs ability by inflaming them with influenza, then the serotonin goes on to cause vascular spasms, clots, various kinds of inflammation throughout the body. All of the strange things that have been blamed on coronavirus, it's simply the result of seriously inflamed lungs. And for some reason, the standardized reaction imposed from above on hospitals was to quickly give respiratory pumping, slightly higher concentration oxygen directly into their lungs. And when you accelerate breathing Increase the oxygen delivery to the lungs. That in itself creates inflammation, reduces the lungs ability to detoxify serotonin, leads to all of the inflammatory things getting worse. So the extremely high mortality rate in the early weeks when they were practically in some hospitals, they were putting a tube into all of the COVID diagnosed patients and they were having from 60 to 100% mortality in those hospitals. But in nearby hospitals where they had someone actually thinking about what's needed when you have inflamed lungs, they had essentially zero mortality, showing that almost 100% of the mortality was caused by ignorant application of these respirators.

**Speaker D** (21:46): So do you think that this COVID 19, because it's been genetically engineered in a lab, do you think it's more dangerous than just a normal coronavirus, influenza, or do you think it causes the same amount of the same type of damage in the lungs as the normal flu? And it's not.

**Speaker B** (22:04): The rate of deaths for infection are very slightly higher than influenza, but it's something that you have to look very hard to find. The greater mortality per infection, it's impractical since it's just a bad flu season. The whole panic has no basis at all when you consider the unemployment and loss of businesses is going to increase mortality from other causes. That very, very small increase in respiratory disease mortality is dwarfed by the harm you're doing to the world population by knocking out the economy.

**Speaker D** (23:13): So in a bad flu year, I think it was like 2017, 88,000 people died of influenza and that was considered a bad year. And now Worldometer says there's 203,000 deaths from coronavirus or this COVID 19. But we don't really know if that's all COVID 19. Like even Deborah Birx said that there's going to be a percentage of those deaths that are being labeled. You know, the cdc, Deborah Birx said there's a percentage of those deaths, there's 203,000 deaths that are the other types of influenza that kill people every year. So when you say it's just like a little bit slightly worse than a bad flu year, are you taking that into consideration?

**Speaker B** (24:00): Yeah, the instructions given for filling out death certificates and for diagnosing. There is really no clear definition of how to tell when someone is sick from the coronavirus or whether the coronavirus is simply incidental to some other cause of their pneumonia and sickness. But by the instructions they were given, if there was evidence of the presence of a virus and the person died, then you had to disregard that they died of a car accident or cancer or heart disease or bacterial pneumonia. If they died and had the presence of the coronavirus, they were said to have died from coronavirus. Absolutely unscientific, unmedical.

**Speaker D** (25:13): Well, the CDC also came out with in the last month a statistic saying that 94% of coronavirus fatalities or COVID 19 fatalities, so deaths were actually comorbidities. The people who died had heart disease and, or diabetes and other conditions, chronic disease that could have killed them. And they weren't 100% sure if it was a COVID 19 death.

**Speaker B** (25:42): Yeah, when you look at the phony diagnosis of death cause it looks like it might not even be as harmful as a standard influenza virus. It's hard to tell because there's no science being done. It's all political decisions.

**Speaker D** (26:06): So I guess we just have to wait until it's. All the information is out and all the figures are out and then you look at the excess mortality and did more people die in 2020 than in 2019, 2018? You know, and look at it for years back and compare. Is that what you basically think is the only way to know?

**Speaker B** (26:27): Normally the CDC has taken two weeks for years past. Within two weeks the death figures coming in from around the country had been compiled and remained stable. But the first few months of 2020 showed many fewer people dying from all causes in the US and then in mid summer the CDC went back and altered figures as far back as 25 weeks and raised the death figures so that they conformed to the usual preceding years. But until they did that historically unprecedented long range revision of history, fewer deaths had occurred in the US than in a normal year.

**Speaker D** (27:35): So basically we won't really know because if they're able to alter the figures that way, how do we know any of the figures are true at all?

**Speaker B** (27:42): That's my opinion.

**Speaker C** (27:45): Okay, you're listening to ask Europe. Dr. Kmed Garbival 91.1 FM. From 7:30 to the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to the ongoing discussion surrounding coronavirus, its origin, the treatment, etc. The number 707-923-3911. Once again, 707923, 3911. Our guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peek.

**Speaker A** (28:14): And we have a caller already.

**Speaker C** (28:16): Okay, well let's go ahead and take this call and see where we're going with questions, see if they're, if you're on the air, caller, where are you from? What's Your question?

**Speaker E** (28:25): I'm from the East Coast. Just one comment on your line of discussion and then I have a separate question. The lady was right in China that it was released there. But there's a patent in 2003. This has been worked on for more than a decade. In 2007, they changed the patent to make it private. And as Dr. Pete alluded to, in 2015, when they shut down the Fort Detrick lab, they moved it and they funded Wuhan with $3.7 million. This has been premeditated for more than a decade.

**Speaker D** (28:58): Yes, and we did discuss that at one of our earlier coronavirus shows.

**Speaker E** (29:02): Yeah, so yeah, the lady's half right, but it's, it's plausible deniability for both countries. Anyway, my question relates to something that I've not found on any of your information. It relates to a tear of a tendon which actually just connects a muscle with a bone. In particular, I know someone with two rotator cuff tears, partial tear in one of the rotator cuff muscles and another full tear. And so he's in his mid-60s. So as a result, you know, with lack of arm mobility, if you don't actually move it around, you can actually get what they guess they call frozen shoulder. And even in the absence of surgery, it can take from what up until one to three years to get, you know, even partial recovery. So my question relates to whether you've had any experience with folks that have had these types of injuries. And just a point on the current technology for surgery is to incorporate a suture which stays in there the whole time, and a non metal connector which I believe is some plastic material and non metal material that goes into the bone so that you can connect the tendon to the bone so that over time it will reattach, but absent that, it'll never reattach. And so I'm just wondering. That's a pretty difficult and very technical area of the body. And I'm just wondering whether in the circumstances for current technology, you have any views on having a suture in a non metal plastic piece forever for the rest of your life versus sort of just doing nothing and keeping it detached or both of them partially.

**Speaker C** (30:55): How about this, Dr. Pete? What do you think of platelet rich plasma?

**Speaker E** (31:00): Actually, Andrew, Andrew, that's a separate question.

**Speaker C** (31:03): I'd like to ask a minute until you let Dr. Pete answer that. And then if you want to hang tight there, you can ask your next question. You said one question.

**Speaker E** (31:12): I just have the question that I asked about the rotator cuff and the Surgery. That's my.

**Speaker D** (31:17): Yeah, and we're answering that. We're asking Dr. Pete what he thinks of platelet rich plasma.

**Speaker C** (31:22): If you listen to the question, you'd understand it, caller. So Dr. Pete, would you think that platelet rich plasma might be a suitable modality to try to kind of.

**Speaker B** (31:36): Sorry, if I can interrupt.

**Speaker E** (31:37): I'm asking him a question about the engineer.

**Speaker C** (31:40): You know, I don't want to deal with this corner. He's pretty antagonistic and won't let Dr. Pete talk. So can we just hold him up?

**Speaker B** (31:46): If a person is in perfect health when some kind of unusual accident causes that rotator cuff injury, then surgery has a pretty good chance of making a permanent repair because the tissues are strong and can tolerate the implanted materials. But usually it happens when the person is in their 40s or 50s and is experiencing hormonal changes, increased stress hormones that weaken the connective tissues. And there are treatments such as the platelet rich plasma that will stimulate fibrous tissue growth. But I think the essential thing is to restore the hormonal balance that builds healthy connective tissue gets the ratio of cortisol to the protective dhea, testosterone and progesterone and pregnenolone lowers that ratio of cortisol so that the connective tissues repair themselves rather than being weakened by the stress hormones. And I've known I guess half a dozen shoulder people, some knee people and various other connective tissue diseases such as uterine prolapse hernias in various places, midline or groin hernias that instead of having to implant a plastic or metal repair material if they get their anti stress system back, sometimes just taking adequate amounts of vitamin D will toughen up the connective tissues. Vitamin D works on the fascia and tendons and ligaments as well as the bones, toughening everything and helping to keep things in their proper place.

**Speaker D** (34:18): So I just want to everyone listening. It's vitamin D like the sunshine hormone.

**Speaker E** (34:24): Not by the way I heard. Let me just ask a follow up. So they also mentioned to them that cortisone shot would be good because initially after the injury the inflammation on an MRI was extremely obvious. And you know, you've discussed the negatives of cortisone. So to your earlier point, applying like progesterone in a like 5 or 6 to 1 ratio with DHEA on the location and maybe putting CO2 gas over the area might be alternatives to try to get the inflammation down. Are these the right methods or are there other things that should be done? Or do you think cortisone shot in this instance may be appropriate.

**Speaker B** (35:08): No anti inflammatories are safer than cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids that they use, which are even worse than cortisol. Right. But getting enough into the tissue is the essential thing. And usually these people have supplemented them orally as well as anointing the areas very thoroughly, the arm, the shoulder, the torso, around the injured area, for example, or the whole leg in the case of the knee. But, but getting the body level up to the point that your natural stress induced cortisol isn't going to be counteracting the healing process. Testosterone supplements can contribute to the process if they're balanced with vitamin D and thyroid hormone and anti inflammatories.

**Speaker E** (36:14): So the topical thing you were talking about was that the progesterone combination I was talking about or some other substance?

**Speaker B** (36:20): Yeah. People have generally used a mixture of progesterone and dhea, sometimes with testosterone when that was available.

**Speaker E** (36:32): Well, I'm using it without it. I mean, it's actually like six, seven to one, because I guess topically you gotta get 10 times the amount, I guess. But I don't know if that's the right ratio or whether it matters. But I'm a little concerned that if you're older, like if you're over 60, that the conversion to estrogen with the DHA is a problem. Because there's no doubt that anybody over 60, maybe other than you, is clinically hypothyroid.

**Speaker B** (37:00): Yeah. That's the reason for making sure that your vitamin D and calcium intake and thyroid hormone are all adequate to keep your estrogen under control so that you don't turn your DHEA and testosterone into estrogen.

**Speaker E** (37:21): Okay, so just a last confirmation, I'll let you go. And I appreciate the clarity of your answer. So if there's only one technique that's used today by the best doctors and that is to put some sort of non metal piece into the bone and have a suture in there where literally they both remain there for the rest of your life. You're not troubled by the fact that maybe it disintegrates or maybe.

**Speaker B** (37:45): Yeah, that's exactly the problem. Dental implants are the same idea. You have to look at the hormonal situation. Some people have very, very bad results from implanting anything. If you're in good health generally you might be able to tolerate implants without symptoms. Yeah.

**Speaker E** (38:09): So. But if you have a tendon that's detached from the bone and you don't reconnect it. How do you get.

**Speaker A** (38:15): We've got a bunch of other callers.

**Speaker C** (38:17): Yeah, I appreciate your caller from New York and I think you've had plenty of time. If you need to ask anything else, perhaps email. That would be a good idea. So if we have other calls in the wings there, engineer, you want to pass them through? Let's take this next call, the call.

**Speaker B** (38:34): You're on the air. What's your question?

**Speaker A** (38:36): It's busy. They gave up. We've got a slot open now.

**Speaker D** (38:42): I just want to say something about the DHEA and the testosterone use with people that might be supplementing with these hormones. Dr. Pete usually recommends no more than 5 to 10 milligrams for a woman, 5 milligrams for a woman under 50, maybe up to 10 for a woman over 50, and then for men, 10 milligrams, maybe 20 milligrams. Dr. P. I know sometimes you've said that's okay, but what you've also said, Dr. P, is that taking a blood test to check your levels of estradiol when you're supplementing with DHEA is a good idea because you don't want to be getting too high estradiol levels when you're supplementing with DHEA.

**Speaker B** (39:24): Yeah. Even 10 milligrams a day can be far too much for someone who's hypothyroid or lacking vitamin D.

**Speaker D** (39:36): And that's another thing you can get tested with. A blood test is vitamin D. So these hormones might be very useful for people. But it's also common that I come across clients who are taking 25-50mg of DHEA a day and they're not going to their doctor and asking for any blood tests to look at the levels of estradiol and make sure those aren't rising to dangerous levels.

**Speaker B** (39:59): Yeah. And in connection with the ligament detachment, if a thing is immobilized and kept in proper relationship to the bone, regrowth is going to happen. Things spontaneously grow together.

**Speaker D** (40:23): But I've also heard that when people have their ligaments detached around their knee, that surgery is only 50% effective. So half of the people who have detached ligaments heal up just fine, so they must reattach. And half the people who get the surgery do good on it and half don't. So that must be possible if statistics like that come out.

**Speaker C** (40:48): Okay, you listen to ask your Dr. Kamie D. Galville 91.1 FM from now until the end of the show at 8 o', clock, you're invited to call in the questions either related to coronavirus or allied to it. Numbers 707-923-3911. Dr. Raymond Peake, guest speaker. Do we have any other callers waiting there?

**Speaker A** (41:12): Oh, no, we don't. We only have one slot open because it's crowded here. So yes, give a call and if it's busy, call back.

**Speaker B** (41:20): Okay.

**Speaker C** (41:20): All right, so Dr. Pete, between Luke Montagniere, I want to just highlight this other whistleblower quote unquote between Luke Montagniere, Nobel Prize winner, between saying that this virus is engineered and Ralph barracks lab in North Carolina saying that the spike protein had definitely been altered. The latest to come to the fore, although I did see an earlier post on this person, but I don't think the press picked it up. And this was just a couple of days ago, a Dr. Li Meng Yen, who's a virologist in Hong Kong, she basically is completely blown the whistle on, online, on the Internet from various outlets. You can type her name into YouTube search. So her name is Lee L I Space M E N G space Y E N. I did see there was a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson and there was a loose women post where four Europeans. Actually there's a British either public figures or newscasters and they were women in England who were interviewing her. And she said categorically that it was manufactured. She was basically threatened to be silenced or as she called it, disappeared. And that she is about to release just the facts, the facts.

**Speaker D** (42:53): Verifiable evidence.

**Speaker C** (42:55): Yeah, that this, this virus was indeed engineered. And she says it's completely, you know, the Chinese Communist Party are completely behind silencing this. And that's why I asked you earlier, Dr. Pete, that the typical explanation is given is that they're doing research, vaccine research, which you know is altruistic and is helping people. But you've mentioned already that this is something that's actually so close to breaking the Geneva Convention because it's kind of so easy to cover it up this way by saying that's what they were doing rather than producing some biological weapon. So people that are listening that you can go on YouTube and you can type in the name Li Meng Yen, she'll confirm what Luke Montagne and Ralph back have revealed. And that's another part of parcel of the Internet and speech. That's what I wrote the beginning of the show in.

**Speaker A** (43:51): And we have callers.

**Speaker C** (43:54): Okay, let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where you from? What's your question?

**Speaker B** (43:59): Hi, is this me?

**Speaker C** (44:00): Yeah, you're on the air. What's your question, caller?

**Speaker B** (44:03): Hi, this is Bruce from Garberville and I'd like to know what Dr. Pete thinks of the inhalation of Brown's gas or hydrogen gas inhalation or drinking it in infused water. And I'll take my answer on the air. Thank you. I'm glad you're there. Thank you.

**Speaker D** (44:23): Thank you for your call.

**Speaker C** (44:24): Did you get that question?

**Speaker B** (44:25): Dota Pete, breathing hydrogen gas? Yeah, yeah, it's anti inflammatory. I think the right percentage of carbon dioxide is the most important thing. And since we make our own carbon dioxide, avoiding hyperventilation or being dosed with concentrated oxygen is the first thing to consider. But breathing a little hydrogen is anti inflammatory.

**Speaker C** (45:02): Okay, there you go.

**Speaker A** (45:03): And we have another caller.

**Speaker E** (45:05): Okay, good.

**Speaker B** (45:06): All right, Callie, you're on the air.

**Speaker C** (45:07): Where you from?

**Speaker E** (45:08): What's your question?

**Speaker D** (45:09): Hi neighbors, it's Tara.

**Speaker B** (45:12): I'm so grateful for your viewpoints on Covid.

**Speaker D** (45:15): I tuned in a little bit late but I don't know if you've addressed the mask issue.

**Speaker B** (45:22): I'm wondering if you could. Or I can go back and listen.

**Speaker C** (45:27): That's a good reminder.

**Speaker D** (45:29): Thank you.

**Speaker B** (45:29): I'm going to hang up and hear it off. Thank you so much.

**Speaker C** (45:33): It just came out.

**Speaker D** (45:33): Thank you for your call.

**Speaker E** (45:34): It just came out.

**Speaker C** (45:35): This week was another interview, actually it was the same one for Dr. Lee Merrick. She was talking about the futility of wearing masks. And last month we did a show which that was one of the questions and saying that essentially the micron size of coronavirus is far more than an N95 mask and filter out so that you are going to get not only respired particles through the mask, but that they are not proper bacteriological respirators. So they are going to leak air from the nose, etc. Around the folds of the nose. And so they are not at all patent, they are not competent and a.

**Speaker B** (46:22): Simple cloth mask is even because the cores are gigantic in comparison to the size of the virus, which is one eighth of a micron in diameter. And recently the smoke exposure has been causing increased sickness and probably death from heart disease, respiratory problems, asthma and kidney disease, overlapping greatly with things blamed on viruses. The smoke particles that are most toxic are just the size of the coronavirus and smaller all the way down to about a tenth the diameter of even the coronavirus. And so for big particles of soot or dust, an N95 mask is very helpful. But for even average sized bacteria and especially the sub micron size of the coronavirus and smoke particles, they do very little to protect you.

**Speaker D** (47:52): That's a great YouTube video by Lee Merritt. It's called SARS Covid 2 and the Rise of Medical Technocracy. So you guys can look that up if you want to watch some more detail about why mask wearing is just not scientific.

**Speaker C** (48:11): Yeah, basically, that's it. It's not scientific. And that's what we tried to bring out last month, but we received a few heated calls about it. But unfortunately, it's part and parcel of the world we're living in. And sometimes the science gets derailed by authoritarianism, I think. And that's what's part and parcel of this ongoing pandemic.

**Speaker A** (48:31): And you've got another caller.

**Speaker E** (48:33): Okay, good.

**Speaker C** (48:34): So, caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question? I am calling from Bryceland.

**Speaker B** (48:40): I'd like to ask a simple question. In fact, a yes or no answer would be perfect. Does wearing a mask reduce spread?

**Speaker C** (48:55): Thank you. All right, Dr. P, how would you weigh in on that one?

**Speaker B** (49:02): There is no scientific evidence it does. So I would say no. But in waiting for further research, it's a possibility that it does. But in the absence of evidence, there were, I think it was 17 properly controlled studies, properly interpreted on the right sort of populations, and the honest sort of evaluation at the end of the study, all of those 17 have failed to produce any evidence.

**Speaker A** (49:48): K mud. No, no. You got to ask yourself. You got to ask yourself. You're next in line. Please listen on your phone.

**Speaker D** (49:59): Okay, so doctor, I have a question for you. Does wearing a mask help your health in any way by increasing your CO2 that you rebreath?

**Speaker B** (50:12): The problem with using barrier like a mask to increase your CO2, if you have a breathing tube that can be therapeutic because it doesn't increase the pressure. But the problem with a barrier, like especially an N95 mask, when you inhale, you have great resistance sucking air through that fine poured filter and blowing it out. Then you increase the pressure. You have alternating vacuum and pressure on your lungs. That alternating pressure creates inflammation in itself.

**Speaker D** (50:59): So if you, if you have to wear a mask to go into a store, then the cloth masks are safer is what you're saying.

**Speaker B** (51:07): Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A** (51:08): And you have another caller, as you probably heard from my mistakes a minute ago.

**Speaker C** (51:12): Okay, good caller, you're on the airway from. What's your question?

**Speaker B** (51:15): Hello?

**Speaker C** (51:16): Yeah, you're on the air. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Speaker B** (51:20): My name's Mike and I want to.

**Speaker E** (51:21): Know if a vapor mask for painters.

**Speaker B** (51:26): With cloth over it is of any value class over what a painter's mask is.

**Speaker D** (51:35): A painter's mask. It's like an N95 mask, isn't it?

**Speaker A** (51:39): I think he left, but he called it a vapor mask.

**Speaker D** (51:43): Oh, a vapor mask.

**Speaker A** (51:44): That to me implies it's charcoal or something to take care of all the turpentine. But I don't know if someone has more information they could call back.

**Speaker C** (51:52): I really don't think it's sub micron enough, but anyway.

**Speaker B** (51:55): Dr. P. Particles of the sub micron diameter are the main thing causing lung disease. Both viruses and particles such as soot or silica, metal powders, oxides and so on, all of those cause serious systemic and especially lung inflammation. But when you're around chemical fumes, a carbon filter is very, very helpful. If you have a very good big carbon filter that's going to take the chemicals out but not the particles.

**Speaker D** (52:45): Okay, so it will help with chemicals but not with viral particles like COVID 19.

**Speaker C** (52:52): Okay, well you're listening to Ask Europe, Dr. K Me D Galberville, 91.1 FM for the last eight minutes or so to show you're welcome to call in with questions related or unrelated to the coronavirus discussion. The number 707-923-3911. Okay, so do we have any more calls or should we continue to the next.

**Speaker A** (53:13): No, continue on and callers better get a caller in soon because I always let you have the last four minutes to get your info out.

**Speaker B** (53:19): Sure.

**Speaker C** (53:20): All right, well they come in the next couple of minutes, we'll take them for sure. Dr. Pete, I saw a retraction and I wanted to ask you a question about the compound for other uses. The New England Journal of Medicine, Anna Lancet retracted their statement that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in the treatment of COVID And it turned out that the company that conducted the research called Surgispheres could not produce present, could not, would not, did not refuse to present their data set for external audit. And so that raised the question of the validity of the information and they retracted the statement. Essentially it's what Donald Trump for whatever disparaging he's getting for many different fronts, but it's what he's called certainly part and parcel of a treatment. And I know I read and seen plenty of other hospitals in different parts of the world have used hydroxychloroquine. What do you think about hydroxychloroquine in and of itself?

**Speaker B** (54:30): The actual science shows that it's anti inflammatory and is helpful for A great variety of kinds of disease, including a virus in inflammation. Parasites such as malaria, they all cause damage by creating inflammation. And hydroxychloroquine is protective against all of those inflammations. Not that it's the best one, but it definitely hasn't increased mortality by 10%. And any editor should be expected to send a draft of an article to competent people, for example, respiratory specialists. And any respiratory specialist looking at the data, was it 900,000 cases that they were supposed to be or 90,000, I forget which. But anyway, a huge database that had never been cited before. Any competent researcher would know that there was something phony and would ask where that database originated and would have immediately found that it was a complete invention and fraud.

**Speaker A** (56:02): And we have two more callers. Could we try to get them in very quickly?

**Speaker C** (56:05): I don't think we're going to be able to do it, are we? I think it's four minutes to the top of the hour, correct?

**Speaker A** (56:10): Oh, yeah, it is.

**Speaker C** (56:11): So let's hold tight on that because I've got one other thing I'd like.

**Speaker A** (56:15): To say before I'll give them the bad news.

**Speaker D** (56:19): I'm sorry, callers.

**Speaker C** (56:20): Okay, so Dr. P. I also wanted to say this. This also came out in a study that was done on COVID patients that those patients with a higher than 30 nanogram per milliliter blood level, serum level, vitamin D, did significantly better than those who had a level 20 or below were positively correlated with increased death. You all agree with that, correct?

**Speaker B** (56:48): Yeah. Vitamin D is one of the most important opponents of inflammation. It directly prevents the types of inflammation caused by particles or coronavirus or influenza and any infection, in fact. Good.

**Speaker C** (57:11): Okay, well, let's call it good night for this moment and we'll just give out some more information about you. Thanks so much for joining us.

**Speaker B** (57:20): Okay, thank you.

**Speaker D** (57:21): Thank you, Dr. Pete.

**Speaker C** (57:23): Okay, so for those people to the show, if you'd like to find out more about Dr. Pete, it's R A Y P.

**Speaker A** (57:45): Oh my God. I just hung up on the herb doctor there. I'm very, very sorry. WBMERB is their phone number. And that was a really brutal end of the talk show. Dr. Ray Pete can be found@raypeat.com and here's their theme music. Sorry. Support comes from the Redwood Coast Energy Authority which wants the community to know that there are a variety of resources to help customers pay their bills, find the right rate plan and manage their energy use during the current crisis. Visit redwoodenergy.org for complete details or call 707-269-1700 for more information. And once again, that was my fault. I cut off Dr. Well, I cut off both doctors at the end there instead of Dr. Pete. So my apologies for the last 30 seconds of that totally butchered engineering job of the talk show. Well, hopefully Shaka, who is in here to engineer for Shyla.

**Speaker B** (59:02): And I've never butchered a talk show in my life.

**Speaker A** (59:04): I've never butchered he's never even butchered a chicken as far as I know. Yeah, you. But that would be horrible. Yes. So we are redwood Community Radio, KMUD. Sorry, KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM in HD1 KMUE Eureka 88.1 FM in HD1 Klai Laytonville 90.3 FM FM Translator K258BQ in Chelter Cove at 99.5 and live and archived on the web@kmud.org in six seconds it will be 8 o' clock. We have Shyla and Shaka, but it's really just Shyla. But Shaka's just helping Shyla's programming. I'm engineering, so enjoy.
