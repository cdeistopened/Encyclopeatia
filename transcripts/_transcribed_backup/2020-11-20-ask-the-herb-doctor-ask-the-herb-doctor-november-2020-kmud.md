## Transcript

**Speaker A** (00:00): The views and opinions expressed throughout the broadcast day on Redwood Community Radio are those of the speakers and not necessarily those of the station staff or underwriters. So have pity for us all, or I mean, have patience for us all and chime in with what you want to say. So thank you all so much for listening to us. It's time for Ask youk Herb Doctor.

**Speaker B** (01:28): Welcome to this month's ask your Reb. Dr. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Speaker C** (01:31): My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Speaker B** (01:33): Can we just get the mic turned up for me? Thank you. Okay, great. So welcome to KMed Gowanville 91.1 FM.

**Speaker D** (01:44): Hi.

**Speaker B** (01:44): It's the third Friday of the month and every third Friday of the month we run the program ask your herb doctor where we typically have Dr. Pete on the show, and he's become a stalwart here for the last, oh, gosh, 10 years or more for the last, oh, I don't know, five or six months, the COVID crisis has certainly been on the front burner. We've been discussing some of the facts surrounding the the do's and don'ts of protocols, the approach to it, what it means to the general population. And I guess there's been quite a bit of push and pull in terms of individuals comments about certain things like mask wearing, sanitization and the effectiveness of some of the strategies documented to be preventive and or compromising to our security or our individuality from a lockdown perspective. That's all a big economic bowl of wax. But anyway, so we're just going to this evening we're going to be outlining some of the therapeutic advances and some of the strategies to mitigate any potential coronavirus infection. Infection. So you're listening to RCRub, Dr. Gubb of Kmudgarville 91.1 FM. From 7:30 until the end of the show, you're invited to call in with any questions either surrounding tonight's subject of the strategies and herbs and other compounds used to mitigate the inflammation associated with severe infection. The number, if you live in the area or out of the area, it's a 707 number, so just dial 707-92-33911. So once again, we're very pleased, very proud to have Dr. Pete joining with us on the show to share his expertise and his wisdom. And let's just get straight into it. Are you there, Dr. Pete?

**Speaker D** (03:41): Yes. Hi.

**Speaker B** (03:42): Hi, Dr. Pete. Thanks so much for coming again. Appreciate your time. For those people, as always, who perhaps have never listened to you or have just heard you, for the first time, would you just outline your academic and professional background so people can get a feel for where you are and where you're coming from.

**Speaker D** (03:59): I studied and worked in the humanities for the first 10 years or so after college. Then I went back to school in biology for a PhD at University of Oregon, 1972, and since then have been working on that. The way the humanities culture in general interact with science, and that continues to be very interesting that science is heavily influenced by the general background culture. Television, newspapers as well as medical journals have a strong influence on the way science is practiced.

**Speaker B** (04:57): Yeah, for sure, it's a little bit of a exercise in, gosh, I want to say manipulation, but it always sounds so subversive to mention those kind of words like coercion or manipulation or. Yeah, control. But obviously the media, whether it's written media or spoken audio, visual media, a very powerful weapon in terms of shaping people's consciousness about certain subjects. And I know that is a pretty active exercise by some entities to use certain language to mold our beliefs around certain things. I know you've brought out many, many times about the dogmas or the repeated dogma and, or straight out lies through poor research that's continually propagated and fed into the mainstream and how people, you know, for the fish oil example, that, you know, for years and years and years, and it still is, I'm sure now that fish oil is still perceived as being helpful and there's overwhelming evidence to show that it's not the same really with sugar even, and salt. And we've mentioned those in previous broadcasts. So. Dr. P. I think what I wanted to do was run through some of the therapeutics and just wanted to kind of break them down in terms of their cellular activity and the mechanisms by which they are acting physiologically, because there's certainly quite a wide range of products that have the effects we're looking for. And I think the main thrust of what we're discussing is anti inflammatories, antihistamines, and the anti inflammatories working against the immune, modulated immune stimulated cytokines, et cetera, that are brought into play by viral attack and bacterial attack and, you know, platelet aggregation factors and other components of the immune system that kind of go awry when they meet invaders. So I think it's interesting to note though, and not downplaying it at all, because obviously if anybody's lost a loved one through Covid, it's extremely heartbreaking and it's a real, a real shame. But of the small percentage of the population that have been exposed to to the COVID 19 virus, an even smaller number have actually died from it. And in every case, it's the airways difficulty that's been the reason. Many first hand ER doctor reports mirrored the video report that we talked about in March and April of this year by Kyle Cameron Siddell, the ER doctor from Brooklyn, New York, who's treating critical care patients suffering from a cytokine storm. Inflammatory events of COVID infection in a small subset of patients focused on the damage induced by the ventilators themselves. And we mentioned the ventilator damage. The ventilators were used to perfuse the lungs of patients with low oxygen saturation who were being treated. And he said that the disease resembled way more high altitude sickness in its presentation, much more so than a viral pneumonia, which is what they thought they were treating initially.

**Speaker D** (07:58): That recognition leads to the iea, which is back by a lot of facts, that too much oxygen is creating the inflammation, making it worse instead and better.

**Speaker B** (08:12): Yeah, interesting. I know you've always said that the CO2 is a beneficial gas and that oxygen, really, as much as it's counterintuitive, should be considered more of a poison because.

**Speaker D** (08:22): And Kyle Seidel mentioned that his patients were very low in CO2, and that's exactly what happens in mountain sickness or in ventilation sickness. Too much oxygen lowers your CO2. That creates a very powerful systemic inflammatory condition.

**Speaker C** (08:45): So would it have been better if they gave them a proper mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen instead of just pure oxygen?

**Speaker D** (08:53): Yeah. And those products are available already mixed. 5% CO2 and 95% oxygen, or slightly varying percentages.

**Speaker C** (09:05): So if you were having difficulty breathing and you felt some relief from breathing in some passive oxygen, would you use that mixture of 95% oxygen, 5% CO2?

**Speaker D** (09:18): Definitely. Some of the mountain high altitude studies, they were putting people who were collapsing with mountain sickness, putting them in a big plastic or rubberized bag and zipping it shut, letting them breathe the relatively pure oxygen. And it was helping. But someone noticed that the plastic bag was accumulating a high level of CO2 by their breathing. And so they tried, instead of putting in an oxygen bag, giving them a CO2 supplement. And that worked very effectively and works in hospitals too, to ventilate people with a supplement of around 5% of CO2.

**Speaker B** (10:13): Okay, so looking then at inflammation, that seems to be the overriding mechanism of this form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, as it's known as. And it's the mucus buildup from the inflammation which I think is certainly something that needs addressing. And I think from the perspective of certain chemical compounds as well as some well known antihistamines from the herb world, these will be things that we want to discuss and let people know about that are freely available. None of these are prescriptions as far as I know, but the antihistamine, anti mucolytic type of benefit from some of these compounds is what I want to first explore with you. There are many, many compounds that have been discovered very early on in the treatment of respiratory disease. From the initial pneumonias that were very commonplace in the winters, especially in places like the north northern Europe. And then obviously with the emergence of things like TB and those other lung pathologies. Mucus was certainly well known as a compounding problem upon which a viral condition could become a bacterial secondary infection. And obviously with the mucus as a kind of breeding ground from bacterial infection and also reducing the capacity of oxygen diffusion, which I think is the important thing. And in terms of when patients are lying in a hospital situation with oxygen, whenever they've tried to withdraw the oxygen from these people. I know Kyle mentioned this, that they were extremely anxious and distressed when this happened, obviously because they're getting a feeling of total suffocation. That the mucus buildup in the lungs is something that if we can reduce this quite easily with herbs and other substances that work as agents to either break down the bonds between the mucus or cause an excessive watery secretion to thin the mucus. These are definitely strategies I know we learned when we were studying herbal medicine as a part and parcel of respiratory treatment of respiratory disease. So you had mentioned, and I found that this compound, bromhexene, actually comes from a ayurvedic plant named Adhota vasica. And so, Dr. Pete, do you know, do you know much more about Adhota's use and all the extract that they produce from it?

**Speaker D** (12:53): The bromhexene, it has been compared to with guaifenesin as mucolytic, and I think was about twice as effective at breaking down and thinning viscous mucus. And the mucus normally functions as a barrier against irritants and infective things. But when the inflammation of the tissue that's producing it becomes extreme, the osmolarity of the tissue increases and dehydrates and concentrates and makes the mucus much more viscous. One of the functions of the mucus, not only to bind toxins from the outside, but it binds and supposedly carries away things like histamine produced by the inflamed tissue. But if the inflammation leads to dehydrating the mucus, it becomes more and more dense, accumulates the histamine that should be lost to the environment and becomes itself a very powerful, not only irritant, but contraction promoting agent causing constriction of the small tubes of the breathing system. And that not only causes a mechanical barrier to breathing, but the stress and inflammation to the lungs acts systemically on the body because the lungs are for many chemicals, they rival the liver and the detoxifying system. And one of the side effects or effects of the coronavirus has been known for many years. But it has been reemphasized recently that the infected people tend to have a higher serotonin. The lungs are not detoxifying the serotonin that leads to clotting. So traditionally influenza was known to cause strokes and other blood clotting problems. That is currently being recognized. But that really largely derives from the fact that irritated lungs don't detoxify the histamine and serotonin and the serotonin activates the clotting system.

**Speaker B** (16:00): Interesting, because I'm going to get into some herbs in a minute that have a one of them platelet activation factor blocking agents. And so you mentioned the platelets in the clotting forms or the kind of sequelae of pneumonia or influenzal disease, clots are an issue. Then you mentioned there was stroke being one of them from blood clot.

**Speaker C** (16:23): So things like ginkgo and feverfew would all be paf, we call it blockers of paf. Platelet aggregation factor.

**Speaker B** (16:31): Yeah, potential. So in terms of those agents then that would have mucolytic. Here we talked about breaking, breaking the bonds between the bonds that make up the mucus themselves to lyse them and to make the mucus thinner by producing more watery secretions. And then the kind of mucocillary escalator, which is something I remember from those from videos as a small, small child at school watching the dangerous effects of smoking. And the mucociliary escalator was one of those things. They showed little hairs wafting from the lungs up and out through the trachea to wave foreign objects with dust or whatever, particles of bacteria and other other things that shouldn't be there up out of the airways. And so smoking was one of those things obviously that destroys those mucus, ciliary escalator hairs. So those things that improve either the breakdown of the mucus so it's not as tenacious and thick, or those things that cause a Reflex action in the gut. And we'll get onto that where the gut lung axis works so that things getting into the gut, stimulating the gut can actually have a reflex action on the lungs to produce an expectoration. They're called reflex expectorants. And then other agents that actually improve the mucociliary escalator. So I think I wanted to start with something that probably most people who at all interested in herbs have probably heard about has been, I think it's got a fairly good sales in the market is quercetin. Are you familiar with quercetin at all?

**Speaker D** (18:15): Oh yeah. That's one of the reasons I recommend fruits, especially citrus fruit. All right. And it works with the sugar content of fruits as well as other anti inflammatory things. Sugar itself can be eucolytic.

**Speaker B** (18:36): Okay. Because the sugar itself then will it have any kind of osmotic effect or.

**Speaker D** (18:42): That anti inflammatory, just anti inflammatory. It quiets the inflammation in a variety of ways, lowers the stress hormones.

**Speaker C** (18:53): And isn't that how cortisol shots work when you have lung disease and they're giving people cortisone?

**Speaker D** (18:58): Yeah, it raises your serum glucose.

**Speaker B** (19:03): All right, so quercetin then is a compound, as you mentioned, found in fruits, especially citrus fruits. And there are other things that I more associate with the anthocyanins and the pigments in dark berries, but lots of dark berries are implicated to have fairly high levels of quercetin and things from blackberries and blueberries and bilberries, fairly high in quercetin. And then we also mentioned ginkgo which has a platelet aggregation factor blocking compound.

**Speaker C** (19:37): Well, you forgot, did you forget nettle? Nettle leaf is very high in quercetin.

**Speaker B** (19:41): I know we're just going through the berries, but yeah, nettle leaf obviously is one of those things. And again, nettle leaf has been used in allergy and. Allergy and histamine and that. We'll get onto that in a little bit because another tack of approaching the inflammatory pathway and calming it is an antihistamine approach. So you're listening to Ask your abdoctor, kmed garbival 91.1 FM from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's discussion on the anti inflammatory agents that can be used to suppress inflammation. The main driving force of the real problems with people that contract Covid and get into respiratory difficulty. The number is 707-923-3911. So from 7:30 till the end of the show, Dr. Pete will be there and available to answer questions and. Or if other questions need to be asked that are outside of tonight's scope, that's probably fine too. So getting on to expectorants then, as a method by which respiratory disease period can be approached, whether it's bacterial or viral, it doesn't really matter. Or indeed if it's an allergic type of response that expectorants are things that, as we've mentioned, either cause the increase of thin watery production in the cells, the mucus cells in the lungs to raise this kind of liquid level to be wafted up by the mucociliary escalator up and out of the trachea. So it can be relieved that the kind of diffusion can happen more easily in the lungs between CO2 and oxygen. And I wanted to mention elecampane. Now, elecampane is a fairly tall perennial herb. It's in the compositae and contains a volatile oil and a fixed oil. And it's long been used as what they call a warming expectorant. And it's actually part of our formula, our new formula. I'm not trying to sell anything here, but it's actually within our time. Di Christian Ali campaign syrup. And that brings me to licorice. Now, licorice is one of those herbs that I've read quite a lot of PubMed articles and other articles online that are by the thousands now concerning Covid and whether it's Chinese medicinal herbs or it's Native American herbs or ayurvedic herbs or, you know, just looking at the medicinal herb arsenal in general. There's lots of published research now and. And licorice comes up time and time again. We've always used, well, not always used, but licorice. I look at licorice mainly for things like gastric ulcers as a good soothing kind of demulcent. But licorice actually has quite a bit of antiviral activity and they'd never really think about licorice as an antiviral. Most of the research that's done on it has looked at things like the compounds called glycyrrhizin and glycyuretic acid. And glycyrrhizin itself as a compound breaks down into glycyrtenic acid in the digestive tract. And both glycyrrhizin and glycyrtenic acid exhibit a mineralocorticoid aldosterone like action on the body. And I wanted to ask you, Dr. Peter, if you could Just go through this. I know we have a couple of callers on the line. Hopefully they can sit tight for a few minutes here before we get to the 7:30. But Dr. P, I'd like you because I know you've got this, you have this very, I won't say simplified because it's not at all simple, but a very simplistic mechanism by which people that are listening can understand the, I call it in controversy really because as practitioners of herbal medicine we were always anti steroids, okay? I mean people came to see us with eczema or psoriasis and they'd been on steroids, they were either no longer getting response from it or the, you know, that they've been on steroids for so long they were getting other problems, whether it be asthma or other situations revolving around a kind of immune dysregulation. But I saw this, and I know you've mentioned this before, the Framingham study, but this may be a different frame Framingham study showing that elevated aldosterone was positively associated with the incidence of new onset hypertension or high blood pressure, which is something that we were taught about for some individuals using licorice in large quantities. So how do you see the line as it were, distinguishing the positive steroidal effects from the negative effects?

**Speaker D** (24:29): The tissues that are most involved in inflammation happen to have taste receptors and bitter herbs and sweet things like licorice have signaling effects to activate some of the anti inflammatory mechanisms. I think that's how licorice, among other herbs can act on our system to inhibit histamine and serotonin for example, but in large amounts that increase the tendency towards hypertension. The steroid is inhibiting an enzyme that prevents the accumulation of too much mineral corticoid such as aldosterone. And aldosterone itself is a major promoter of degenerative inflammation. So that's one of the reasons that I think progesterone is a better anti inflammatory, except maybe for one or two days of acute lung inflammation. Dexamethasone is probably a quicker acting thing. But for prolonged use, progesterone is not only supporting the cortisol like anti inflammatory effect, but it has a powerful anti aldosterone effect, preventing the increase of blood pressure from excessive accumulation of sodium and blocking all of those inflammatory degenerative fibrosis producing effects of aldosterone.

**Speaker C** (26:42): So I think it's something like licorice. The thyme and licorice syrup that we just produced is not something we'd want people to be on at very high doses. For a long period of time, but in an acute situation for a short period of time to get over your chest infection. You're saying that that amount of licorice in there is anti inflammatory enough to help, which is what we obviously see with our clients.

**Speaker D** (27:05): Yeah, I think one of the effects of just sugary things like orange juice is that it too activates those sugar taste receptors. It isn't sugar in licorice, but it is something that activates the sweet sensors.

**Speaker C** (27:28): Yes.

**Speaker B** (27:30): Okay, I guess we'll hold it there.

**Speaker C** (27:31): 1 that's why the children like it so much.

**Speaker B** (27:34): I'm going to ask you another question about dexamethasone and the steroidal anti inflammatories from a sugar perspective after the calls. But let me try to remember that as we take these first couple of callers and see where we're going with this. Caller. You're on the air. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Speaker E** (27:50): I believe in the herbs and I've been studying in myself, you know, as I come to the other environments in medicine that's more white lab medicines that a few of them don't work in my system because I know more about the herbs, what they can do. And in this pandemic with this inflammation that I found golden steel echinacea golden steel, a thousand milligrams and you can buy that through computer. But I found the best anti inflammatory after diclofenac potassium and I've been using Kinesia golden steel for many different reasons in my life in past years when I was in school, in college in San Francisco, the bad weather, a lot of iron and I start using echinacea in Golden Seal so I can be up in the morning with energy real early to be 6am in nap class.

**Speaker C** (29:11): Yes, Goldenseal is very, very good to help with the mucus production of your mucous membranes. Helps regulate normal mucus production and echinacea is also very anti inflammatory for the immune system.

**Speaker B** (29:24): Okay, well let's take this next caller and see where we're going with this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Speaker F** (29:31): Hi, I'm from Fort Bragg and I know some of my friends are listening to me and I hope my oldest son isn't because I don't think he realizes the health problems that I'm incurring now because I used to be called the bungling Prague private eye, I did help law enforcement when I could and I also was almost murdered three Times my nose has been broken five times, two times by me by accident when I was working and three times I can't even begin to tell you, oh, wow, now I've got a big polyp in my right nostril and my sinuses from. From moving into an apartment seven years ago. They are so infected all the way up into my head that I get headaches. And all this stuff comes out. This is gross over the phone to tell you, but it comes out in like ropes, rings of mucus stuff. And sometimes it's colored like cream and white or cream and clear.

**Speaker C** (30:40): Goldenseal would be very good for you. Goldenseal is a great.

**Speaker F** (30:43): I've been doing that, but I can't take licorice. I've got fibromyalgia also that and the carpet where I'm at is 33 years old. It's got mold and bacteria in it. And I was told that I've got pandemic sinusitis along with my fibromyalgia.

**Speaker C** (31:01): And the.

**Speaker F** (31:06): C1, C2 in my neck, L4, L5 and S1 in my low back and one disc in the middle of my back in degenerative disc disease. I don't know what to do for all this, but mostly my sinuses, they've got me on pregab pregabalin for Lyrica, you know, instead of Lyrica because that was so expensive.

**Speaker B** (31:30): All right, I want to try and keep on, keep on focus here with your question, ma', am, and understand that probably a sinus infection type issue is your most important thing. So for this, for those things, for sinus infections, we've definitely had some very, very good feedback over the time we've been using. It is a formula that we produce which is based on well known sinus herbs. Obviously the main one, goldenseal. Horseradish root is another excellent compound for disinfecting nasal passages.

**Speaker C** (32:02): And the sinuses also has chili in it and plantain. Those are both mucolytics like we were talking about that they help dissolve mucus and then the secretions and disinfect them.

**Speaker B** (32:16): So there's quite a. Quite a wide range of herbs that are used basically be either antibacterial or mucolytic. And so I would definitely give some of those a try. I wanted to get fairly quickly in a bit here to mention onions, onion syrup. It's actually a very, very simple remedy and you can try that at home without buying any of our products, you know, so you just get an onion and cut it into 8th of an inch or thereabouts slices and then set them on a saucer and basically cover the onions with honey and just let the honey pull out by diffuse osmotic kind of pull and pull out the actives within the onion, which are more of a kind of soft sulfur containing products like horseradish, and take that internally. And obviously it's metabolized, but it's excreted through the respiratory tract. So that will have an effect on your sinuses. I would definitely give that a go. And then also fresh horseradish is a very good alternative. So let's get to these next callers that we've got on the air. Caller, you're on the air. What's your question?

**Speaker G** (33:22): Away from Hello, I'm Andrew, Ray and Sarah. My name is Ali. I am from I just wanted to ask Dr. Pete about the amazing facelift effect that he got from pregnenola. So I'm only in my 20s, but I'm aging prematurely for the past few years. I haven't really figured out why and the doctors don't know either, but it, the difference is very shocking. And anyway, I'm trying to find a way to reverse this and what's not normal, again, like a young female. And so I'm just wondering if the facelift effect is a common occurrence with pregnenolone. And also is there a way to determine the safety of pregnenolone? Because I am afraid to try it because I've heard other reports of women who've taken it and they said that they've developed like facial hair and stuff.

**Speaker D** (34:17): Dr. P, did you have what was the last phase? They developed facial hair.

**Speaker C** (34:21): They developed facial hair. Oh, which I don't think is possible.

**Speaker D** (34:26): Well, yes, it's very impure. In recent years, I've been hearing all kinds of symptoms associated with using. I think it's mostly from new small Chinese factories that don't know how to purify it. And they're getting symptoms like breast pain, uterine contractions, showing an estrogen like effect as well as possibly the androgen like effect. But pregnenolone, when it's pure doesn't. If a person is healthy, they can take a cupful of it with no noticeable effect. All it does is lower the stress hormones. So until you're about 45 years old, you usually don't feel anything from pure pregnenolin. So all of these symptoms that are being talked about on the Internet I think are evidence that there's a lot of very impure pregnenolin going around.

**Speaker G** (35:39): Okay, thank you. And then is there a way to determine if pregnenolin is safe? Like, should I just get the batch tested?

**Speaker D** (35:46): It costs thousands of dollars to have a good test.

**Speaker B** (35:54): Well, you can. I do fairly regularly send off pregnenolone to be assayed by gas chromatography. So there's a lab up in Washington, there's quite a few. All you got to do is Google them. But the test is about $250.

**Speaker C** (36:12): Dr. Pete, are you aware of a brand that you feel is fairly pure?

**Speaker D** (36:17): No, not for 20 years.

**Speaker B** (36:21): I wonder, out of interest, Dr. Pete, just to mention this, like I said, I've had several batches here in the last two years at least tested by gas chromatography, and it's come back as a 99.9% pure pregnenolone. Do you think when this is put into a chromatograph and goes through an atomic absorption spectrum calibrated machine, that should give you a peak? If there is a peak, and then that defines whether or not it's pure. Do you think there's any other?

**Speaker D** (36:52): Well, they should look for a very small peak for estrogen or other steroids because one part per thousand, if it's estrogen, can have very powerful effects. If you're taking tens of milligrams of pregnenolone and 1000th of that is estrogen, that's a powerful dose.

**Speaker C** (37:21): So in general, this caller is asking about the facelift effect from taking pregnenolone. And she's in her 20s. What sort of dose would you think would be a safe dose to try if she feels like she has a pure product?

**Speaker D** (37:35): Oh, it's safe in any amount. It was tested on rats in the early 1950s, and the equivalent of a cupful at a time had no effects at all for a year. I took three or four thousand milligrams every day just to test whether there were any side effects. And many people in their 20s and 30s wanted to try it. And even with a heaping spoonful, none of them could feel the slightest effect. But people in their late 40s and 50s, those are the ones who experience an overnight tightening up of their loose skin, especially on their throat and over their eyes.

**Speaker C** (38:29): So do you think that would be something that this 20 year old would benefit from?

**Speaker D** (38:34): No, at that age, very, very unlikely.

**Speaker G** (38:39): So I will say that I've taken pregnenolone before, like years ago, because I've been following you for a while. But I took it and I, I think I took maybe 50 milligrams and it made me very sleepy after and I took a nap. I don't know if that's a coincidence or anything, but.

**Speaker D** (39:00): It does lower cortisol if that is abnormally high.

**Speaker G** (39:07): Okay, interesting. All right, well thank you for all this information, all of you and thank you for the show.

**Speaker C** (39:15): Thank you for your call.

**Speaker B** (39:17): Okay, let's take this, let's take this next call. A caller you're on the airway from and what's your question?

**Speaker D** (39:24): Calling from Portland.

**Speaker H** (39:26): And my question is does chamomile tea reduce estrogen?

**Speaker B** (39:31): Chamomile tea reducing estrogen? Well, its main use is a gut anti inflammatory so but it does have epigenin. Yeah. Nurse of the Gut is and apigenin.

**Speaker C** (39:41): Is a known estrogen counter antagonist. Right? Dr. Pete Right.

**Speaker B** (39:51): Yeah.

**Speaker C** (39:51): So potentially yes, it could be an estrogen lowering sedative, gastrointestinal calming herb.

**Speaker D** (39:59): Yeah. Anything that makes your intestine happy is likely to reduce estrogen effect. Effect. Would there be other herbal teas that would have that effect? What kind of tea?

**Speaker C** (40:12): Other herb teas?

**Speaker D** (40:15): Oh, I think aspirin is the most practical general aromatase inhibitor.

**Speaker B** (40:22): Yeah. Liver stimulants would certainly speed up liver clearance and or bowel things like cascara would certainly prevent reuptake and reabsorption of bowel estrogen. Those are things to consider if you're, if you're considering any estrogen load you want to get rid of, then obviously excretory pathways, if you can speed up the excretory pathways, that will be certainly helpful. But there are other estrogen blocking agents.

**Speaker C** (40:49): That are probably lemon balm because it's also the essential oil and lemon balm is very calming on the gastrointestinal tract that might indirectly lower estrogen.

**Speaker B** (40:59): Okay. You're listening to ask Europe. Dr. Kmidigalbapul 91.1 FM. From now until the end of the show at 8 o', clock, you're invited to call in with questions. And the number here is 707-923-3911. So once again, 707-923-391100. So we're just going through some medicinal herbs and other compounds that would be useful if anybody does contract Covid and.

**Speaker C** (41:25): Or any other flus that might be.

**Speaker B** (41:27): Circulating around as well, or influenza or colds. I just want to say at this point in time, I know it's not indicative of the general population of the United States of America, but I only know one person in this eight months and I didn't only found out about this person 2 weeks ago who actually has contracted Covid and I think they're getting over it pretty well. And it was actually their son who came up from a meeting with other people in Southern California, a 19 or 20 year old son who actually contracted it and he basically went and got tested, he tested positive and I'm not downplaying COVID 19 for one minute, but he had a day or so of feeling uncomfortable and he was back to normal. But so yeah, I've just started to. I've always said at the beginning of this quote unquote pandemic that where are they? I know we see them on TV and I know they talk about mass, mass hospitalizations and we've seen it all over Europe and I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's taken a long time to come across anybody and I think there's just 2 million people so far that have contracted it, a proper.

**Speaker D** (42:30): Diagnosis, had problems with it. I should say, should look for other causes of the symptoms. In some cases they're saying that if you have a positive test for the virus, which in most people isn't associated with symptoms, but if you have one symptom in association with a positive test, they're putting that down as a verified case of COVID 19 infection. But you don't know that unless you get tested, test to see if they also had influenza or a thousand other agents that could cause that one symptom.

**Speaker C** (43:17): And then of course there's people that have Covid and test negative or people that test positive and don't have it because the tests are unreliable at this stage as well.

**Speaker B** (43:27): There's, there's a wealth, it's a huge pool. Some of it's politicized, some of it's. Yeah, can't go there. I guess it's just too much. I just wanted to make sure that we do get out some of those herbal strategies for combating influenza and or Covid. I know the phone suddenly started going crazy there and I think what we're going to get into perhaps in the next few calls is Covid related in terms of actualities. But I wanted to mention astragalus before we take the first of two callers here because astragalus, another Chinese herb, but we use a lot of astragalus and they know that from doing studies in China especially that it decreases the inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis, alpha interleukin 8 and it increases the level of anti inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 10. So therefore it has this anti inflammatory activity, one of those herbs that they've definitely used in traditional Chinese medicine as part and parcel of a formula for treating Covid. So anyway, I guess let's take these next two callers. Caller, you're on the airway from. And what's your question?

**Speaker H** (44:34): Yeah, hi.

**Speaker D** (44:34): Hello.

**Speaker C** (44:35): Hello, you're on the air.

**Speaker H** (44:37): Yeah, Hi, Sarah, Andrew. Dr. Pete, of course. I have so many questions. I'll ask that two important questions. One would be, the first one would be what does Dr. Pete recommend for somebody who's had cancer in the past, kidney cancer had surgically removed. What kind of diet does he recommend for somebody that, you know, has recovered from that?

**Speaker B** (45:01): Yeah. And what was your other question, sir?

**Speaker H** (45:03): And the other question was about the eucalyptus humidifier. My son's had a few, you know, cold or flus in the past and we always put the eucalyptus humidifier and it's really helped. So I just wanted to get your feedback.

**Speaker B** (45:18): Yeah, let's start with the kidney cancer and the diet. Dr. Pete, what would you suggest if a person's had kidney cancer been treated, do you think from a dietary perspective that be some foods that would be potentially less of a renal load or if that's what you're even thinking about.

**Speaker D** (45:38): Watching for intestinal inflammatory symptoms? Because there are a lot of toxins that damage the kidneys that are formed only in the intestine. And so keeping a clean intestine is the first requirement. Keeping your energy up in general is essential for the immune system to work both in the sense of preventing inflammation and also resisting infection. And that keeping your energy up involves keeping your daytime temperature up to what used to be the average normal in recent decades, the national average temperature is decreasing. But what used to be the normal 37 Celsius or 98.6 Fahrenheit, that temperature is very important both for preventing inflammation and for increasing resistance to cancer and other degenerative diseases and to infections.

**Speaker H** (47:03): So my mother having like one kidney left, so that means she shouldn't when it comes to digestion. So saturated fats should be like in small amounts, like, you know, the ruminescent cuts you recommend, like even that type of food could be irritating for her. So she just like stick more with, you know, fruit and you know, like what kind? Like do you recommend the meats when she has like one candy left or like what do you recommend then?

**Speaker D** (47:32): One of our natural hormones which is very involved in kidney malfunction is parathyroid hormone and that lowers our systemic energy production and so it damages Our immune system, if that's elevated. And the two things that will prevent excess production of parathyroid hormone are a lot of calcium in the diet relative to phosphate and an adequate intake of vitamin D. Those are both anti inflammatory and anti infective agents and protects against cancer.

**Speaker H** (48:19): So the milk is okay for her just having one kidney, that wouldn't be too harsh on her?

**Speaker D** (48:24): No, I think it's the safest thing. Very milk rich diet, going relatively light on phosphate rich foods like meat and.

**Speaker C** (48:37): Beans are phosphate rich foods, right?

**Speaker H** (48:40): Yeah, I recall. So, yeah, the meat is high. Even if you do them on soups like once a week, maybe that's still kind of high.

**Speaker D** (48:49): No, you need a certain amount of iron in your diet. And so eggs are a good regular source of, of iron that have a moderate amount of phosphate.

**Speaker B** (49:05): I wanted to, I wanted to move on to your question and I was.

**Speaker H** (49:09): Like, you can't eat chicken.

**Speaker B** (49:10): I wanted to move on to your question about eucalyptus just for the. Because we do have other callers on the line, I want to make sure they all get a chance to ask the question.

**Speaker C** (49:18): So a milk dairy rich diet with a low meat diet is probably going to be the safest for your mother's kidney.

**Speaker D** (49:27): And keeping the vitamin D intake, keeping.

**Speaker C** (49:30): The vitamin D up, keeping our bowels moving.

**Speaker I** (49:32): Is the supplement still safe?

**Speaker H** (49:33): Like, because I've heard that mixed reviews. That's not good to take D3. It's always better to just, you know, get the sunlight and try to, you know, stay as natural as possible.

**Speaker D** (49:43): Yeah. When you have good sun availability.

**Speaker C** (49:47): Well, if you live closer to the equator as well.

**Speaker B** (49:49): So so far as humidification and the volatile essential oils. Dr. Pete. So obviously the person's using a humidifier if somebody's got dry airways and, or using volatile oils in them like eucalyptus. From my perspective, I think that's totally, totally a good thing to do. I know these volatile oils certainly as well as the humidity for soothing some dry airways. Certainly has antibacterial effects, none of which are poorly written about. They're extensively written about. So most of those volatile oils contain terpenes, monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, and they've all got lots of interesting activity from antibacterial, antiviral, many, many different papers written on it. And Gerard Depardieu and others in France have written fairly extensively on it.

**Speaker C** (50:44): And eucalyptus radiata is one of the nicest smell and eucalyptus essential oils to use in a humidifier like that and something California.

**Speaker H** (50:52): Sorry to interrupt, but when, when We. When you take the herbs, right, that you guys recommend, is this something that we have to wait for symptoms or let. Somebody could just, you know, kind of take them every other day or like, how. How do you recommend the doses?

**Speaker B** (51:07): I think it's like anything else. If you've got a good diet, that's basically the seat. That's the seat of your good health. And if you incorporate things into your diet which are also beneficial from a nutritive perspective, that's the start of it. I would say, definitely from personal experience, if, you know, let's talk about colds and coughs and influenzas and that kind of stuff. If, you know, it's going around. I'm talking about COVID but I'm talking about, you know, it could be Covid.

**Speaker C** (51:31): It could be any colds and coughs.

**Speaker B** (51:33): Your family had a coronavirus incident and, you know, your grandmother or whatever, and you've been around them, but you don't have any symptoms.

**Speaker C** (51:40): Start using echinacea, our echinacea elderberry syrup we designed specifically for that because it has only the echinacea root and the elderberry to really help boost your immune system. If, you know you're going to be around someone who's sick. I mean, that's how you're supposed to use echinacea. You can also use it afterwards, once you do actually get sick. But they're very effective in the early stages before your body's come down with.

**Speaker B** (52:06): It, because it takes about 48 hours to transcribe those factors that are responsible for.

**Speaker H** (52:11): If I could squeeze a quick question for Dr. Pete. When a woman starts.

**Speaker B** (52:16): I don't think you can.

**Speaker H** (52:18): Her symptoms start.

**Speaker B** (52:19): Okay, I'm sorry about that, but we've got somebody else who's been on the air for a while here, so let's take this next call. A caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

**Speaker F** (52:29): Am I on?

**Speaker B** (52:30): Yeah, you're on. Go ahead.

**Speaker I** (52:30): Okay. My name is Lily Macy. I'm in the Edwardsburg area, and my husband has developed since last January quite a bit of hyper mucusness. I mean, he's got so much mucus that at night he just acts like he's drowning in it, and I keep him kind of up. But I'm wondering if there's an herb maybe like fenugreek or anything, any kind of herb that could help to dry up that.

**Speaker B** (52:59): Sure. Well, first of all. Yeah, first of all, is it infected or is it.

**Speaker I** (53:03): No, it's not infected. He did have pneumonia last January. And the doctor put him. He said he's got this hypermucous situation going. So he put him on Mucinex, which is an over the counter. But he's not infected. He doesn't have any sign of infection. It's just this. It's like he's drowning in mucus all the time and he clears his throat.

**Speaker D** (53:27): And has he used an antihistamine?

**Speaker I** (53:32): Has he used an antihistamine? I gave him something. Well, isn't that what Mucinex is? Isn't that an antihistamine?

**Speaker C** (53:41): No, I think that's just a mucolytic. So antihistamines, like in terms of an antihistamine, like Benadryl or diphenhydramine.

**Speaker I** (53:52): He'S really quite, quite old. And he just did not respond well to the Benadryl.

**Speaker C** (54:00): Okay, so has he tried the mucolytic herbs like plantain, goldenseal?

**Speaker I** (54:07): Not plantain, but we have tried goldenseal, but we'll try that again. What do you think of fenugreek?

**Speaker B** (54:15): I don't have any experience or use of fenugreek in terms of drying up.

**Speaker C** (54:19): Mucus more for digestion, calming the digestion, and also increasing breast milk production.

**Speaker B** (54:24): Yeah, the galaxy is one of the main things.

**Speaker I** (54:27): So plantain and fenugreek to dry up. That's all I'm trying to do is.

**Speaker B** (54:30): Get him so that he can sleep.

**Speaker I** (54:32): Comfortably without constantly clearing his throat.

**Speaker C** (54:35): Well, another thing is cascara to keep his bowels moving really well.

**Speaker I** (54:40): Believe me, they move. He's fine with that.

**Speaker C** (54:43): Dr. Pete, do you have any other ideas to help dry up the mucus?

**Speaker D** (54:47): Yeah, some of the mild antiseptic fibrous foods such as raw carrot or cooked mushrooms or cooked bamboo shoots.

**Speaker I** (55:00): He gets that kind of food. We've been vegan 14 years, so he gets a lot of raw and cooked vegetables every day.

**Speaker C** (55:09): Well, but specifically raw carrot can actually decrease a lot of mucus production if he has about a cup of raw carrot salad a day.

**Speaker D** (55:17): And raw lettuce is one of the most promoting mucus inflammatory agents.

**Speaker I** (55:26): Raw carrot, like grated carrot?

**Speaker C** (55:28): Yeah, like grated carrot. But don't use any lettuce with it.

**Speaker A** (55:31): Okay.

**Speaker I** (55:31): Just straight grated carrots.

**Speaker C** (55:32): Straight grated carrot or really, really well cooked mushrooms are another fiber that inhibits microorganisms and inflammation in the intestine. So then it can therefore help with the inflammation from the mucus, the inflammation producing the mucus.

**Speaker B** (55:49): Okay, we better call that it for the evening system.

**Speaker C** (55:53): Thank you so much.

**Speaker B** (55:53): Thank you. For your call. Okay, so Dr. Pete, thank you so much for your time. I'll spend a couple of minutes just getting people information to you and a bit more information.

**Speaker C** (56:02): Did you have anything else to finish up with? Dr. Pete, thank you so much.

**Speaker B** (56:07): Thanks so much for your time.

**Speaker D** (56:08): Thank you.

**Speaker B** (56:09): Okay, so for those people who've listened, we do the shows every third Friday the month. What I did want to mention very quickly before the last few minutes that we have, first things first. Dr. Pete's website, which is raypeat.com has got fully referenced articles surrounding a wide variety of conditions that are treated naturally, scientifically with documented case reports, et cetera and or verified references. So go take a look at his website. Our website is westernbotanicalmedicine.com I wanted to mention those other few things that I never got around to talking about for treating excessive mucus and or for improving the ciliary escalator. I mentioned onion syrup for that lady. And then the other syrup which we don't really see too much of it here in America is colch ther and coltsfoot flowers. Same thing using coltsfoot flowers. I know probably places like Mountain Rose Herbs still sell them but in England they're still pretty popular because I think Albania is one of the main countries they're coming out of right now. But I'm making a syrup from coltsfoot flowers and then marshmallow leaf just working as a reflex demulcent in the gut to stimulate respiratory demulcent and thin watery secretions so people can cough up mucus. I wanted to mention frankincense. Obviously everyone knows frankincense for obvious reasons. Boswellic acid is a substance there which is responsible for the anti inflammatory effect via the enzyme 5 lipoxygenase. And I didn't get a chance to ask Dr. Pete about this but basically promotes the formation of leukotrienes. And these are an important group of inflammatory mediators in the body. But boswellic acid actually binds and structurally changes in the active site of 5 leaves epoxygenase and also inhibits this enzyme instead of catalyzing its synthesis into pro inflammatory leukotrienes.5 Lipoxygenase produces anti inflammatory substances by initiating this change under the influence of boswellic acid. So simply put, frankincense in its own right can change the inflammatory enzyme into an anti inflammatory enzyme. So it's another good thing to remember about frankincense and then wode wode root. I know the Chinese use wode root and in England it's pretty famous from the ancient Picts and Celts. But the root of woad, which is is tinctoria, definitely used has that antibiotic and antiviral activity, inhibits the hemagglutinins in the blood and inhibits the viral neuraminidase, amongst other activities. So two other potential antivirals. And then obviously we didn't get around to mentioning aspirin, but aspirin, definite, very, very inexpensive, very easy to get anti inflammatory antiviral. Plenty of evidence showing it's inhibiting viral replication. It's got an antiplatelet activity, obviously, and works definitely in acute lung injury. One of those things to remember. So until we are on the show in December, third Friday of December, thank you for your time and those people that called in. Thank you.

**Speaker C** (59:13): My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you very much for listening.

**Speaker B** (59:16): My name's Andrew Murray.
