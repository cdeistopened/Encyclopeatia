## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Thank you very much for joining me and us this afternoon. You have a degree in biology with a specialty in physiology. Do you want to add anything to that besides being a science historian?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, except maybe that I was in the humanities for years before I went to graduate school in biology.

**John Barkhausen:** That is an interesting part of your life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it guided the way I treated science, being more critical about the texts that you refer to.

**John Barkhausen:** And maybe giving you a more humanistic attitude toward science and life.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. More philosophy. Biologists think they have a philosophy of science, but it's pretty rudimentary—mechanistic, mechanical materialism, usually.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you want to define mechanical materialism for our audience who may not be familiar with that term?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the difference between organismic thinking—in the Whiteheadian sense—or historical materialism in the Marxist sense. Mechanistic materialism makes a clear distinction between mind and matter. For them, matter is necessarily unconscious and stupid because intelligence exists only in their realm of mind or idealist philosophy.

**John Barkhausen:** I see. So it's sort of an elitism of human thought at the expense of the rest of the world.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, a clear distinction between mind and matter. In brain biology, that is changing a lot. People are realizing that you can't solve some of the problems when you think in that dualistic way. But still, it tends to be a philosophical idealism rather than a philosophical materialism.

## Indicators of Health and History

**John Barkhausen:** I'd like to bring the show down to earth so people can relate to it. I was thinking of talking today about how we know whether we're healthy or not. I think one of the ways we judge ourselves is how healthy we feel—if we feel energized, depressed, stimulated, or stressed out. When the medical world came into being, we used professionals to judge how healthy we are. I thought it would be interesting to talk about the history of that. Perhaps you could give us your experience from childhood on regarding the health challenges you faced and how that shaped your viewpoint.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As a little kid, I was a migrainer, periodically having combination digestive and visually affected headaches. When I was ten, a naturopathic doctor prescribed a bag of an herb to make a tea out of that was supposed to affect the migraine syndrome. Years later, I discovered from the taste that it had been marijuana, but it didn't help at all. That was about the extent of my drug treatment.

**John Barkhausen:** What year was that? I didn't know there were naturopaths back then.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 1945. Oh, sure. They were the original doctors. The modern type of allopathic doctor was just one strand, one ideology of medicine. There were all kinds of ideologies up until the American Medical Association defined one strand of medicine.

**John Barkhausen:** How did osteopathy relate to that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was just one of the theories that the bones were the framework of health. Many strands emphasized different things. The old humor theory of medicine pretty well died out, but those things were blended into homeopathic medicine and naturopathy. The homeopathic tradition still has some of that thinking in terms of personality types—the phlegmatic and sanguine personalities—thinking in terms of the fluid related to the various organs. When you look at standard medical traditions between France and England, you see a very heavy emphasis in the Latin cultures on the liver and the English on the intestine. In Latin America, cardiology is a much bigger thing than in Europe.

**John Barkhausen:** How do you account for the emphasis on different organs from the different cultures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's just which school of medicine happened to be most influential or successful.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think the humors were influenced by the Indian and Far Eastern traditions like the Ayurvedic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there was some absorption. The Arabs really were the way Greek medicine came into Europe, but some of the Indian culture got into the Greek medical tradition.

## Historical Diagnosis Methods

**John Barkhausen:** Before modern blood tests, how did doctors assess whether a person was healthy or not?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depended a lot on the school of medicine. Some would make judgments about which humor was dominating them or which organ. By the 19th century, different strands of biological information were being integrated into the different theories so that people started thinking about the cells making up the organs. Late in the 19th century, they were realizing that sugar was secreted by the liver to maintain a steady internal environment.

They used feel and smell and even taste—the different secretions and warmth on the body. They would examine the person as an object to see if there was anything abnormal. For example, they used to taste the urine to see if a person was diabetic. There were many ideas about what you could diagnose by smell, including diabetes and cancer. Lately, people have been talking about the ability of dogs to diagnose by smell when a person is about to have a seizure or developing a cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that their heightened smell or is it telepathic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Possibly electrical fields. Dogs can apparently detect bioelectric fields the way fish can. But Linus Pauling was probably the first person who thought of diagnosing by analyzing a person's breath and found 250 chemicals in the breath. Only a few places are now taking advantage of that. For example, nitric oxide is increased in the breath when a person has an inflammatory disease.

**John Barkhausen:** So basically they used all their senses to diagnose people.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, as well as listening to their complaints and their history. The person often knows more about their disease than they are aware. For example, their dreams will often predict some sickness that's about to come to full awareness. If a person is a good listener, sometimes they can draw out information that the person wasn't fully aware of.

## Caller: Matter and Intelligence

**Bill (Caller):** I was fascinated with the opening about you advocating for matter to have the same kind of intelligence as the human species. Isn't it interesting that we are willing to attribute intelligence to non-material beings like spirits, but not to matter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the attitude towards matter that exists throughout the medical profession and biology in general is basically a religious belief. It is a religious exclusion of spirit, mind, and intelligence from whatever they consider matter. So an organ or a material object can't have in itself mentality, spirit, or intelligence, and hardly deserves to be called alive. It's not at all a scientific issue.

When I was about eight or nine years old, I read about J.C. Bose's biological experiments right around the turn of the last century. Coming from the Hindu tradition, he didn't have the Christian/Jewish/Muslim attitude towards matter, life, and human intelligence. His background gave him the perspective to ask what lifelike properties exist in the different levels of organization.

Bose asked, "What are the defining features of human life?" He listed properties of sensitivity and reactivity, then did tests on plants to see if they had any of these animal-like properties. He showed that plants showed a reactive physical response to practically any stimulation. After designing instruments that would record the reactions of plant tissue, he applied the same thing to objects such as metal and minerals and showed the same properties of sensitivity, reaction, learning, or adaptation applied to all levels of existence—mineral, plant, animal, as well as human. That didn't fit into the way Western nerve biology was developing, but scientifically it was actually more soundly based.

**John Barkhausen:** And we can thank Bose for inventing the radio? Marconi got his basic ideas from Bose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It was exactly the same kind of physical thinking about the sensitivity of material that led to the invention of the radio as to the explanation of nerve and muscle function.

## Medical Trauma and Radiation

**John Barkhausen:** Was the naturopath your only experience with a doctor as a child?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh no, I had one doctor give me probably almost a lethal dose of radiation by fluoroscoping me.

**John Barkhausen:** How old were you then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Five, I think.

**John Barkhausen:** Was there any purpose given?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Entertaining the doctor and impressing the patients. That was a very popular toy around 1940.

**John Barkhausen:** I didn't realize you'd been subjected to that. I think Thomas Edison was completely against the use of radioactive technology, wasn't he?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, he was one of the pioneers in designing the apparatus, but his main technician died horribly from exposure to it. That changed Edison's attitude.

**John Barkhausen:** When did you realize it wasn't a good idea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1945 and '46, I started reading about radiation because of the atomic bomb. It was already in the underground culture that the biological effects of medical X-rays were unwise, but the medical profession was hardly getting started. They had killed many people with bad apparatus and theories in the 1930s. People I knew in college were still getting horrible X-ray treatment for acne or ringworm. About ten years after the treatment, some of their skulls had begun collapsing; their sinuses collapsed so their faces were deformed. That was still being done in the 1950s.

I remember hearing about the English woman, Alice Stewart. Her study showed that X-raying pregnant women caused leukemia in the babies. That just wasn't acceptable by the medical profession.

**John Barkhausen:** Was it unpatriotic to be against the technology of radiation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That really didn't get started as a political issue until the later 50s. It became a very dangerous thing for any academic person to criticize either X-rays or atmospheric atomic bomb tests. If you said they were killing people in Utah by the fallout, you were probably labeled a communist. John Gofman was one of the main government propagandists in favor of continuing bomb tests. I considered him a government demon all through the 50s. Later, in the late 1960s, he said he was giving a speech defending atmospheric bomb testing because there had been no evidence that it caused mutations, and while he was saying that, he realized that it was a crazy thing to be doing. He simply changed suddenly from being the government's biggest propagandist.

## Caller: Stress Hormones and Weight Loss

**George (Caller):** If you're trying to turn off stress hormones, should you err on the possibility of overeating until you're stable with temps and pulses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar is the single most immediately effective food for stopping stress—sometimes salt. So a food with mixed components, including enough sodium and glucose or fructose, will stop some of the worst stress hormones.

**George (Caller):** Would losing excess weight help you gain that stability because of reduced body fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you lose too fast, that is going to cause damage by oxidative decomposition of the unsaturated fats as they're being oxidized at a higher rate. I think slow weight loss is the best thing. Having enough protein and minerals in your diet during weight loss can make a tremendous difference in the amount of stress. When a person goes on a complete fast for a week or two, they lose very little fat but a lot of protein and functioning tissue. But if they eat about a 1000 calorie diet, they can lose almost entirely fat. So the minerals as well as the protein are very important to reduce the stress hormones which will take down your good tissues when you're losing weight.

## Listener Question: Hormones

**John Barkhausen:** Priscilla asks: "Can you refer me to a source of information about the workings of hormones in the body? It seems any mention of them is laughed off as having to do with sex or anxiety."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The definition of hormone has changed a lot in the last 30 or 40 years, so the classical definitions hardly apply anymore. It's good to look at one of the classical textbooks of endocrinology. One from about 30 or 40 years ago would be Constance Martin, *Textbook of Endocrine Physiology*.

Also, Hans Selye did something called the *Encyclopedia of Endocrinology* in the 1940s. His work was very influential for my thinking. He very early showed the dangers of estrogen and the protective effects of progesterone and pregnenolone. If the medical industry had really paid attention, the country would have been much healthier.

## Managing Migraines and Metabolism

**John Barkhausen:** What was the next doctor experience you had after the fluoroscope and the naturopath?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I stayed away from doctors after that. But because of my experience with migraine, when I was nine or ten, I started getting nearsighted. I noticed that the only other kids in my school who were nearsighted were girls, and a couple of them were also migraineurs. That got me thinking: why are more girls nearsighted and subject to migraine headaches?

I started looking at people in terms of their hormones. I was thinking along the lines of the suppressive effects of estrogen on metabolism, blood sugar regulation, and thyroid function. In my early teens, I discovered that a change in my eating rhythm would invariably trigger a migraine if I was very active physically. I would draw down my glycogen supplies, and if I hadn't replenished them fast enough, I would develop a migraine.

After thinking about that for years, I realized I could intervene. It happened that I had a couple of quarts of ice cream in the fridge. Realizing I hadn't been eating enough, I ate a quart of ice cream as fast as I could when the blind spots were already starting to flash. I found that they turned right off as I absorbed the ice cream.

**John Barkhausen:** You didn't switch to ice cream headaches instead?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, those were very minor. Several other things added to that. Someone told me about eating a raw carrot being a way to interrupt a headache, and I found that worked too.

I had read some of the books of a famous gastroenterologist, Walter Alvarez. He found that the intestine was involved in a very high percentage of headaches. He wanted to disprove the idea that headaches are caused by toxins; he believed they were caused by pressure in the intestine. To demonstrate, he stuffed some of his medical students' rectums with wads of cotton, and about half of them developed headaches.

Other researchers were working on the intestine with both toxins and pressure. Russian researchers would put an inflatable balloon in the intestine of a rabbit. If the rabbit was in normal health, nothing would happen. But if the rabbit had low blood sugar, blowing up the balloon would cause all kinds of symptoms, including epileptic seizures. An allergen or chemical irritant would cause a range of symptoms from seizures to shock if blood sugar was low. But if blood sugar was high, chemical irritants had almost no effect biologically.

**John Barkhausen:** So that's how the ice cream was working—to protect you with sugar?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The carrot would apparently do multiple things: absorb toxins or speed along the elimination of toxins, and prevent pressure and chemical irritation. So you could work on either side of it: keeping the blood sugar up or reducing the irritation to the intestine.

## Thyroid Testing History

**John Barkhausen:** At some point, blood tests began to be used extensively. When did that start?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** My awareness of it started around the late 1940s. Some of my fat friends in school told me they had previously been told they had a glandular problem and were given thyroid. But with the new medical science in the late 40s, they discovered they were just gluttons. They had been given a test called Protein Bound Iodine (PBI). If your PBI was okay, you just had the psychological problem of eating too much.

About half of the people who went to doctors with overweight would get a thyroid prescription and cure their problem. After science intervened with a blood test, 95% of those people were told they were perfectly normal hormonally and taken off thyroid.

At that same time, synthetic thyroxine was introduced. It was tested on medical students—who at that time were all young men in their early 20s. When they were given a dose of synthetic thyroxine, it worked exactly the same as a dose of Armour thyroid. So the pharmaceutical industry displaced the meat industry-based Armour product because it was "more scientific."

They neglected to notice that most thyroid patients were women, and that women—especially if their thyroid is low—have much more sluggish livers than men. It's easier for a woman to get drunk on a small amount of alcohol because the liver throws it off so slowly. The same applies to aspirin and other drugs. Women are more sensitive because the liver is slowed down by estrogen.

When the liver is very sluggish, thyroxine isn't turned into the active hormone, but it does suppress the pituitary. The pituitary senses the presence of thyroid hormone and stops stimulating the gland. So the frequent event throughout the 1950s and 60s was that women would actually be made worse by turning off their remaining thyroid function by dosing them with this synthetic drug.

**John Barkhausen:** So that's a case of them doing the tests, but interpreting them in such a way that it didn't help the patient.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. During this time, the PBI test showed that only 5% of the population tested low. But as new tests became possible in the 60s using immune techniques, they found that the PBI test had nothing to do with thyroid function. However, the concept had been built into the profession that only 5% of people are really biologically lacking thyroid function. So they devised new tests and standardized them on the same population framework that the meaningless test had created. Ever since then, no matter how sensitive your measurement gets, if they're stuck on the idea that the "normal" range covers 95% of results, they stretch the test to fit a bad definition of normal.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that because of money, or did they just take a wrong turn?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drug industry controls the world. Carla Rothenberg, a law student at Harvard, wrote a very good paper on the history of the estrogen industry during those same years. The industry didn't like the way science was going—which was showing that estrogen was able to create abortions, produce cancer, inflammation, and degeneration. But they had products that could be made cheaply. A conspiracy of 12 or 13 big corporations decided to get the FDA and the population in line with mass media and public relations to sell the idea that estrogen was a fertility-promoting medicine rather than a sterility promoter. Starting in 1942, science was turned on its head for basically 60 years.

## Listener Questions: Ethics, 9/11, and Hormones

**John Barkhausen:** Paul asks: "By reducing conflict with others and within one's own mind, can kindness, generosity, and ethical conduct promote healthy metabolism?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think so.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you ever recommend meditation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meditation in the sense of watching your own consciousness, being mindful of your body and the world in general. I think everyone should always be doing that. By being aware of yourself and the world, you can avoid confusing the two. When I was working on linguistics, I realized that people are really participating inside each other's minds. The Russian physiologist Anokhin devised a way of explaining how reflexes work in terms of the "acceptor of action," which is essentially a model of the world built in our consciousness. We adjust that according to the results of our senses.

**John Barkhausen:** Paul also asks: "Do you consider the US government's explanation for the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers plausible?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I haven't heard anything from any government official that makes sense. I think there are quite a few possible explanations that are more plausible than the government story.

**John Barkhausen:** Can you discuss the functions of oxytocin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's one of the adaptive hormones, but it has some stress-related responses, so I don't see it as the "happiness and euphoria" hormone. It can go up under stress too. It's sort of like the parasympathetic system—it is a good relief to the sympathetic system, but you don't want to go too far in that direction.

All of the pituitary hormones are pretty expendable as long as you keep your thyroid working. Researchers removed pituitaries from animals and gave them thyroid, and found the animals were healthier without their pituitaries.

## Healing Speeds and Carbon Monoxide

**John Barkhausen:** Can you offer any anecdotes about slow, gradual healing for people who don't respond quickly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When it isn't instantaneous, it tends to be gradual. When you are lucky and hit the missing thing on the first try, you can see things go from miserable to perfect in an hour. But if you don't hit the one missing factor, it can involve very slow repair. Sometimes a person will supplement progesterone and feel perfect, but then hit another point in the monthly cycle and things go out of balance. The body changes so drastically cyclically that it goes through repair phases. Bones can take quite a while to repair, but I've seen people with crippling arthritis where their joint becomes painless overnight.

**John Barkhausen:** What are your plans for the next five or ten years?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I expect to keep writing newsletters. Currently, I've been thinking about the importance of carbon monoxide in our endogenous regulatory processes. For 20 years I've been talking about keeping your carbon *dioxide* up. But everything I've been talking about—bright light, thyroid, coffee, fruit—acts in the same direction to decrease carbon *monoxide*.

When we are under stress, we produce carbon monoxide. The ups and downs of pituitary hormones (ACTH, TSH, oxytocin) act partly by increasing carbon monoxide production. That seems to be one of the reasons why removing the pituitary gland in experimental animals had such beneficial effects—because of the harmful, age-advancing effects of endogenous carbon monoxide.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's dangerous from outside sources as well as inside?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The outside adds to what's going on inside. If someone has a tendency to liver disease or seizures, going downtown where the carbon monoxide might be 20 or 30 parts per million could be enough to trigger symptoms. When I used to drive through downtown Los Angeles, I would tend to get lost on days when the carbon monoxide was up around 50 parts per million.

## Disease Manifestation and Genetics

**John Barkhausen:** Wade asks: "Why does someone develop Alzheimer's while another gets multiple sclerosis? What determines the disease course?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The health of your other organs influences the shape of the deterioration. In multiple sclerosis, clots tend to associate with the plaques or inflamed areas. In Alzheimer's, the clotting system is involved differently. Some people think the amyloid plaques are produced to make up for the leakiness of the capillaries.

It's basically a blood vessel leaky problem being handled from opposite sides. In MS, the clot seems to start the process. In Alzheimer's, the capillaries get leaky, produce a micro-hemorrhage, and an enzyme that clears away the heme is the enzyme that forms carbon monoxide. This enzyme is associated with amyloid plaques.

Cancer develops possibly starting with the same leakage of blood vessels, leading to increased deposition of connective tissue and atrophy. Within that area of atrophy, cells convert themselves to live without the ordinary support of the environment. All are cells trying to correct a problem but not having enough energy to do it properly.

**John Barkhausen:** We often hear that genetics determines disease.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone has genes, so genetics explains everything, but they haven't made a convincing case. Usually, about half the people with a disease might have genes that contribute to it, others don't. Harry Rubin, a biology professor at UC Berkeley, pointed out that very highly mutated cells can have dozens of cancer-promoting mutations, but as long as they are in a healthy organism, they don't produce cancer. It's the failure of the organism's support system first.

## Metabolic Rate and Blood Pressure

**John Barkhausen:** Sandy asks: "Is it useful to compare the basal metabolic rate to the daily caloric intake to gauge one's metabolic rate?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are many ways you can do it. The more alive you are, the more energy is running through you. From puberty to old age, oxygen consumption decreases by about 70% unless you intervene. This corresponds to the increase in mortality.

G.W. Crile and his wife went around the world with basal metabolic apparatus. They found that people in very different cultures—from Eskimos to tropical people—had basal metabolic rates about 30% higher than the average American. He saw a correspondence of brain function to adrenal, liver, and thyroid metabolism. He showed that a crocodile at rest consumed only as much oxygen as a cat at rest, despite weighing hundreds of pounds, and showed their brains were the same size. He believed the brain represented the basal metabolic rate.

**John Barkhausen:** Justin asks about chronically low blood pressure (85/60). Is this a problem?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it reflects a low metabolic rate. You could probably be more productive if you were producing more energy. When I spent time in Florida, I was miserable because of the humidity and couldn't take my usual amount of thyroid without overheating. At night, my blood pressure would go down to something like 50 over 25.

## Listener Questions: PSA, Acne, and Digestion

**John Barkhausen:** Robin asks: "Why are they testing for PSAs even though he has had his prostate removed?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They believe it indicates prostate cells lodged in other parts of the body. But when you measure that antigen in women, it doesn't mean they have prostate cancer. PSA stands for Prostate Specific Antigen, but it's found in women who don't have a prostate, so it's not accurately named.

**John Barkhausen:** Stefan asks about teen acne. Causes and cures?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen topical progesterone work almost instantly; a pimple would regress as soon as they put progesterone on it. But it usually involves a bacterial infection and the immune system reacting badly. Vitamin A and thyroid function are essential for the differentiation of skin cells. The skin is a major source of steroid hormone synthesis. Cholesterol can be turned into steroids, but thyroid and Vitamin A are needed to maintain healthy turnover.

**John Barkhausen:** A listener asks: "I've read that people with Alzheimer's don't tend to get cancer."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know if that happens. Alzheimer's is not consistently diagnosed. Sometimes people who get to be 95 get diagnosed with Alzheimer's just for being absent-minded, when they might not have the diagnostic features a younger person would have.

## Caller: Body Heat and Libido

**Caller:** Eating a calorie-dense meal like a pancake seems to warm me up more than drinking orange juice. Why do you not consider starch superior to liquids for raising body heat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Starch, slightly more than sucrose, triggers insulin. Insulin tends to lead to increased cortisol production, and cortisol can raise your body temperature. But that isn't the kind of increased metabolism that is generally helpful; it warms you up by a stress reaction. Some people wake up warm (stress hormones) and then cool down after eating. Cycling heat production down during the night and up during the day leads to longer-range benefit.

**Caller:** At what age can a male expect to maintain a healthy sex life?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It shouldn't have any particular age relation. Testosterone, DHEA, and thyroid are all part of good sexual energy. There's no reason why those should drop off.

**Caller:** Do you consider drugs like Viagra to be helpful or harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Harmful. It acts largely by increasing nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and those have lots of harmful effects.

## Calcium and Gut Health

**John Barkhausen:** I've been reading about the supposed problem of having too much calcium causing calcification. Is that accurate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that's the result of medical people having a mechanical way of thinking. For at least 50 years, it's been known that parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases when you're deficient in calcium. If you aren't eating enough calcium, PTH will take calcium out of your bones and put it into your soft tissues, contributing to hardened arteries, kidneys, and brain calcification.

The prevention is to get enough Vitamin D and Vitamin K, and plenty of calcium to keep PTH, prolactin, and cortisol down. The surest way to calcify your arteries is to be a calcium avoider.

**John Barkhausen:** What about intention in testing? It seems the medical industry has gotten away from treating the patient to running a business.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, with X-rays, they have to keep their equipment busy to pay for it. A lot of testing is done to prevent lawsuits.

**John Barkhausen:** A question came in by email: "Are there dangers to antibiotics modifying gut flora? What are the best factors for cleaning the gut?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The best, safest long-range things are the indigestible but antiseptic fibers of raw carrot or bamboo shoots. The whole small intestine in a very healthy person is sterile. The more active your digestive fluids and enzymes are, the more sterile your small intestine will be. Sluggish metabolism leads to bacteria living further up in the intestine. Stimulating the intestine with raw carrot helps, but keeping your metabolic rate up is the basic thing.
