## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** We are speaking with Dr. Raymond Peat out in Eugene, Oregon. He's an endocrinologist and physiologist who has written a lot of books about health, nutrition, and science, and publishes *Ray Peat's Newsletter*. You can find him on the web at raypeat.com.

Just yesterday we were doing a sound check and we picked up where we left off last week, talking about fats in our diet and the use of fats by humans over the years and as animal feed. You were talking about cholesterol and mentioned a fellow named Chris Masterjohn. One of the things you said that shocked me was that for years we've heard that cholesterol is something you get from fat—from butter, beef fat, or meats full of supposedly saturated fats—and that's why we're being poisoned by cholesterol. But it turns out that perhaps cholesterol isn't the boogeyman we always thought it was. It's actually something we need to function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but regarding eating cholesterol: if you're healthy, you have to eat a tremendous amount to raise your levels. There was an experiment where they had healthy young men eat eggs until they could see an increase in blood cholesterol. It took 22 eggs before they saw a rise in the day's cholesterol. It does rise if you're very sick and can't compensate.

In a practical situation where a person might want to raise their cholesterol, you can usually do it just by eating lots of fruit. The minerals and sugar in the fruit give the liver the energy it needs to make adequate cholesterol. There is a U-shaped curve of mortality. You have an ideal range of cholesterol for a given age, and when you're below that range, your mortality increases.

**John Barkhausen:** What are those ranges?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The people who talk about the curve usually put the bottom of the U around 160 to 180 mg/dL. But when you look at the figures, the bottom really varies with age. One study looked at people in a nursing home situation and saw that the ones who had the highest cholesterol—I think in that group those with 270—lived the longest. So you have to think about the relation of the cholesterol to the stress you're under and consider it an anti-stress hormone.

## Statins and Pharmaceutical Influence

**John Barkhausen:** My father recently was told that he has to start taking statins. A lot of people are on statins. What's your opinion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago they started seeing increased mortality as they used drugs to lower cholesterol. There was a Hungarian study in the 1980s that showed a great increase in cancer mortality as they lowered cholesterol. That somewhat accorded with a Veterans Administration study in the 1960s that they stopped when they saw that people on the so-called heart-protective low-fat diet were dying at a higher rate from cancer.

There are still some lingering data showing that statins might increase total mortality, but the marketing is so intense that they manage to place articles convincing people how good it is. A recent book by Melody Peterson, titled *Our Daily Meds*, gives a lot of information about how the drug industry manipulates the culture—paying doctors well, writing articles for doctors, and getting them to sign their names to publish them in prestigious journals. It gives a little bit of the inside information about how they're actually buying the medical literature.

Marcia Angell, seeing it from an editor's viewpoint at the *New England Journal of Medicine*, emphasized that editorial decisions can completely bias the results of a topic. If people choose not to submit their data because it doesn't support the efficacy or safety of a drug, a lot of studies will simply not get submitted. If the editors introduce more bias, you might have 50 studies showing a drug is harmful and useless and one that gets published showing that it's beneficial.

Melody Peterson shows how the drug industry is not only modifying the research that gets done and how universities treat their research, but how the journals publish it and finally how the doctors use it. The system is pretty well sewed up now. Anything relating to drug therapy, you simply can't trust the Anglo-American literature. Increasingly, it has spread into Italy, Chile, France, and Japan as the industries become influential in those countries. India and Russia were relatively outside the commercial pharmaceutical influence, but now they're moving in that direction too.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's an effect of globalization?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, though some of the more backward economies still manage to do some real research.

## Essential Fatty Acids and Fish Oil

**John Barkhausen:** Getting back to cholesterol, the last time you were on the air you spoke about Chris Masterjohn.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've read several of his articles that are very good. My only disagreement with him is that he persists in believing in essential fatty acids.

**John Barkhausen:** That's something a lot of alternative health people believe in. In a nutshell, what's your view on the essential fatty acids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first claim was that it was linoleic acid. Then maybe linolenic was added. But after the Burr studies of the late 1920s and early 30s, by the 1940s their disease was shown to be nothing but a vitamin B6 deficiency. At just about the same time, agricultural researchers were showing that linolenic and linoleic acid were the causes of brain degeneration, testicular degeneration, infertility, and muscle degeneration.

Fish oils about the same time were causing mink degenerative disease. "Yellow fat disease" was showing up in more and more animals as they were fed fish waste because of an excess of the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) in the fish fats. Finally, linoleic acid was recognized to be essential for cancer, but not at all essential for nutrition.

The publicity coming out that the original "essential" fatty acids were essential for cancer discouraged marketing in that direction. That's when it shifted to marketing fish oil as the *new* version of the essential fatty acids. That's where we are now, at the peak of the fish oil promotion. They are being recommended at higher intake levels to actually function as drugs to supposedly cure a lot of diseases. But in fact, the old research going back 40 or 50 years shows that it is simply a temporary suppression of inflammatory symptoms while, in the long run, increasing the inflammatory degenerative processes.

**John Barkhausen:** So the reason people have a subsiding of their symptoms is just that their immune system has been knocked down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** David Horrobin, who was a big promoter of polyunsaturated fats and who died of brain cancer while trying to treat himself with his own fats, published work showing that fish oil is very immune-suppressive. Others looking at why fish oil is anti-inflammatory found that it wasn't the original long-chain polyunsaturated fats found in the fish. When they are processed and hit the hot organs of a mammal, they break down. It's the breakdown products—the aldehydes and free radicals decomposed from the fish oils—which are actually the anti-inflammatory substances. It's the deterioration of the material that produces temporary relief, but it's also those things which contribute to serious long-range problems such as brain damage and vascular damage.

**John Barkhausen:** You were saying last week that fish oil does have some good properties, like lots of vitamin A and D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Depends on how it's made, but in its crude form, it does come with a lot of vitamin D and A. There have been products on the market extracted from fish liver oil in which they concentrate the vitamin D and A so you can get your daily dose in a couple of drops of the oil.

**John Barkhausen:** Some people are taking fish oil for antidepressants.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies in the published literature—the ones I've seen were just about an equal number saying it isn't effective as say it is effective. Same with using it as a supplement to baby food. There are studies that show that it retards brain development, even though they don't get discussed very much.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that the DHA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhausen:** And they've started adding that to baby food. So flaxseed oil has gone out of fashion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so. The literature in the 1980s became overwhelming showing that linoleic acid in particular is really the basic motor for pushing cancer excess. Linolenic isn't quite as bad, so flax is as bad as some of the others.

**John Barkhausen:** If essential oils are only essential for creating disease, how is it that they're so heavily promoted by the government?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several years ago the FDA had a warning not to use more than, I think, three grams a day of those long-chain unsaturated fats from fish oil. I think they've dropped that warning, or at least it isn't prominent like it used to be. Right from its very beginning, the FDA was captured by the food industry and then the drug industry. Now they really are working primarily as a corporate defense system.

**John Barkhausen:** It always seems like they absorb the liability for the corporations. If they approve it, then you can't sue the corporation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, same thing as government protecting the nuclear industry by saying you can't collect more than a certain amount of damages if a reactor explodes in your neighborhood. The Public Health Service has a worse record than the FDA itself. The FDA interfaces with the consumers and tries to keep them happy, but at higher levels, the agencies have been more defensive of the power structure. In the years of the fallout from atmospheric bomb testing, the Public Health Service was destroying data and putting out false data about the safety of radiation.

## Radiation and the Bystander Effect

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe you could talk about radiation for a minute and how the government's bias has made it more widespread.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For 50 or 60 years, I've been hearing from dentists and doctors that the dose they give you in examining you is very small and harmless. Then they reduce it tenfold and say exactly the same thing. The words are the same from 1940 right down to the current day. They claim they have digitalized machines and people think it's just bits of information coming through their bodies, but it's still the same old X-rays. They're exciting their cells.

Even Linus Pauling took a less than adequate biological view. He was warning about the dangers, but he was looking only at DNA damage. The damage is much subtler than breaking strands of DNA. The excited electrons cause chemical and physiological changes that linger, completely distinct from the immediate reaction of radiation with the DNA.

For example, you can give a dose of radiation to cells in a dish and then add new cells that weren't exposed to radiation to that dish. The new cells will start mutating a day or more later from something emitted by the exposed cells. That process lingers in the tissues and the blood serum. It's called the "bystander effect." You can demonstrate in the lab that cells that weren't exposed start behaving as if they were exposed by contact with the damaged cells.

People exposed to the Hiroshima bomb have been studied 60 years later, and they still showed essentially excited electronic states in their tissues. The same with people about 20 years after the Chernobyl exposure; their serum is still toxic. It can be removed from their blood and added to healthy cells, and the healthy cells begin mutating.

The safety assumptions were based on the model of how a beam of radiation will affect a molecule. It was worked out in terms of direct interaction between a molecule and radiation, but in the organism, that simply isn't how it works. Russians way back in the 60s were showing that. The Western paradigm was that if you irradiated an animal's brain it would go into estrus, supposedly because something was altered in the pituitary causing the ovaries to produce more estrogen. The Russians did a control experiment in which they irradiated the animal's foot instead of its brain, and it still went into estrus. They called it some kind of radiation toxin that was emitted by the exposed tissue.

It's the same thing that happens in the bystander effect. It's some physiological, biochemical change that is started by the radiation but then spreads and continues. The increased estrogen happens to imitate these processes started by the radiation.

**John Barkhausen:** So you're saying a little bit of radiation causes this cascading effect throughout the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Two or three years ago in Seattle, they were using low-level, fancy, latest well-calibrated X-ray equipment and covering the patients with lead aprons. They found that a full set of dental X-rays, if the woman was pregnant at the time—even though her body was shielded thoroughly—resulted in her baby being underweight. It showed basically the same effects as taking a dose of estrogen while pregnant: it spreads a stress influence that malnourishes the developing fetus.

## Scientific Dogma: In Silico and Genetics

**John Barkhausen:** The method you used to describe how the government assessed the dangers of radiation—where they just had a hypothetical theory about one molecule being affected but didn't take into account the living organism—you've said before that that's common in how science is conducted in the West. They do a lot of experiments in test tubes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Worse than that. If you look through PubMed, you see lots of abstracts described as *in vitro*, but now they have the concept *in silico*.

**John Barkhausen:** What does that mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It means they didn't have anything living at all; it was all done in a computer. But people read the article and they're used to seeing *in vitro* and think real cells were involved. *In silico* means in the computer. It's like the medieval arguments about angels—how much floor space does an angel need to dance? It is a way of amplifying your favorite hypothesis or assumption.

**John Barkhausen:** In studying science, I think a lot of people are confused. We figure it's empirical and they're testing theories all the time, so the best theory will end up on top. How come that isn't the way it works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of reasons, but the basic thing is that it's all filtered through the culture and the system of assumptions. If you look at different cultures, the whole background of philosophy and religion influences what you think can be taken seriously as an assumption.

Because in medieval times people believed in alchemy and astrology, ordinary chemists and physiologists think it's absurd to consider the phase of the moon when doing a chemical or biological study. But several people have looked at lab results done over a period of time and have seen that the phase of the moon *does* influence many experiments.

I worked in a hamster lab at the university where the indoor temperature was kept constant and the light was artificially controlled so a person would not have any cues indoors whether it was winter or summer. But somehow the hamsters knew what was going on outside the walls because their thymuses would atrophy in the winter season and come back in the spring, just like they do when exposed to changing day lengths.

Professor Brown in Indiana did many tests with potatoes, oysters, and flowering plants. He noticed his experiments varied with the moon. He got some oysters from the East Coast and studied their metabolism in Indiana. If it had been genetically determined—as the paradigm said it must be, because hamsters can't know when it's winter if you control their lights—it must be a genetically operated clock. Brown took his oysters to Indiana, and they were still metabolically cycling as if the tides were coming into Indiana. He did the same thing with potatoes, which aren't susceptible to tides, and saw a similar metabolic moon cycle.

He took plants into a mine shaft and they kept cycling until they got hundreds of feet below the surface. Finally, they didn't receive a cue and no longer cycled. He demonstrated that some lunar or planetary influence was able to penetrate hundreds of feet of shielding. This disproved the idea that it's all controlled by an abstract genetic clock.

**John Barkhausen:** So you're saying that genetics is a dogma that's been accepted by the culture?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It really is primarily a kind of religious belief. Remember the Lamarck-Cuvier controversy? The person who took over the museum that Lamarck had been the director of was a Christian catastrophist who basically said there was no evolution; it was accounted for by a flood destroying the ancient species. In history, genetics as an anti-environmental approach was strictly a biblical orientation against the Lamarckian environmentalist orientation.

**John Barkhausen:** I always thought the genetic orientation is very convenient for liability. If you can't directly link pollution to a problem in a simple cause-and-effect, they can always just say it's genetics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has been very convenient for the medical profession for the last 50 or 60 years. It's either genetic or it's a virus, and there's nothing you can do to expect a cure. Especially with cancer, the government was very influential in reinforcing that interpretation. That's closely related to military medical research. The germ warfare people were getting government subsidies and were inclined to the "it's your own fault for having bad genes" theory.

Environmentalism in cancer research simply couldn't get funding after about 1945. The idea that embryos develop according to a developmental field and gradient was the dominant theory, along with the idea that cancer is a metabolic, physiological field distortion. Embryology and cancer were related to these metabolic and pattern-based ideas. The genetics and militaristic approach simply cut those off. When the government came out of the war having funded the Manhattan Project, that sort of money was directed into germ warfare research. That gradually shifted to so-called cancer research. The Fort Detrick germ warfare lab simply changed its name while not doing very different research when it shifted over to the "War on Cancer."

## Cholesterol Receptors and Thyroid Function

**John Barkhausen:** So these cultural beliefs seem to be directing research and taking some theories for truth while rejecting others regardless of empirical evidence. They are also responsible for the misinformation we've heard about cholesterol.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They talk about genetically determined tendencies towards high cholesterol that you can see in the form of cholesterol receptors. The whole idea of a "receptor" is a genetic pharmacological idea. It is very much like the ads you see on TV where a drug zooms around in your body and goes right to the place where it's needed.

One drug company was collecting genes from a village in the Mediterranean where people didn't have heart disease, trying to promote gene change as a drug product. But the environmental influences simply weren't of interest. If you can identify a problem as a permanent genetic feature and then work on that gene receptor with a drug, you've got a product.

But the cholesterol receptors are regulated by hormones such as the thyroid. If a person doesn't have enough of the receptor that takes cholesterol out of your blood, you can take thyroid and increase the amount of that receptor. But that doesn't please anyone but the thyroid industry, and they haven't really taken advantage of it.

**John Barkhausen:** I know a lot of people who take thyroid. There are several products on the market—Synthroid, Cytomel, Cynoplus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, the main product was made by the Armour Meat Company, which became the Armour Pharmaceutical Company. They had a lot of beef and pork thyroids they didn't know what to do with, so they would dehydrate and sell them as a drug product. That was the standard treatment. When they would give patients the Armour thyroid, containing both T4 and T3, the symptoms would be alleviated.

But after the war, a company came on the market with purified Thyroxine (T4), which is only a fraction of the Armour thyroid. The thyroid contains a protein and liberates two substances, T4 and T3. T4 is released by the gland about four times as much as the active T3. When the environment is right, the liver completes the activation so that most of your thyroid function is really coming from the liver.

After the war, the drug companies had an interest in promoting a product. They said the main substance, and the easiest to make, was Thyroxine. They gave it to 25-year-old male medical students—very healthy people—and said it works just like real thyroid. But they didn't test it in sick people or in women. Women's livers are much less active than men's because of the effect of estrogen. But the drug product Thyroxine was sold across the board even though it had only been tested in young men.

It was more than 10 years later that the real active hormone, T3, came on the market. The tests that determined whether you were hypothyroid disregarded all the symptoms that had been associated with hypothyroidism up until about 1945. The tests at first measured only the iodine bound to protein, which has very little to do with your thyroid function. According to those tests, the Thyroxine product would raise your protein-bound iodine, so that was compatible with marketing the synthetic drug.

After about 20 years, they saw that the protein-bound iodine test had almost nothing to do with thyroid function. If you ate seaweed, you would get a lot of protein-bound iodine, but your thyroid function would go down. So they started looking for new ways to test. But they had established over those 20 years that instead of half the population benefiting from thyroid, the tests suggested only 5% would benefit. So any new test has been standardized to that paradigm of looking at a percentage of the population rather than whether the substance cures symptoms. Now they are treating the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level and disregarding the actual effect of the hormone on the person's health.

**John Barkhausen:** So they're basically treating one of the markers instead of the actual symptoms. That seems to happen a lot in medicine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and they call it "subclinical" and don't even make it explicit what they mean by clinical.

## AIDS and Viral Theory

**John Barkhausen:** The AIDS test is something like that, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. There have been several traditional drugs that alleviate symptoms, but those tend to be suppressed or forgotten. The so-called virus has attracted very little attention. What they're doing now is using a lab process to amplify a substance that relates to the virus—it isn't the actual virus—but they call it the "viral load." It's something they create in the laboratory. Meanwhile, they ignore the use of other therapies or consider them simply additional therapies to be added to the profitable drugs.

**John Barkhausen:** You were going to say something else about the AIDS drugs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are a couple of very good books. One is *Inventing the AIDS Virus* by Peter Duesberg, and the other is by Harvey Bialy about Peter Duesberg. I've been following it now for 20 years, and the establishment people just don't want to talk about it. They won't let these people publish responses to articles in the major journals. So the average doctor reading it thinks they have no answer, but it's just that the editors don't want to hear their answer. The mainline virus theory people have never answered the criticisms of Peter Duesberg, who basically says the virus is harmless.

**John Barkhausen:** That begs the question, what's causing the harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He thinks it's a drug. I'm inclined to the idea that it's the interaction of drugs, polyunsaturated fats, radiation exposure, and other toxins in the environment.

**John Barkhausen:** So that would be another case of an environmental problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you graph the incidence of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome over the last 60 years, it's a straight progressive increase since the bomb tests began after the Second World War. There was no sudden jump at the time AIDS became official as a disease. It's a steady increase going back 60 years.

## Conclusion

**John Barkhausen:** Well, we're just about out of time. We've been talking to Dr. Raymond Peat from Eugene, Oregon. He's a physiologist and endocrinologist and puts out *Ray Peat's Newsletter*. You can find him on the web at raypeat.com where you have a lot of excellent articles.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I have another 10 or 15 that will go up in a couple of weeks, I hope.

**John Barkhausen:** Great. Even if you don't necessarily agree with everything said there, there is plenty of food for thought and a lot of medical and scientific history that I certainly have never heard before. Thanks, Ray, for your work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.

**John Barkhausen:** We'll talk to you soon. Bye bye.
