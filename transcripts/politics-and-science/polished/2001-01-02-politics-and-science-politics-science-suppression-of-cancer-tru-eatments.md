## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Hello and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhausen. Today we feature an archive of my interview with Dr. Raymond Peat, recorded circa 2001. In the show, he discusses the remarkable story of Dr. Stevan Durovic and his cancer treatment known as Krebiozen. He also covers the heroic but ultimately fruitless efforts by Dr. Andrew C. Ivy, who was at the time one of America's most prominent scientists. Dr. Ivy attempted to give this promising treatment the clinical testing that its positive findings warranted.

In case you're interested in this subject, the meticulously written book that tells the story in detail is by Herbert Smith Bailey and is called *Krebiozen: Key to Cancer*. In this show, Dr. Peat also discusses the suppressed work of an earlier brilliant cancer researcher, Dr. William F. Koch, and his successful cancer treatments. If you're interested in Dr. Raymond Peat's work, many of his writings are available at his website, raypeat.com. And now, once again, here's Dr. Raymond Peat.

## The History of Free Radical Chemistry

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A.C. Ivy and these people all overlap for various reasons, partly because several of the alternative health—especially alternative cancer treatment—people were working on essentially the same ideas, and they were all attacked by the established forces that were working on different assumptions.

**John Barkhausen:** What year was this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Koch started his work around 1911 or 1914, and by the twenties, he had the clinic going in Cleveland. He was a professor of medicine and chemistry, and he was the first person to take seriously for biochemistry the work on free radicals by Moses Gomberg. Gomberg demonstrated that free radicals really exist; they aren't just a hypothesis that exists only on paper.

Moses Gomberg showed that highly colored chemicals appear when you can get free radicals to separate in solution. The color appears because the electron that is no longer paired is free enough that it absorbs light in the visible spectrum. One of the simple ways to test for an unpaired electron is that suddenly the solution goes dark. Even chemists didn't take Gomberg seriously. In Russia, he was a major influence, but in the United States, for probably 40 or 50 years, free radical chemistry just couldn't take off.

The head of one of the early chemistry plastics companies told William Koch that he had better be quiet about the idea of applying free radical chemistry in medicine because people didn't even understand it in ordinary organic chemistry. They were going to say he was talking about fantasies if he talked about the free radical basis of biology.

It was around the 1950s that the instrumentation became available to demonstrate that free radicals really did exist in living tissue. Barry Commoner was one of the first people to demonstrate free radicals existing in living tissues.

**John Barkhausen:** I didn't know that. When did the free radical theory start?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 1900 to 1905 was when Moses Gomberg was demonstrating them. But immediately, Koch was putting it into theoretical thinking about what cells are doing. He applied it to the concept of polymerization and blood clotting. He knew that in healing a wound or a cancer, blood clotting is one of the first things that happens, and clotting abnormalities are characteristic of cancer.

It turned out that for places like DuPont, polymerization was a very important practical industrial principle using the free radical. But Koch anticipated even industrial thinking. Within just a few years of starting to work on it, he was applying it theoretically and practically to devise both explanations for disease and therapies.

**John Barkhausen:** He seems like quite a brilliant man.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, he was quick to apply knowledge that was very clear and definite, but other people couldn't accept it because it didn't seem to fit the low standard that was common in chemistry and biology at that time.

## The Science of Dilution and Reaction

**John Barkhausen:** The free radical theory must have come out of the atomic theory of electrons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. In ordinary chemistry on paper, they would show an atom coming loose, or an atom with other atoms attached to it coming loose from another group and taking one electron away, where each atom had been contributing an electron to a pair that made a stable compound. On paper, they could take away a group with one electron and allow it to combine somewhere else, but they couldn't believe that could really exist in a watery solution.

Moses Gomberg first did it with triphenylmethyl. It had three large carbon rings attached to one tiny little molecule in the center. The tendency of the benzene rings to repel because they were placed too close together, and the fact that the whole group wasn't very soluble in water, created a reaction. If you kept adding water to a solution of this compound, as it got very highly dilute, the color would suddenly change from clear to a deep purple. As you got it diluted enough, the groups would be able to fall apart from each other and exist freely in solution.

Anyone who knew homeopathy—which a well-educated doctor did in 1900—knew that the principle of homeopathy was that some compounds become chemically more reactive when they're highly diluted. It was natural for someone with a medical education to see the importance of this chemical principle. But not many people who had studied homeopathy as well as classical medicine also studied chemistry, which Koch did.

## Persecution and Suppression

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first time I heard about Koch was around 1943 or 1944. People were circulating little mimeographed newsletters about the scandal of how he was being persecuted by the FBI. Koch himself told some of the stories, and they have never been refuted; they are pretty well documented. He said that criminals who tried to kill him were later proven to be agents of the FBI. The public didn't start hearing of mob, FBI, or CIA connections until the Church Committee in the 70s brought that stuff out, but it was something that had been going on for a long time.

**John Barkhausen:** Is that pre-Hoover?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, that was Hoover. Hoover was there for about 50 years.

**John Barkhausen:** Why were they going after him at that point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** His clinic in Cleveland was so successful that it was bringing a lot of attention to him. Even though he followed the industrialist's advice and didn't explain the free radical basis—he was just having objective results—he had tried to publish all of the details between 1917 and 1921. He submitted papers all over the world, but the standard medical journals wouldn't accept a free radical chemical explanation for any biological events.

The government then claimed that he had a secret method simply because he couldn't get journals to publish it. They called it a secret quack method.

Years later, after I had studied Koch's books thoroughly, and I had also been studying Otto Warburg's work and Albert Szent-Györgyi's work on cancer, I noticed dramatic parallels. I outlined over two pages the amazing similarities between Koch's work done between 1910 and 1925, and what Szent-Györgyi started doing in about 1932. I wrote to Szent-Györgyi and asked, "Is this just coincidence or were you influenced by W.F. Koch?" In all of Szent-Györgyi's work, I couldn't find a single reference to W.F. Koch. He answered that he had the highest respect for the work of W.F. Koch. This obviously meant that since he had never referred to it in print, he knew what had happened to Koch and didn't want it to happen to him.

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe we could go back a little bit and talk about Koch's cancer therapy. Who was he threatening at the time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The FDA accused him of violating the law by selling something that they said couldn't cure cancer. They had it analyzed and claimed they couldn't detect anything in it but distilled water. He made some in court according to his procedure, took this highly colored material, and diluted it until it looked like distilled water. He gave a sample to them to analyze, and they said it was distilled water. The jury could see that their own eyes had seen stuff go into it, yet the government was telling them it wasn't there. Twice he was acquitted, but he decided it was time to get out of the country with people trying to kill him and keeping him constantly in court instead of doing science. He spent the rest of his life after 1944 in Brazil.

**John Barkhausen:** Are there any remnants of his work still operating in Brazil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 15 years ago, I talked to a very old man who had worked with him. I don't think there is anyone still living who was directly connected with him. Koch died around 1968.

## Koch's Reagents and Mechanism

**John Barkhausen:** What was the distilled water solution?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People who worked with him said it was done by judgment. He used a red-hot platinum reactor heated electrically to just the right color of red. He passed a stream of alcohol vapor over that. At that temperature, the alcohol polymerized into a water-soluble chain of molecules which were unstable enough that they would release the individual carbon-oxygen-hydrogen groups or small chains into solution. That was his primary reagent. He also used benzoquinone at high dilution.

**John Barkhausen:** How was it an anti-cancer therapy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of his early publications had to do with the muscle spasms that typically follow removal of the thyroid gland. Koch experimented with the removal of just the parathyroid glands and found that if you give any salt electrolyte—such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, or calcium—generously, you prevent the spasms. He argued that the parathyroid gland was involved in detoxifying compounds derived from ammonia, and that these chemicals are poisonous and known to cause seizures and muscle spasms. He demonstrated that he was causing those to be passed off in the urine by increasing salt intake.

However, A.J. Carlson, a powerful professor at the University of Chicago, decided that one hormone has only one action. They proclaimed that the parathyroid hormone mobilizes calcium and that in a calcium deficiency you get spasms. There are terrible problems with that theory, but it became the standard.

Koch explained the toxicity of these compounds as similar to what ammonia does. The amino or ammonia group occurs in many chemicals that produce seizures, spasms, and overstimulation—we now call it excitotoxicity. Ammonia, serotonin, and a tremendous range of amino compounds have this action. The carbonyl group was the essence of Koch's treatment. Whether the carbonyl was in his polymer or part of the benzoquinone molecule, Koch explained it as drawing electrons to itself, away from the electron donors of the ammonia compounds.

During this time, the acid theory of Gilbert Lewis came out in 1914. It was a general theory of acidity and alkalinity in terms of electron withdrawal or donation. It was exactly compatible with Koch's oxidation-reduction explanation. But again, the Lewis theory was displaced by the Brønsted-Lowry theory of acid, which is what everyone now teaches—that acid is a hydrogen ion donor. So Lewis's theory, which was true and general, was displaced by a basically erroneous theory.

## Szent-Györgyi and Cellular Energy

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Albert Szent-Györgyi was essentially looking for evidence of Koch's high-energy promoter of oxidation as an electron acceptor in physiology. Koch had postulated that benzoquinone was useful because there was a quinone molecule in the cell that this was a close imitation of. It wasn't until 1950 that it was discovered that there is, in fact, an essential oxidizing quinone in the mitochondria—ubiquinone.

Szent-Györgyi appreciated the logic, and while working on respiratory chemistry, he accidentally discovered big parts of the Krebs cycle and ascorbic acid.

**John Barkhausen:** Is this what he received the Nobel Prize for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, for his discoveries that led to the Krebs cycle, ascorbic acid, and muscle studies. Methylguanidine causes muscle contraction by donating electrons to a system that should have the electrons withdrawn by the oxidative catalyst. It became clearer in Szent-Györgyi's work why he was working on both muscle contraction and oxidative metabolism.

Another theory that becomes an obstacle to understanding is the membrane theory of cell function, which explains cell electricity in terms of ions and protons. Szent-Györgyi was working on the direct involvement of electrons in respiration. For example, consciousness disappears instantly when oxygen is no longer available to accept electrons, before there is any detectable change in cellular energy levels.

One of Szent-Györgyi's experiments involved adding electron donor chemicals and electron acceptor chemicals to a living muscle. If the donor and acceptor were related to each other in terms of their oxidation potential, the muscle would contract. If they were not tuned to each other, the muscle wouldn't react. This verified what Koch was saying: donating an electron to a muscle system causes it to go into the active state, and the high-energy oxidant causes it to stabilize and go into a resting state.

For Warburg, Koch, and Szent-Györgyi, cancer, allergy, muscle spasms, and seizures were all examples of the activated state in which there are excess electrons. Oxidation was the basic answer to restoring the cell to its stable resting state. This puts the cancer problem in a different evolutionary light. They saw cell division as the basic state of any cell. At a point in evolution, oxidative respiration came in and made it possible for cells to stop dividing long enough to form a multicellular organism. The reversion to cancer became simply interference with the ability to respire on the cellular level.

**John Barkhausen:** So the problem with cancer and spasms is that your cells are not getting the oxygen or can't use it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Warburg's definition of cancer metabolically was that it is aerobic glycolysis. Ordinarily, glycolysis is a process similar to fermentation; sugar is used very wastefully, and it happens in the absence of oxygen. Glycolysis happens normally only when there is no oxygen. When you block the oxygen apparatus, you get intense glycolysis. If it is the apparatus rather than the supply which is blocked, this is what happens in disease. Aerobic glycolysis is evidence that the respiring organ isn't working right.

## Dr. Ivy and Krebiozen

**John Barkhausen:** Why do you think they were so shunned by the powers that be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the case of Koch, he makes a case for rational behavior on the part of the government and medical associations, just in terms of them being badly educated, badly motivated, authoritarian people.

To understand it, the best way is to read Herbert Bailey's book about Krebiozen. Andrew Ivy was one of the biggest establishment doctors in the country—founder of several medical associations, Vice President of the University of Illinois, and America's representative to the Nuremberg trials to testify on universal medical ethics.

When a Yugoslav doctor, Dr. Stevan Durovic, came to the United States with a cancer treatment, he took his idea to Andrew Ivy. Ivy was intelligent and had been thinking that cancer might be the loss of a restraining process. This line of thinking has been demonstrated over and over. For example, if you cut off half an animal's liver, it will regrow to the right size. These chemicals of restraint were called "chalones."

Durovic said he had vaccinated horses with an organism that causes tumors, *Actinomyces bovis*, and produced a tumor, then extracted the blood of the horses. The technique was to use absolute ethanol to extract the material and then resuspend it in water. Ivy immediately was interested in testing it. He took patients whose doctors said they had only one or two months to live. In these people, he saw dramatic results. He wasn't looking for a cure at that point, but one injection would cause a high proportion of patients to have dramatic improvement.

Ivy said this stuff had to be studied in better ways. Herbert Bailey's book documents the horrifying way the power structure started acting. Andrew Ivy's positions were taken away from him. He was fired from his vice presidency and his professorship. He was kicked out of scientific organizations he had founded. He went from being at the very top of American medicine to being basically a community college teacher for the rest of his life.

**John Barkhausen:** It makes you wonder what the motives are.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A good place to start is to look at the Congressional Record from the 88th Congress and the material that Illinois Senator Paul Douglas introduced. It documents that two big drug companies and the treasurer of the American Medical Association offered Durovic two and a half million dollars for the rights to the chemical. They refused.

Basically, it was a conspiracy. As the Senator said in the Congressional Record, if this wasn't true, why aren't these chemical companies and the AMA suing for slander? They refused to comment even on why they wouldn't sue.

## Radiation and Medical Imaging

**John Barkhausen:** Are you familiar with Dr. Samuel Epstein? He feels that mammograms are not only not useful but can actually spread cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. John Gofman, whose book on the prevention of breast cancer is posted on the internet, was one of the Atomic Energy Commission's defenders of radiation in the 50s. He was a top figure in medical physics. In the 60s, he started thinking about what he was saying publicly and realized it was crazy. He says that three-quarters of breast cancers are caused by radiation, primarily medical radiation.

**John Barkhausen:** I was reading something you sent me that said bone density scans are basically X-rays.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The terrible thing is that they are going to recommend you do it anyway because you're old, and old people have thinning bones. Ultrasound technology exists that is more meaningful; it will actually tell you the strength of your bones, not just how dense they are.

In the *Journal of the American Medical Association*, someone published graphs showing the tremendous inaccuracy of the bone scan because of differences in fat and water in the tissues. Estrogen, for example, affects the distribution of fat and fluid. Estrogen causes calcium retention but no increase in bone density, yet the X-ray technique used for scanning sometimes gives an apparent increase in bone density due to the fat/water artifact.

Since ultrasound measures strength as well as density, there are overwhelming arguments why no one should ever have a bone scan. Besides being harmless and accurate, ultrasound happens to stimulate bone growth, whereas X-rays accelerate bone loss. Every time you get a bone scan, your bones are going to go away a little faster.

**John Barkhausen:** So that applies to X-rays and the teeth too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The X-rays bounce off your teeth and jawbones and accelerate the atrophy of your jawbone. But the bouncing rays go into your brain. They know that dental X-rays cause thyroid cancer and eye cancer. If they are bouncing to that extent, obviously they are going through the brain. The brain is the most sensitive of all tissues to radiation. A great way to produce Alzheimer's disease ought to be to have lots of dental X-rays.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you think they could use ultrasound on your teeth?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, there are instruments already existing that give very fine resolution. All you need is a transducer that you can put in your mouth.

## Conclusion

**John Barkhausen:** Maybe you should say where to get Herbert Bailey's book or what the name of it is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It might be hard to find. Old bookstores or libraries would be where I would look. The pressure caused the first publisher to fold up within a year, and positive reviews were cancelled. The book is called *Krebiozen: Key to Cancer*.
