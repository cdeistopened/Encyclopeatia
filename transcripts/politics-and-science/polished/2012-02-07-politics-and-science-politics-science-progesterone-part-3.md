## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Hello and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host John Barkhausen and this is part three of a discussion about progesterone and Dr. Raymond Peat's work with progesterone over the years. Dr. Peat, for those who don't know, has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialty in physiology and has done a lot of research in the fields of endocrinology and science history. So Ray, welcome once again to Politics and Science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hi.

**John Barkhausen:** In the last two shows, Ray, we covered some of the history of your work with progesterone. This week I'm hoping we'll be able to cover some of the politics and economic pressures affecting the science of progesterone. To start this off, in spite of its proven anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, progesterone is now deemed a carcinogenic substance under California's Proposition 65. How did this turn of events come to pass?

## California's Prop 65 and Legal Extortion

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The proposition says that you can sell carcinogens in any form that you want, but you just have to quote the law that says this is "known by the state of California to cause cancer and/or birth defects." It isn't a law against selling carcinogens, just that you have to warn against them.

It was partly driven by lawyers who were given the opportunity to enforce the law instead of the state; lawyers could collect the fines themselves. They chose to interpret the law to mean that the presence of anything which *could* be carcinogenic in any other situation makes a product require the warning. It ended up that parking lots had to be warned that they were carcinogenic. The public had to see a sign if they went into the parking lot.

**John Barkhausen:** What was the rationale for the parking lots, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was either the paving material or the fact that there were cars there emitting exhaust fumes. Chocolate producers were sued, manufacturers of drinking glasses that had paint on the outside, bread manufacturers, potato vendors, vegetables—anything. There was a whole wave of these insane prosecutions and lawyers made a lot of money.

The real function of that law, besides enriching lawyers, was to put the warnings everywhere—in the produce department of grocery stores, on apartment buildings, on fishing tackle and hardware—so that it became a joke. Everything was labeled a carcinogen. So, the carcinogens became invisible. The real carcinogens were submerged in this phony warning business. It was still legal to sell carcinogens, but since everything had the warning, the public basically wasn't warned against the *real* carcinogens.

**John Barkhausen:** That's a brilliant strategy on the part of business, it sounds like.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and very bad for the public. It had been brought to the attention of the Attorney General. The lawyers basically are in control of the government, so anything that would impair their ability to shake down the public doesn't interest the law enforcement people. I gathered some evidence and asked the Attorney General if nonprofit corporations aren't supposed to take money from industries to destroy their competitors. I gathered evidence that made it look pretty clear that was what was going on. They said if I can prove that they have committed a crime, they will investigate.

**John Barkhausen:** So you have to do all the work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Then they would just investigate it and say they would prosecute it.

**John Barkhausen:** I didn't quite follow. What does a nonprofit have to do with it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The nonprofit organizations were being formed either as friends for lawyers to extort money, or... I couldn't prove it because I couldn't subpoena the documents, but on its surface, it looks very much like the competing industries are using those organizations to get rid of progesterone, among other products.

**John Barkhausen:** Sure. That makes perfect sense. So they basically form a cartel and go after their competitors. It sounds like the Wild West where anybody can deputize themselves and go after somebody else to enforce this very open-ended law.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and the state prescribes the type of penalty that they can get. I think it was $50 for each drinking glass that was sold without a warning. A huge amount of money. Millions of dollars that lawyers have collected.

**John Barkhausen:** That's so Kafkaesque. It sounds ridiculous, but it actually has serious repercussions for somebody who's trying to sell a product that they think is helpful. What happens to you if you don't obtain the California seal of approval of not being a carcinogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you don't have 10 employees or more, the law doesn't apply to you. So you legally should be able to sell anything without a warning. Except the lawyers ignore that. They go ahead and extort money from people who, on the face of the law, it can't be applied to. First they threaten you, then they pursue you, then they keep it going for years.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's basically extortion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you Google "shakedown lawyers California," you'll get some of the history of it. The California lawyers were getting big money from foreign corporations, even outside the US, because they do business with California. California has such a big economy that they control the world.

## The Classification of Progesterone

**John Barkhausen:** When did you become aware that progesterone was going to be coming under the sights of these guys?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 10 or 15 years ago, some of the manufacturers started labeling the progesterone itself "known by California to be a carcinogen."

**John Barkhausen:** So it was already a done deal when you first heard about it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was 1987 when the California review happened. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) is what California's board is called. They weren't willing to give me the names of the people who were their "qualified experts" who made those decisions.

The law allows them to automatically list it if the World Health Organization or National Toxicology Program lists it. But in this case, they decided to have their board of qualified experts look at the relevant evidence. Out of thousands of publications on the issue of cancer and progesterone, they picked out about a dozen articles that they said were the relevant, decisive evidence.

Of those, several of them weren't even progesterone. They were birth control pills and things that contained no progesterone at all. They listed them as the relevant evidence, but when I got them to send me copies, they weren't even about progesterone in several cases. And the ones that *did* involve progesterone in the research, every one of them was totally incompetent in terms of toxicology, science, or cancer research. They were clearly manipulated to get a case against progesterone, but they failed in every case.

They had only one outside person testify during the meeting: Richard Edgren. They asked him why he had chosen to testify, and he said, "Because progesterone isn't a carcinogen." He went over some of the studies and mentioned that one of the studies using non-progesterone chemicals had produced some tumors that *weren't* metastatic. He wasn't talking about progesterone in that moment. But the chairman of the committee heard him say "metastatic," even though he had said they *weren't*. Since the topic of the meeting was progesterone—even though Edgren wasn't talking about progesterone in that case—that was the basis for making the decision. It was like the Marx Brothers. It couldn't have been sillier.

**John Barkhausen:** Or Kafka couldn't have been more surreal. You said Richard Edgren pointed out that if you call non-carcinogens carcinogens, then what's the public going to think about real carcinogens?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Exactly. You're going to ruin the whole issue of public safety if you blur anti-carcinogens with carcinogens.

One of the studies that they listed as evidence proving that progesterone is a carcinogen introduced itself by referencing some studies by Alexander Lipschutz. Lipschutz had published many papers and a book describing the anti-tumor properties of progesterone. This article referenced that and said they were checking up on Lipschutz's work. But Lipschutz, in his paper that they were referring to, had specified that progesterone given *continuously* prevents or even sometimes reverses cancer. In this paper that California considered evidence of carcinogenicity, they gave *intermittent* progesterone treatments—exactly what Lipschutz had said wouldn't prevent cancer. They concluded it doesn't prevent cancer. That paper consisted of a bad refutation of Lipschutz's evidence that progesterone prevents cancer, yet California presented this strange non-refutation as evidence that it causes cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** It's bizarre, but very effective. It sounds like nobody's going to question it because they're the experts.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All that was there was the title "Panel of Experts." It was probably the receptionist who looked up some titles that had cancer and progesterone in them.

**John Barkhausen:** And they just figured nobody's ever going to care or look into it because there's no money behind making progesterone, as you pointed out in an earlier show.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around the time that someone petitioned to take progesterone off the list, that petition was rejected because the person in charge of responding mentioned a study done at the World Health Organization Cancer Research Agency as having shown that progesterone was a carcinogen. I looked that up, and the people at the World Health Organization said they didn't know of any such thing. They looked carefully and finally found one with the same date that California had cited. It wasn't about progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** What was that about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Synthetic progesterone. California had cited that one obscure article, not about progesterone, to refute the petition that had presented evidence that progesterone protects against cancer. At the point that I asked them who made the decisions that were decisive—even though the decisions violated their own regulations—the head of the agency said, "We don't have the resources to answer your questions anymore."

**John Barkhausen:** Like, "Go away."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around the same time, someone petitioned to remove saccharin from the list of carcinogens. There is a lot of evidence that saccharin is a carcinogen. California decided to remove it from their list on the basis that the reason it causes cancer of the bladder in rats is peculiar to rat bladders—sort of a crystallization and the concussion caused by falling crystals onto the wall of the bladder. They had no evidence that it was the contact of crystals with the bladder, but they found the paper that said it does cause crystallization. However, there are also articles that showed that human urine crystallizes in exactly the same way the rats' did. So there was nothing special about the rat crystals. It was just, again, reaching as far as they could not to see the evidence. So they took it off the list because it's a big industry moneymaker.

**John Barkhausen:** So it sounds like they're there to represent certain interests and basically be a filter for what becomes available to the public based on those interests.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's their public. The corporations are the only public they're concerned with.

## Progestins vs. Progesterone

**John Barkhausen:** I recall from your newsletters that some of the tests they cited against progesterone were actually progestins. You explained last time that progestins are synthetic and often have opposite effects.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they are synthetic, but they're a different molecule. So they aren't progesterone at all. The industry got the FDA to allow them to call them progestins, even though they are good contraceptives—they prevent gestation. But because there is a change in the lining of a rabbit uterus under their influence that happens to coincide with the changes caused by progesterone in one or two features, they call a non-progestin a progestin. It's a contraceptive, but they can see one feature of overlap with progesterone, so that's the strength for calling them a progestin.

**John Barkhausen:** And for those who didn't hear the first two parts of this talk, Dr. Peat was telling us that many times progestins are prescribed and people think they're taking progesterone, but they're actually taking these different molecules.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1970, when I was working on progesterone, occasionally someone would say, "Did you see the paper in some big science magazine that progesterone causes cancer?" At that time, they were actually putting it in the title: "Progesterone Causes Cancer." But they weren't working with progesterone. Even the editors of science journals were letting them get away with calling things by false names.

By the early 70s, the science world had clarified their terminology enough so that they started consistently calling the other molecules progestins or progestogens. There has been much less scientific confusion about the terms, but medical doctors are still pretty well confused about the difference between the anti-progestational progestins and the real progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Consequently, the public is also very confused.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Natural progesterone has to carry the warning that it can cause heart defects because some of the things that are called progestins cause heart defects. Something that has one property of progesterone gets to be called a progestin, and then anything toxic that molecule does gets laid over on real progesterone. For example, women with epilepsy are told to avoid progesterone during pregnancy because it will cause heart defects. But actually, the real progesterone has been reported to prevent almost all birth defects when it's used before pregnancy.

## Academic Bias and Industry Funding

**John Barkhausen:** As we talked about in the earlier shows, most of these rulings seem to be connected to the estrogen industry. Premarin sales dropped after the Women's Health Initiative test became public, and progesterone sales were going up, which alarmed the industry.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can see it in some of the traditional centers of estrogen-promoting research; around that time, they turned against progesterone. Instead of concentrating on how good estrogen is, they're stretching to find something bad linked to progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Who is sitting on these boards?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I looked up everyone on the board. Some of them were linked to the university that was doing the anti-progesterone research. The leading anti-progesterone guy was Malcolm Pike. He and one or two others formed a company to promote a birth control pill based on his idea of protecting against progesterone. The state of California was using federal grants and other funding to support corporations, his included. So government money was flowing into his anti-progesterone business while he was sitting influential in saying that progesterone is a carcinogen.

Everyone I looked up on the board was either directly or indirectly concerned with something competing. For example, one of the people was on the board of a company promoting transdermal medical treatments—things that will administer drugs through the skin. While most of the progesterone products were being delivered through the skin, this person was representing a company that would probably be in line to market a medical progesterone transdermal.

**John Barkhausen:** What universities were they working for?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There was only one biologist on the committee and several toxicologists. The University of Southern California (USC) has, I think, the biggest concentration of anti-progesterone work. I looked at the USC website about five or six years ago and I found easily 140 references to the glorious properties of estrogen. I found numerous references to progesterone, but every one of them was about its harmful properties. If you look at them objectively, you have to look hard to find an objectively beneficial effect of estrogen, and you have to stretch very hard to find a harmful effect of progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Is the contents of this library because they've culled it, or they've just always cultivated articles with the right attitude?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things on the website were research projects in progress. They are being funded through the university, probably from pharmaceutical companies. Berkeley has more recently moved in that direction. Michigan was a big center of estrogen research and some of those people moved to UC Berkeley. Interestingly, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is involved in anti-progesterone research, which seems to have grown out of the chemical warfare line of thinking.

## The Estrogen Receptor and Scientific Dogma

**John Barkhausen:** One of the things you've written about Elwood Jensen, who is the supposed inventor of the concept of the hormone receptor. Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The idea of receptors in general was being discussed in various fields. But for estrogen, the enzymologists were progressing very quickly in understanding the effects of estrogen through the 1940s into the 1950s. One of the lines of very productive research was showing that enzymes can change estrogen back and forth between estrone and estradiol. Estrone is relatively inactive; estradiol is very active. That was classified as enzymology.

Jensen's argument was that estrogen acts by activating a genetic program. He argued it's only a female-acting substance because females are genetically determined to be female. So what estrogen does is act on a receptor that activates the genetic program. If something is acted on by enzymes, men have enzymes that are going to do the same reactions. Enzymology tended to generalize the estrogen issue and make it a masculine problem as well as female.

Jensen got the only support from the Atomic Energy Commission, which controlled the isotopes needed to do enzyme studies. He used an isotope-labeled form of estrogen and, in his experiments with uterus tissue, claimed to show that there was no oxidation or reduction of estrogen by the uterus. He said that's the end of the enzyme tradition; it's all receptor and genes now. That spread through the research world and by the mid-1960s was the dogma.

But then the enzymologists started getting the same isotopes that he had had and showed that, in fact, the old 1940s research was exactly what's happening. Now everyone knows that estrogen, estradiol, and estrone are perfectly interchangeable. That's exactly where progesterone, thyroid, and stress hormones interact with estrogen. Progesterone turns off some of the enzymes that activate estrogen and activates enzymes that inactivate estrogen.

The enzyme approach opens up the whole issue of environmental physiology—nutritional and metabolic effects on the estrogen system. But 50 years of belief in a genetic explanation of why estrogen is so good for females and harmless to everyone else persisted.

**John Barkhausen:** The reason I brought Elwood Jensen up is because you mentioned Livermore Labs and he worked in the chemical weapons industry, isn't that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** University of Chicago, I think, is where he was working. That was a big weapons laboratory. The government doesn't say much about their chemical-biological warfare research. But if you look at the careers of some of the famous biologists, you see that you can't explain their achievements other than that they were being pushed by the Pentagon to get the information that they needed for German chemical warfare.

**John Barkhausen:** So you're saying that the fact that he was able to shift the damage that estrogen does to the genetic causes removed the liability of government and industry pollution?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Until about 25 years ago, biologists thought about estrogen working on the estrogen receptor as simply activating femaleness in genetic females. As if a man didn't share practically all enzymes and genes with women. It was just an extreme case of genetic cleaning up of the dangerous possibilities.

Estrogen has been known for about 30 or 40 years to act on every kind of tissue. You can find the estrogen receptor everywhere. But even without the estrogen receptor, you can demonstrate that it works on any kind of tissue. Some of the estrogenic compounds attach to the so-called estrogen receptor, but some have estrogenic effects without touching the estrogen receptor. Really it should have a new name. It isn't really the crucial thing because you can get estrogenic effects from radiation, cyanide, suffocation, or various stresses and infections. They'll all bring on estrus, swelling of cells, and inflammation. The overlap of stress, radiation, and industrial smoke with estrogen—that's one of the things that has been carefully avoided, and the receptor idea is crucial in covering that up.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like what he came up with was a smoke and mirrors cartoon for selling a concept of how everything works in such a way that it fit in with the popular idea of the gene being how life is directed. People may be wondering why we're talking about estrogen when this is a show about progesterone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen in the physiological situation activates the production of progesterone, and then progesterone knocks down the production of estrogen. It's a matter of an occasional stimulus from stress or estrogen which turns on a system that then definitively gets rid of estrogen. It's only the exaggerated, prolonged effect of estrogen that becomes a danger.

Progesterone is the basic thing for getting rid of estrogen. If you look at the enzymes involved, progesterone inactivates the aromatase enzyme that produces estrogen from the androgens. It activates the two types of detoxifying enzymes: the glucuronide transferase and the sulfur transferase that attach sulfuric acid to make it water-soluble. Estrogen opposes those. Progesterone inactivates the estrogen-activated enzymes that remove the detoxified sulfate and glucuronide.

So it's just an amazingly comprehensive system. Systematically, it knocks out the production, maintenance, and activation of estrogen, and it even destroys the so-called estrogen receptor protein. Progesterone even protects against radiation as part of that same system because radiation imitates estrogen. The cancers produced by either radiation or estrogen are equally protected against by progesterone.

## Tamoxifen and Medical History

**John Barkhausen:** Elwood Jensen went on to try to discover other chemicals that oppose estrogen, and he came up with tamoxifen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A man named Daniel Lednicer gives a more insider view of where tamoxifen came from. The people who were working on the fact that estrogen is like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in causing not only cancer but inflammation and fibrosis were looking for anti-inflammatory things. In looking for anti-inflammatory things, they accidentally found that tamoxifen was anti-estrogen as well. Out of that line of research, according to Lednicer, even Celebrex—the COX-2 inhibiting enzymes—derived from that line of research that was thinking about a more basic view of what estrogen does. The receptor wasn't involved at all in that kind of thinking.

**John Barkhausen:** The thing I didn't understand was it's been known for a long time that progesterone does oppose estrogen. Why were they even bothering to look for something else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you have to imagine the mentality. The person Jensen said suggested looking for how the estrogen affects the tissues was Charles Huggins. Huggins founded the lab that Jensen was working in. Even though it was the University of Chicago, they were just totally unaware of the world of biochemistry as related to cancer.

Huggins is the guy that theorized that since testosterone makes a man develop a prostate gland and estrogen makes women develop breasts, if you want to stop the growth of cancer in the breast, you will either remove estrogen or give testosterone. And for the prostate, you would either castrate the man or give the man estrogen. His simple idea was that the female and male were opposite. Basically a completely idiotic idea at the time he proposed it. That immediately started doctors all over the country castrating men by the millions. For 45 or 50 years they were giving men estrogen, with or without castration, to treat prostate cancer. All on that very ignorant early 20th-century idea of opposition of the hormones.

**John Barkhausen:** I had no idea that the castration went on.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Huggins was the one who, besides proposing castrating men to cure prostate cancer and giving them estrogen, first proposed removing the ovaries to stop the estrogenic stimulation. Then, since some of them didn't recover from that, they took out their adrenal glands as another source of estrogen. That was practiced right through the 60s. At one point, Huggins even proposed treating breast cancer with estrogen. It just didn't make any sense. But he had sort of a Frankenstein mentality: let's tinker with things and maybe we'll come up with something.

## Mechanisms of Cancer and Healing

**John Barkhausen:** We only have about 10 minutes left. It would be good for people to hear about how progesterone works in combating cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Alexander Lipschutz was the person who did the most comprehensive work showing that where estrogen causes fibrosis—fibroids first and eventually cancer—it acts first on the uterus, then on the breasts, then on the lungs, kidneys, brain. It's just a matter of where estrogen concentrates that it tends to cause fibromas and cancers. In every one of those situations, progesterone was protective.

The full reason why progesterone is protective against cancer requires looking at the whole spectrum of what estrogen is doing. The first thing estrogen does is cause the cell to take up water. Taking up water stimulates cell division, fat production, and a lot of other enzyme activities. These effects happen within minutes of estrogen exposure. It takes at least several hours for genes to get activated. So obviously the receptor wasn't involved in those instantaneous effects.

Those are exactly the essence of the cancer problem. If you start an inflammation that causes cells to keep taking up water, in that stressed condition of activating cell chemistry, they're using energy faster. The stimulation of cell division tends to use up the supply of oxygen and sugar. In my thesis research, one of the things I did was show that adding estrogen to a system such as the uterus lowers the oxygen tension. It just sucks the oxygen out of the system. That stimulation creates an oxygen deficiency.

As far as sugar is available, the sugar will be glycolized to produce emergency energy. In the absence of enough oxygen to meet the stimulation, the glycolysis produces lactic acid. The production of lactic acid leaving the cell raises the pH inside the cell. That increased pH keeps the swelling going on, activates cell division, and expends energy. So it needs something from the outside to stop the production of lactic acid and deliver oxygen.

Progesterone is one of the essential things for stopping that process. But once it starts under the influence of estrogen, you get the lactic acid production, which creates the vicious cycle of cell activation. The lactic acid increases the supply of blood and spreads growth of blood vessels into the environment. It activates everything that you need to produce a tumor. All that's needed is the presence of an anti-inflammatory, energy-restoring substance such as aspirin or progesterone to stop this process.

In the simplest situation, an injury causes the lactic acid to be produced, which activates the energy changes and growth to heal the wound. But at a certain point, the system should come in with the anti-inflammatory substances to finish off the healing. In the absence of the healing, the attempt at healing simply goes on and creates this swelling and oxygen-deficient situation. If you grow cells in a culture dish and deprive them of oxygen, they will eventually mutate and form other types of cells that cause a derangement of the tissue type. So all of the steps of cancerization can be seen structurally and metabolically in terms of wound healing that can't be brought to completion.

**John Barkhausen:** I think Harry Rubin, as you've pointed out, has basically proven that cancer is not from a gene gone bad, but rather the tissue itself has developed an unhealthy state.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He has just honestly summarized the real cancer research showing that the deranged metabolism and structure is what causes the chromosomal damage. So instead of genes causing the tumor, the tumor causes the genetic defects.

**John Barkhausen:** Which is the opposite of what we hear basically every day in our popular culture.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When an oncologist or pathologist says your tissue shows abnormal cell division and the wrong number of chromosomes, they say that means we have to cut it out and irradiate you. But if you look at the fate of those deranged cells, they're going to live maybe to the next attempt to divide, then they don't have the right number of chromosomes and the halves will die. So they're very short-lived once they get to that deranged state. But the death of the cell contributes to the inflammation of the area. So stopping the inflammation and energy deficit is always the solution to the problem.

It's now recognized by some oncologists that the reason a malignant cancer reforms after they've irradiated the area or cut out the cancer is that stem cells are called into the inflamed area that has been treated. Even if you irradiate a healthy area, it will call stem cells in to try to repair the wound. Whenever you injure a tissue by removing a tumor, you're just guaranteeing that the body will try to repair the wound by sending in new cells, which then turn into cancer cells if the area is still sick.

**John Barkhausen:** So the way to actually heal or to stay healthy is to make sure that your cellular environment is a healthy one. You're saying that progesterone and aspirin are actually viable cancer treatments.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And some of the antihistamines are definitely protective. Going way back 50 years, people were seeing antihistamines would occasionally cure cancer, but that just didn't catch on in the profession.

**John Barkhausen:** Well, if people want to read more about this, they can find lots of Ray Peat's ideas at raypeat.com. We have been talking to Dr. Raymond Peat. As always, it's been a real pleasure to talk to you, Ray. Thanks so much for coming on.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Thank you.
