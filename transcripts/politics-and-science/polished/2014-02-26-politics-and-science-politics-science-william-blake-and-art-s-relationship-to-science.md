## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Welcome to Politics and Science. I am your host, John Barkhausen. This is a special edition starting an hour early with Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Peat has a PhD in biology and has specialized in physiology. Ray, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah, you're there.

**John Barkhausen:** If you could fill us in, maybe a little bit about your background would be great.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s, I started studying William Blake around 1955. I finished my master's degree at the University of Oregon with a thesis on Blake in 1959. By chance, I taught a combination of courses, mostly biology but a painting course or two, at a little college in Urbana, Ohio. Because of political things connected to anti-war and anti-atomic bomb testing, I left Urbana and started my own college in Mexico. I named it Blake College. The government shut that down in 1965.

I taught linguistics at Montana State for a year and tried to restart Blake College in Oregon. That went on for a couple of years with the FBI constantly watching the students. Then I went to graduate school in 1968 at the University of Oregon. I had been studying Blake's ideas and theory of knowledge in relation to language. I had been thinking about concentrating on brain physiology, but at the university, I found that was the most dogmatic area in the biology department other than genetics. Nerve theory was a caricature of primitive computer theory at the time. So, I found a really physiological area of biology: reproductive and aging physiology. That's what I did my thesis on. Since then, I've been following up similar ideas in the theory of knowledge, function of the brain, and how reproductive hormones affect brain function.

## Scientific Dogma and Gilbert Ling

**John Barkhausen:** A lot of your work has been collating research done over the last century. Maybe you could say a little bit about that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I ran into the biological dogmatism of the nerve people, they were basing everything on an "all or nothing" function of the nerve membrane. From the reading I had been doing and some experiments, I was very skeptical about the whole membrane control of cell biology.

Starting when I was about eight years old and read about the history of inheritance in encyclopedias, I saw there was very good evidence for the Lamarckian type of inheritance all the way through the early decades of the 20th century. It was essentially stamped out by not permitting teachers to describe the Lamarckian theory starting in 1947. Seeing that modern biology people were explaining everything in terms of genes and membranes, I looked around in the literature contemporary with what we were being assigned.

I saw that Otto Warburg had solved most of the problems of how cancer develops, for example, on the basis of damage to the respiratory energy-producing system. That was very convincing to me. People were ignoring him or denying his work had any validity without even understanding it; they always misquoted and misrepresented it.

At the same time, I ran into the work of Gilbert Ling in the early 1950s. I saw that he had demonstrated the irrelevancy of the so-called nerve membrane, or cell membrane in general. His work had basically solved all of the problems that my professors were working on and mystifying—creating problems where there weren't any. I wrote to him in the fall of 1968 and said, "You seem to have solved all of these problems that are confusing my professors." He said, "You just don't understand science. Science is about prestige, money, and power." I've written to him two or three times over the decades, and he's been very helpful each time.

**John Barkhausen:** I have his book, and it's way over my head in terms of math, but he is a brilliant man. On the face of it, his theory of how cells function makes so much more sense. I think a lot of your research, Ray, has been about environmental influences on life and countering mainstream science, which says it's all genetic and the environment has very little influence on why we get sick. Would you say that's true?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, except that I see the mainstream as having been exactly where I've been, except they got shut down financially and in publication. At the same time Lamarckism was extirpated from high schools and universities, the field theory of embryology was de-financed and disappeared, even though it was the mainstream based on sound facts.

The genetic control people—if you look at summaries of the classic papers in genetics, you see how hypothetical and rationalistic it is. It's a "it could happen" approach to science. They define themselves as a mainstream simply by shutting off publication to the dissidents. But now it's coming back. People like James Shapiro, with his bacterial demonstration of environmental and trans-generational influences, and John Cairns, another bacteria person who has kept alive the influence of the environment on inheritance. There has been a continuous environmental developmental field approach in all aspects of biology, but they've been systematically quieted.

## Politics Influencing Science

**John Barkhausen:** It seems like there are ideological reasons, but also pointed financial reasons. If the environment affects our health, it means the corporations polluting that environment are doing it at our expense.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can see that over and over; every generation has its area of concentration. The behaviorist psychologists basically defended poverty and oppression because they said what happens to the brain of the fetus in utero is purely genetically determined. So, the mother can be starved half to death, and that isn't going to hurt the offspring. The medical establishment went along with that, justifying starvation living for the poor classes.

**John Barkhausen:** Science influences public policy in an enormous way.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The only time I had an actual employment contract was from the Catholic University of Chile. Under the government in the early 70s, they were encouraged to do research on the influence of economic factors on the development of intelligence. I got a job directing a project on the influence of nutrition on brain development at the Catholic University in Valparaiso. That was part of the social change that was shut down in the coup of 1973. The whole economic intellectual environment had progressed to the point where they were interested in fetal influences and nutrition, but the American influence wiped that out with Kissinger.

**John Barkhausen:** You were there for the coup in Chile?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I didn't get there.

**John Barkhausen:** That was a terrible tragedy. Not only the loss of life and the stealing of their democracy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That happens constantly in the U.S. ever since 1947. It seems to be when it started in every field of biology and psychology.

**John Barkhausen:** You've discussed the Cold War in biology before. Who wrote that book?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carl Lindegren.

**John Barkhausen:** While we're accusing Russia of having ideology mixed with their science, we're practicing it more than anything.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the humanities were subjects of the same influences. When Blake College was shut down, I thought I would simply shift my activity to teaching linguistics. I saw that the influence of Chomsky, with Pentagon funding, had spread across the country. By the late 1960s, it was getting into essentially every department of the humanities. I taught a course through the Honors College at the University of Oregon on interdepartmental conceptions of human nature. We got speakers from ten different departments, and each of them said, "Our department's most important insight to human nature is Chomsky's generative language theory." Speaking of totalitarian cultures.

## William Blake: Art, Science, and Evolution

**John Barkhausen:** Let's get to Blake. Your thesis for your master's was called *William Blake and the Mysticisms of Sense and Nonsense*.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I concentrated on his philosophy, epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The idea that he was important in all of those areas guided my thinking in science, since it went along with what I had been learning on my own. He was putting things together, creating an image of human nature that was very different from anything that dominated our cultural institutions.

**John Barkhausen:** You were introduced to him in school?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In a world literature course when I was a sophomore. I read some of his poems and saw that his language—even though the introduction described him as a Christian mystic—had irony and complexity that was unique in my experience. One of the brightest professors of the college, Arthur Christman, let me sign up for a course just in Blake for my third year. I spent that quarter reading people who had commented on Blake, like Northrop Frye and Jacob Bronowski—who happened to be a biologist—as well as Blake's own writing.

That formed my philosophical orientation: figuring out how Blake fit in with the mainline philosophers like Kant, Hegel, Marx, Locke, and Hume. Blake had commented on several of his contemporary philosophers and pretty much ridiculed them, as he did some of the scientists. Since he worked for publishers as an engraver, he was acquainted with the authors being published. He and Henry Fuseli, the painter, illustrated Erasmus Darwin's books.

Erasmus Darwin, along with Lamarck, really was the main initiator of evolutionary thinking in biology. His grandson, Charles Darwin, sort of degraded the concept and turned it into a kind of imperialism along the lines of Malthus. Capitalism and imperialism were shaping a lot of Darwin's ideas. In a later edition, Darwin said, "Well no, I'm not exclusively saying that competition... is the only thing," and acknowledged other forms of inheritance. So, in a weak, second-handed way, he recognized that his grandfather and Lamarck did have some importance. Samuel Butler, in a couple of books, put down Charles Darwin as a phony for misrepresenting who really thought of the idea of evolution.

**John Barkhausen:** Samuel Butler said that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Samuel Butler wrote *Unconscious Memory*, which analyzed the thinking of Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck. He showed that memory and inheritance are very similar biological processes. If you look at it in terms of present biology, it would reduce to the idea that genes are always under the influence of chemical modification other than the DNA bases—they're being methylated, for example. It's a chemical and physical process that blends between memory and inheritance.

Darwin had acknowledged the idea of gemmules—something from the whole physiology affecting the inheritance—but Samuel Butler pointed out that Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck had been much more coherent in their description. It turns out that now we talk about it as epigenetic modification of the DNA, but for 150 years, the Lamarckian view sort of disappeared from the mainstream.

**John Barkhausen:** Why did everybody come down on Lamarck so much? Was it to justify the social power structure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The French institution denounced him and said he was an anti-Christian because his ideas contradicted the Bible. There was a lot of Christian theological attack during the 19th century. The current issue tries to put evolution on the side of progress and science, and put religion against all of that. But with Darwin, he became the imperialist's philosopher; "the strong winning" is the direction of progress.

At the time I started graduate school, Konrad Lorenz was about to get the Nobel Prize. There was a whole current in science justifying militarism. Konrad Lorenz was the ideologist of the Racial Hygiene Institute, justifying genocide in Germany. That was really mainline genetic thinking in America and Germany in the 20s, 30s, and 40s. The defeat of the Nazis made it embarrassing for Americans to use those terms, but by the 60s, Lorenz was being rehabilitated.

My professors were all basically committed to the same genetic determinism. You can see that tendency in Darwin—the way he considered that botanical species from England were going to displace native species in New Zealand, or the way white people were displacing brown people. He was a real imperialist racist.

William Jennings Bryan, against Clarence Darrow, was caricatured as the backwardness of people who opposed Darwinism. But the Scopes Monkey Trial occurred at the height of the eugenics domination of biological thinking. William Jennings Bryan represented the common person and anti-racial thinking, while Clarence Darrow sided with the imperialists and racists. Bryan didn't put it in the proper political language, so he's been ridiculed ever since as an ignorant person opposing progress. But when you look at who the geneticists really were—the people who set up Hitler's genocide—you see that Bryan and the Christians were really on the right side regarding human rights. Blake was at the center of all those movements that influenced American history and scientific thinking in that underground, unofficial atmosphere.

## Blake's Education and Philosophy

**John Barkhausen:** Blake is an amazingly accomplished person for somebody who never went to school from our point of view.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He went to a drawing school when he was ten, and then was apprenticed to an engraver when he was fifteen. He started associating with educated people through the engraver. As a craftsman, he wasn't at the center of their movement, but he knew these people and became friends with radicals like William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Joseph Priestley—the oxygen guy who was also a founder of Unitarianism. These people were radicals and progressives who were in danger of being imprisoned or killed by the government for their opinions.

**John Barkhausen:** Did he read science also?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. His parents attended the Swedenborgian church for a time, and Swedenborg was a real scientist who did some nerve research a hundred years prematurely. Blake knew a lot about nervous anatomy and biology. He knew all the scientists in London, at least to the extent of reading things the publishers had.

Priestley believed that matter was made up of energy. Blake saw energy as being the essence of human life. He once referred to being so inspired that sparks were coming out of his fingers. The main scientific mood of those Deists and rationalists was that reason was where attention should be put rather than on experience, and that matter was some sort of inert something without intrinsic energy. Blake was doing better thinking about the philosophy of science than even Joseph Priestley. He not only was putting energy into matter, but he wanted to see experience as a part of the nature of matter. Whether it was a piece of sand, a bug, or a person, energy and interaction were the essential properties of matter and life.

**John Barkhausen:** So it's a building aspect of matter that it actually gains complexity.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He sometimes called the principle of life or of knowing the "poetic genius." He saw this as a universal thing; a plant or an animal expressed its poetic genius through its form. It was a lively version of Spinoza's pantheism. He didn't see any separation between matter, energy, and consciousness. He believed that experience—he even said experiment—was the true form of knowing. He said the experiencing person couldn't derive anything new from previously learned knowledge. This offended the university-educated people. Blake said if you can't doubt from what you experience, you have to doubt everything people tell you is true. But experience can't be doubted because that's what it is.

## Craftsman vs. Academic Knowledge

**John Barkhausen:** We have an email question from Jose Gonzalez: "In your William Blake article, you briefly talk about the difference between the craftsman and the academic. Can you go into further detail describing the difference between them and the knowledge acquired by each one?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied etching and drypoint printmaking for a while to experience what he was doing. I saw that working on a copper plate with a needle, making fine lines to build up shapes, created a sparkly color from the refraction lines in the copper—an iridescent quality. For hours after I had been working on a plate, I would see that quality in everything I looked at.

Blake described that sort of experience: you enliven your senses by working on something. That extends to every new experience you have; you're shaping it yourself while the new stuff is coming in. The person who works only on the level of knowledge—what the book and the professor say—builds up a similar set of reflexes. They go out seeing the world in terms of what the book and the professor have said. They see the world as talking concepts to them. The craftsman feels the world in a sensory newness corresponding to how he's been using his body and mind in working.

## Visions and Imagination

**John Barkhausen:** Todd Mudd asks via email: "The first biography of William Blake by Alexander Gilchrist makes frequent mention of Blake's hallucinations and visions... What do you make of Blake's visions?"

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's that way of thinking which kids normally have, and it gets trained out of them. You can't use metaphors and imagery too much if the world around you doesn't like novel perceptions. The body has this capacity to concretize its thoughts to different extents. Most people get stuck in concretizing thoughts as words; they think of the word as the identity of the concept, and the concept as the identity of what's in the world.

If you see that your body can bring up these concrete images as you think, that gives you a much more fluid attitude towards everything you learn. You see your thought process right in front of you. The well-trained, well-educated person sees words as their consciousness, and the words tend to carry all the intentions of the educational system. That's the cage people build in their minds.

**John Barkhausen:** Do you relate that at all to Carl Jung and his idea of the unconscious and images?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. Jung was on the fringes of Freudian thinking, but I think he was closer to Blake in attitude than any of the people in that psychoanalytic culture.

**John Barkhausen:** How would you relate the psychoanalytic culture to Blake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With Freud and his superego and id, the id had to be repressed to form a rational ego. Wilhelm Reich pointed out that the superego included the Nazis—absolutely undesirable oppressors—and that the id really had most of what was good in humanity and shouldn't be repressed. Reich had sex-political organizations and got in trouble by saying people should be sexually free, combining that with socialistic political ideas. Freud pleased the authorities by saying you must repress it and accept authority. Blake, according to some biographers, was sexually a very advanced thinker and didn't believe women should be the property of their husbands.

**John Barkhausen:** Where would you fit Jung into all that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** His emphasis on imagery is very good, but he tried to stereotype it into perpetual personality types. Blake would have said that we, and worms, and everybody, have certain properties but we're always going someplace new. You can't say a person is bound to any one of these personality types.

## Matter, Spirit, and Deism

**John Barkhausen:** I wanted to read a quote from Blake's *There is No Natural Religion*: "Therefore God becomes as we are, that we may be as he is." That seems like a dangerous thing to say, implying God is created by us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Spinoza said it in a much more boring way. Spinoza was trying to get away from concretizing matter in a way that justified social hierarchy. When you separate spirit from matter, you tend to metaphorically separate working people from educated and powerful people. Plato, by putting knowledge in a world of forms, relegated human life to the material world, which was only temporal and not real.

People like Blake realized that's where the important argument is. Politics, medicine, and physics all take on an ideological attitude. In medicine, it's genetics on the cell membrane. In physics, it's a tendency to mystify the whole thing into non-experiential quantum mechanical theories. That's exactly why Blake said that when your reason—which he spelled Urizen—is separated from the body, emotions, and senses, it becomes tyrannical and stupid. He was referring to the chemists and physicists of his time letting the Deist idea of God and matter get into their thinking.

**John Barkhausen:** You referred to the Deists. Were they part of the Enlightenment movement?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They wanted to displace monarchy and social hierarchy. They kicked God out of the world and said He set it running and is no longer intervening, because the kings were claiming they were God's agents. But a lot of the Deists were rationalists who wanted to protect their property and take on the role of the monarch after they kicked out the monarch. Deism was fine for justifying a new kind of tyranny. Blake was analyzing how reason, once it throws off an old tyranny, becomes a tyrant in its place.

## Health Q&A: Ketogenic Diet

**John Barkhausen:** Let's switch to your role as a physiologist. One question is about the ketone diet. What's your opinion on this burning off of stored fat and how it affects overall health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very stressful to get in that condition. For most people, extreme hypoglycemia is needed, and that typically turns on lots of cortisol production, which has many undesirable consequences. But the worst thing is that almost everyone—the older you are, the more polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) you have built into your tissue. Those being mobilized and oxidized damage practically everything. They interfere with mitochondrial respiration but also break down and cause oxidative damage to everything outside as well as inside the mitochondria. For a 10-year-old, it's not so damaging, but for a 30 or 40-year-old, it can be really harmful.

**John Barkhausen:** Somebody used the metaphor that burning fats is like a slow-burning log and burning sugars is like burning kindling.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With a good hot fire, you don't get any smoke. Burning unsaturated fats, you get very toxic smoke. Cigarette smoke contains acrolein, for example. Polyunsaturated fats break down into these toxins similar to what you get in smoke. So it's a good metaphor: you don't want a slow, smoky, toxic fire.

## Health Q&A: Heart Arrhythmias

**John Barkhausen:** Heart arrhythmias, Afib, and tachycardia—what are the causes and solutions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One recognized factor is that the blood is usually more viscous than normal, making it slower to refill after the stroke. That viscosity and discrepancy between pressure going out and coming in tends to give complex signals to the heart.

The things you eat chronically, as well as hormonal balance, affect the sensitivity of the heart. Nerve impulses are affected by the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and opposing steroids like estrogen versus progesterone and testosterone. High estrogen increases sensitivity and the likelihood to contract. Progesterone desensitizes the heart so it can build up a bigger charge of blood and have a bigger stroke before it fires.

Too much of the adrenergic side will make it oversensitive and tend to have premature contractions. Too much of the cholinergic side can simply stop the heart. The thyroid sensitizes you to the sympathetic side. If you take thyroid suddenly when you've been hypothyroid, you can get tachycardia. A person's liver governs the way the thyroid is working, so a person with liver problems can have periodic episodes of tachycardia. Combinations of high estrogen and low thyroid are very dangerous for the heart.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds difficult to get right.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you do things gradually. Estrogen has to be kept under control because, as well as exciting nerves, it increases the tendency to clot. Getting your estrogen/progesterone balance right is probably the basic thing to work on, since progesterone has a digitalis-like effect of increasing stroke volume, making the heart work more efficiently with fewer beats.

## Physics: Quantum Mechanics and Redshift

**John Barkhausen:** A listener writes: "I am a bit confused about Ray's statements about modern quantum physics... I think it is important to distinguish between the mathematical formalism and the more or less deceptive interpretation of Heisenberg and others."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's important to look around and see the many different interpretations of the slit experiment. The prediction is there, but the interpretation is the whole thing. The problem wouldn't exist except for Einstein and people of his generation making a very mistaken basic assumption: that matter is entirely local, atomic, and has no field properties extending electrically beyond individual atomic interactions.

From that peculiar atomic granular nature of matter, to produce the photoelectric effect, light also had to be granular to act locally. It's purely derived from assumptions which just 15 years later turned out not to be true. Michael Polanyi proposed an adsorption isotherm that was very simple, empirical, and not compatible with Einstein's granular theory. Through the 20s, Polanyi's work on crystals and metals tended to indicate a non-local nature of energy.

If matter has a wave-like behavior, you can explain photoelectric processes in terms of one wave interacting with another—a sort of tuning of waves in light and matter—rather than imagining a granular nature of light. The assumptions are so important to the quantum people that they don't like critics saying the assumptions have to be re-examined.

**John Barkhausen:** Michael Polanyi was ridiculed by them, wasn't he?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. He was so affected by the reaction of established physicists that even when he became a physics professor, he wouldn't teach his students the true Polanyi isotherm; he taught the Langmuir monolayer isotherm.

Halton Arp is another example. He was making photographs showing galaxies with stringers of matter between them, showing a connectedness of substance. But the galaxies had a very great redshift difference, showing they should be moving at extremely different velocities. He was denied use of the telescopes because the pictures so strongly made fun of the belief in the expanding universe explanation for the redshift.

**John Barkhausen:** What does the redshift mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's interpreted like the Doppler effect of sound—pitch drops as a vehicle moves away. When you get evidence that is embarrassing to committed assumptions, you have to stop the person providing the evidence.

Once my physiology professor came up behind me to see how my nerve setup was going. I showed him that as the microelectrode entered the cell, the voltage went up properly. I said, "Now notice as it penetrates to the other side of the cell, you get a dip, a rise, a dip, and another rise." He recognized that violated his whole doctrine of cell voltage. He just turned around and never spoke to me again.

## Health Q&A: Neuropathy

**John Barkhausen:** What is extremity numbness, like in fingers, indicative of?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's common in diabetes, but often happens years before blood sugar becomes diabetic. In the case of one hand, it can be a tunnel syndrome where the nerve gets squeezed because connective tissue swells up. If that happens during the night, that's very common in anyone who has a slight hormonal imbalance away from good oxidative metabolism, causing tissues to take up water. Many people scheduled for carpal tunnel surgery have completely relieved the problem just by taking thyroid or pregnenolone.

Standard medical opinion blames it on sugar, but research connects it to toxins, endotoxin from the intestine, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide. It was recognized about 25 years ago that the brain is a major steroid organ—producing neurosteroids like progesterone and DHEA. Just recently, people are recognizing that peripheral nerves also have their nerve steroids and are just as dependent as the brain on the right balance of estrogen and progesterone.

## Health Q&A: Electrolytes and Adrenals

**John Barkhausen:** Can you explain the role of electrolytes in fluid balance and their relationship to adrenal fatigue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The medical dogma is that cells have pumps in their membranes that regulate balance. Gilbert Ling's work shows that the pump concept is irrational. His explanation is that the cytoplasm—the whole cell substance—is like an ion exchange resin.

When the cell substance is acidified, it prefers potassium. If the cell pH rises, the electron concentration increases, and the sodium atom is preferred. The main thing determining the acidic pH in a healthy cell is the oxidation of fuel producing carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is an acid. As it leaves the cell, it takes ions with it.

If you slow down the production of CO2 and ATP, the pH rises. Lactic acid is formed, and in leaving the cell, it takes protons out, making the cell more alkaline. That alkaline condition prefers sodium. Any shift that increases alkalinity will make that cell take up water, hydrating the gel.

In a low thyroid state, every cell tends to take up sodium and calcium and lose potassium and magnesium. The condition of being low thyroid means you lose sodium because you can't put it back into the bloodstream from the urine. A low thyroid person will tend to put more sodium into the urine, making their blood dilute, which leads to swelling of the tissues. But the swelling really started back in the cell which became alkaline.

**John Barkhausen:** So taking thyroid or increasing salt intake would help?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, salt will help the low thyroid person. When you lose too much sodium, aldosterone increases in the adrenal. That tends to exchange magnesium loss for sodium loss. Increasing aldosterone has hormonal effects, shifting the parasympathetic balance and causing inflammation. Heart failure almost always involves too much effective aldosterone.

## Health Q&A: Mitochondrial Repair

**John Barkhausen:** If the cell gets damaged in the mitochondria—for example, too much calcium or PUFAs—does it die? Can the body make new cells to sustain energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The mitochondria themselves can be repaired and induced to multiply in an individual damaged cell. A dying cell can be replaced from stem cells or adjoining cells given the proper conditions.

There was a demonstration of old people whose muscle mitochondria lacked the necessary DNA for proper function. By having them do concentric weightlifting—not the kind that stretches the muscle, but only has weight when the muscle is contracting—they were able to find new mitochondria in their muscle cells with all the proper DNA within a few weeks. Something as simple as concentric exercise can restore old and damaged cells.

There were experiments taking samples from people's facial skin, finding mutated damaged cells from sun exposure. When they kept the skin completely covered for several weeks, the mutated cells disappeared. Stem cells had taken over and replaced them with good cells. Stopping the continuing damage and giving the cell the necessary stimulation will repair things. I've seen people come out of dementia and epilepsy and far-advanced cases.

**John Barkhausen:** That's really hopeful, Ray. Thank you so much for being on today.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.
