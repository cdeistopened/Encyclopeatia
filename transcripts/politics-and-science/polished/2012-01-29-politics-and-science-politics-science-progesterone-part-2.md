## Introduction

**John Barkhausen:** Welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhausen, and I'm very happy that Dr. Raymond Peat is returning to the show. This is a follow-up show about progesterone from the one we did last week. For those who don't know, Ray Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialty in physiology, and he's done extensive research in the fields of endocrinology and science history.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been reading in both of those areas since I was about 14 or 15 years old.

**John Barkhausen:** You mentioned before that when you were a little kid you were reading the *Little Blue Books*. When did you first encounter Kropotkin? This is completely unrelated to our topic, but I was curious about that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Besides the *Little Blue Books*, he was the first really political argument I read. His book on cooperation in animals as a basis for his anarchy theory—I think I was 14 when I found that at the library. That shaped my thinking both in politics and in biology.

## Progesterone Safety and Anesthetic Effects

**John Barkhausen:** Back to the subject of progesterone. We left off last week talking about the *Wall Street Journal* article regarding a doctor who had done research on the effect of progesterone on brain damage through accidents and strokes. He found it a very effective therapy; people recovered twice as fast, and there were no negative side effects.

I asked you last week about any negative side effects you knew about progesterone, and you mentioned the danger of being over-anesthetized by it. Is that a danger of actually stopping your heart if you took too much, or is that just a risk of getting into an accident if you fell asleep?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think what it would do first is stop breathing, but up to a certain point, it stimulates breathing. It's probably somewhat of an antidote to things like morphine because progesterone, as long as it's within several hundred milligrams at a time or per day, is like an imitation of pregnancy, where it stimulates breathing.

However, up in the pharmacological range of 3,000 or 4,000 milligrams all at once, instead of being a stimulant to respiration, it just puts everything to sleep. I think that would include the respiratory system at some very high level.

In Mexico, some students were experimenting with the idea that maybe progesterone works like morphine because of those sedative effects. They combined naloxone, the anti-morphine drug, with progesterone, and their experimental rat died. It was okay on a given amount of either of them alone. That pretty much said that progesterone isn't acting like morphine, because the anti-morphine chemical seemed to exaggerate the anesthetic effect of progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Is it the equivalent of saying that maybe water supports life, but if you drink too much of it, it can potentially kill you? What's the range of the dose we're talking about for overdosing on progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one really has done that. My students' rat was the only death that I know of, even experimentally. In the 1940s, Hans Selye told his technicians to experiment with very big doses of progesterone. After doing some experiments, they said those high doses had killed the rats. He didn't believe it. He said, "What did you do with them?" They went to the garbage and fished them out. He published photographs holding them by the skin on their back; they looked sort of like a wet dish rag. Just the most relaxed rat you ever saw. But they weren't dead. They were just deeply sleepy. His technicians had thought they died. So, I'm not even sure that my students were not mistaken about the naloxone and progesterone combination, but they *thought* the rat had died.

**John Barkhausen:** I see. So it's only potentially fatal in enormous quantities.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Progesterone in Men: Vasectomies and Fertility

**John Barkhausen:** You also said that vasectomies in men tended to lower progesterone. What's the mechanism behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It wasn't consistent. When men had very distinct symptoms following vasectomies, they studied what was going on and found that the ones who had the symptoms had very low to almost zero progesterone. They recovered when they gave them progesterone. However, most of the men having vasectomies didn't have any symptoms.

My interpretation is that it's a biological analog to what's reasonable in the female. If the female has an infection in the uterus or tubes, for example, it's biologically reasonable to turn off progesterone production so that pregnancy can't happen. Irritation in the uterus or tube in the female causes sterility by turning off progesterone and increasing estrogen. I think the event in the man who had the bad reaction to vasectomy was the biological equivalent of a signal traveling up the ducts, probably to the testicle, maybe to the pituitary, turning off steroid production.

**John Barkhausen:** It's interesting that these hormones seem very complicated. When we try to name them by one purpose, it gets confusing. We think of progesterone as the female fertility hormone, but men are actually producing it in their testicles or pituitary. And the negative effects they were experiencing from their vasectomies—wasn't impotence one of the negative effects?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I've seen several men—I don't remember whether they had vasectomies or not—who were suffering from impotency. It was immediately resolved by taking very small doses of progesterone a couple of times. It's sort of like priming the pump. Progesterone has a positive feedback loop, apparently in men as well as in women.

People have experimented with slices of either ovary tissue or adrenal tissue, which makes some progesterone. They found in both cases that if you add a little bit of progesterone, it increases the organ's production of progesterone. That is positive feedback, which is unusual in hormone regulation.

**John Barkhausen:** That indicates to me that the body doesn't see it as something you can get too much of.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From that kind of engineering, you would think that the body believes that more is always better. In the case of progesterone, it seems to be what happens in pregnancy. If a person is having some biological problem where their progesterone drops off and they start bleeding during the pregnancy, there have been studies where they would give one shot of progesterone early in the pregnancy. These were women who habitually miscarried or had monthly bleeding throughout the pregnancy and delivered prematurely.

I think two-thirds of the women maintained full, increasing production every week, higher than the preceding week, until they had a normal nine-month delivery. Another 30% required a second injection several weeks later, and they too went back to full production. There was a small group which didn't recover so completely.

## Animal Research and Pharmaceutical Bias

**John Barkhausen:** I know a lot of people are going in for fertility therapy in this day and age. Does progesterone still play a big role in modern fertility therapies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but very few of the clinics that specialize in that really understand. If they would read more animal research, they would understand people better. But there's really a medical bias against endocrine science based on animals.

**John Barkhausen:** Why is that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the marketing has done it through 40 or 50 years. The estrogen industry said, "Don't pay any attention to the fact that estrogen causes clotting, heart attacks, cancer, brain damage, and so on. That's just in animals. It has just the opposite effects in humans."

**John Barkhausen:** That's interesting. It does seem that they've thrown out a lot of the earlier research that you write about from the early 20th century.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When the industry wants to sell something that they can't demonstrate in humans, then they will base the whole thing on animal experiments. Like the osteoporosis issue—they found there was no evidence they could demonstrate bone improvement with estrogen in people. So they looked around at different animals. They tried it on beagle dogs and found that it caused *more* osteoporosis in dogs. So they forgot about that.

They looked around and found that in rodents, it could seem to cause increased bone strength. But it happens that in rodents, even cortisol can increase bone strength. There are some situations, like prolactin in rats, which will increase progesterone, whereas in humans it generally decreases it. If you look at the interactions, it's really all the same principles that apply in people, but rodents are generally nocturnal animals and we aren't. You have to take into account what time of day you give the injections because you're either intensifying or weakening their normal rhythms. By using animals with an upside-down rhythm compared to humans, you can sometimes get very nice upside-down results.

**John Barkhausen:** You're saying that the pharmaceutical companies paying for these studies are actually engineering them that way on purpose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. They like rat experiments when they can be arranged to sell a product, but they want to forget completely about the dog experiments which caused only bad effects.

## Tubal Ligation and IUDs

**John Barkhausen:** Going back to estrogen and progesterone, I was curious if there's any effect on estrogen or progesterone production when somebody gets a tubal ligation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right at the same time that the impotency experiment saw that in men, another group saw exactly that effect in the result of the tubal ligation within just a month or two of that publication. That really helped to explain how IUDs work. Animal experiments had been demonstrating for years that if you want to have the animal become infertile, you just put a little suture in the uterus. That's usually all it takes. The signal travels up from the slightly injured uterus to turn off the ovary's progesterone production. Injuring the tubes does the same thing—not always, but often.

**John Barkhausen:** So that could lead to a progesterone deficiency in somebody who's either had an IUD or a tubal ligation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Medical Attitudes and History

**John Barkhausen:** Let's pick up where we left off in your life's path. You were teaching at naturopathic colleges after getting your PhD, and you had decided to start recommending progesterone use to some of your nutritional patients.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was teaching endocrinology at the Naturopath School, but I was doing mostly nutritional counseling at home. I found that it involved more and more hormone interactions with the foods. When I saw two or three women with such absolute recoveries from just small amounts of progesterone, I realized that I would basically be injuring people if I didn't give them the true information that I knew about in animals and was starting to see in humans.

Over a period of two or three years in Eugene, I had spoken to enough women about the effects of thyroid and progesterone on their symptoms that the local gynecologists turned 180 degrees in their practice. There were so many dozens of their patients saying that they wouldn't take estrogen and insisted on getting a prescription for progesterone or thyroid. It took a couple of years, and doctors saw that their business was being affected, so they totally reversed their practices. That went on until those doctors retired. Then I think the pressure from the industry and profession probably reverted the situation.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like those doctors were pretty open-minded.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, very, very closed-minded. It was a terrible experience for the first dozen or so women who went to them. Just awful personal attacks. The doctors would tell the patients not to come back because they had "personality defects" if they wouldn't accept their advice.

**John Barkhausen:** Oh dear. We're talking about the late 70s and early 80s at this point?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, between '76 and '82.

**John Barkhausen:** I have a quote here from the report you referred to last time by Carla Rothenberg, which is available on the web. She wrote a report when she was at Harvard about the history of hormone replacement in this country.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Barbara Seaman was my contemporary in studying estrogen and progesterone, and she wrote a lot of good stuff. *Women and the Crisis in Sex Hormones* was one of her titles. She was very good at debating; by knowing a thousand times more, when she got the opportunity to debate someone from Yale Medical School, for example, they ended up looking like complete ignoramuses. She was very influential against estrogen and for progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Here's the ad campaign for hormone replacement therapy back in the 50s and 60s. An ad for Hoffman-La Roche's Menrium says:

> "His wife has a lot of different menopausal symptoms, but only a few really irritate him. Her hot flashes, her vertigo, her palpitations, that's her problem. What really bothers him is her nervousness, her irritability, and her excessive anxiety, often expressed by endless book shuffling, chain smoking, and reading lamp insomnia. Menrium takes care of the vasomotor symptoms as well as the emotional symptoms. This means the symptoms that bother his wife the most and the symptoms that irritate him the most."

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Barbara Seaman went over advertising and public relations very thoroughly. At one point she mentioned that Hitler had tested estrogen on people in the prison camps as a way to make them meek and submissive. She thought that was probably—if you put it in context with an advertisement like the one you read—a way to make a more obedient, servile wife.

## Developing a Progesterone Product

**John Barkhausen:** You were helping people find out about progesterone. At some point, you patented a progesterone formulation, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A woman who lectured in my class, who had MS and optic neuritis, was using exclusively injectable progesterone. She was getting really big amounts of benzyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic. Hans Selye called it the "catatoxic" effect of progesterone and pregnenolone—that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them. Progesterone's anti-toxic effect is so great that people were benefiting from these injections despite the vegetable oil and toxic solvent.

Sometimes, if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was a micronized solution in water. But if they injected that in the hip, for example, the particle would cause irritation that destroyed fat cells, leaving a dent. Those "water-wettable" solutions weren't just progesterone; there was a carbohydrate-like molecule attached to the progesterone particle, making it wettable. Those particles are toxic.

Knowing about the problems with injection and the medical indoctrination that stomach acid destroys progesterone—even though the manufacturing involves boiling the steroid in acid, so your stomach couldn't make a dent in it—I decided to try something else. Since I had noticed that I could taste progesterone just by sticking my hand in the powder, I decided that if I could get doctors to use it on the skin, that would let them see what it really does.

On the first experiments, I would heat it in olive oil to get a high concentration. The olive oil would bring their blood levels up to a perfectly normal amount in less than an hour. I was thinking about old research in Italy explaining why vitamin E would protect against the sterility-producing effects of estrogen. They explained vitamin E's action as being a "progesterone sparer."

It made me think about what vitamin E is doing in the mitochondrion where progesterone is produced. I realized that for them to both act in and be produced in the mitochondrion, they have to be compatible in solubility. So I dropped some progesterone powder in vitamin E and saw that I could get a 50/50 solution with a very pure form of vitamin E. They were absolutely inter-soluble.

That was a compact, stable way to get doctors to start using transdermal progesterone. I told them about the effect in olive oil, but no one wanted to heat the solution up every time they applied it. With vitamin E, you could get a stable 5, 10, or 20% solution convenient to rub into the skin.

**John Barkhausen:** So even when it's dissolved in vitamin E, you don't have to heat it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You don't have to get it hot, just warming it so that it's thin enough to stir. Just stirring it at room temperature will do it.

## Absorption: Skin vs. Oral

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** However, you only absorb maybe 10% or 20% at best when you rub it into the skin. So after doctors were willing to prescribe it for their patients using it on the skin, I pointed out to them that they could take it orally and save about 80% of the cost.

**John Barkhausen:** Why is only 20% absorbed through the skin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It binds to the skin. As cells mature and prepare to shed, they collapse. Keratin fibers—protein that makes up part of the structure of the cell—are cross-linked and become a semi-tanned, hardened barrier to water. But they bind oil, so the oils in your skin link to these cross-linked keratin proteins and make a raincoat effect, closing off the surface to water. Those also bind progesterone very strongly. The progesterone will saturate those, and some of it passes on and gets into your deeper tissues, but a good part of it sticks on these superficial barrier cells and is then shed.

**John Barkhausen:** So it might be good for your skin, but if you're trying to get it in further, it's less efficient.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's more economical just to take it orally because when it's dissolved in oil, and you eat fat in your diet, your bile emulsifies it. It breaks down into very small particles about the size of a bacterium, called chylomicrons. These pass through intestinal cells into the lymphatic ducts—called lacteals because the absorbed fat particles give it a milky look. From there, it goes right into the bloodstream as little fat globules that circulate.

If you eat powdered progesterone, the cells of your intestine have the same enzymes that the liver has for adding sugar to hormone molecules and making them water-soluble. So when the crystalline progesterone hits your intestine cells directly, a lot of it is processed just as it would be in the liver. You lose a big part of your progesterone if you take it in the crystalline form. But when it's in the fat globule form, it bypasses the liver because it's taken up as these nutritional fat particles. Basically, something like 99% of it gets into your circulation quickly when you eat it in the oil form.

**John Barkhausen:** And it would be distributed in the same proportion that your circulation works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Everywhere red blood cells go, these chylomicrons will circulate a few times.

## Patents and the FDA

**John Barkhausen:** When did you decide to patent it and what was your thinking on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was constantly submitting articles to medical and science journals, and medical journals didn't want to have anything to do with it because they were doing business with the estrogen industry. Since I couldn't get anything published, I was having to give talks up and down the West Coast. I wanted to get the information out and figured that publishing it as a patent would be the only way I could get it on the record and openly distributed.

**John Barkhausen:** Was it difficult getting the patent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. I wrote up the whole story and sent it in. The patent examiner, talking to me through a lawyer, said, "You can't say anything about cancer if you want to get the patent to issue." He said that's a standard rule; the only thing they really are concerned about regarding accuracy is a cancer claim. So I just deleted the things I said about what I had seen it do to cancer, and it went right through.

**John Barkhausen:** What is that prejudice against cancer claims?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just that it would be used as a marketing tool by the cancer industry. You can claim perpetual motion, free energy, all kinds of things in a patent—there are thousands of those crazy patents—but they have some standards regarding cancer.

**John Barkhausen:** Once you patented it, did you figure out some way to make it available to people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was mixing up some myself and selling it. John Lee, for example, was one of the first people who started buying my mixture. I tried to get various people to manufacture it over the years. I talked to all the big drug companies. They said, "No thanks."

About a year or two later, those drug companies came on the market with crystalline progesterone mixed with oil as they saw there was increasing interest. But probably my having the patent on vitamin E as a solvent prevented them from messing with that, even though it was the economically effective way. They would mix it with things like peanut oil.

**John Barkhausen:** That sounds rather toxic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, and it's not a very good solvent.

**John Barkhausen:** Did you manage to set up your own production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First I tried to get someone I had worked for in nutrition counseling. He got interested and dealt with the FDA, and we got a cream form available. Then he kept making it cheaper by buying things that weren't quite progesterone or weren't quite vitamin E. I wasn't connected with it after 1979.

Then I got friends to gradually develop their own business. Seeing what this other person had done with the FDA and how it's basically a crony system, I suggested that they just sell it to the doctors who were already interested. Those doctors would tell their friends. So there was never anything said about the product by the people who took it over. It wasn't necessary to ever say anything about its medical effects.

**John Barkhausen:** So basically you didn't make any claims.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. When I was dealing with the FDA at various times, they looked at my books and said, "Those are federal crimes because you have a patent." They didn't prosecute me for writing the books, but they said that I couldn't say anything good about progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** Even in your books, you couldn't say anything about it, even though it's not attached to the actual vial of progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. I asked them if they would put that in writing just because it seemed so ridiculous, and they said no. That's standard policy. They can be very nice people on the telephone, and then they talk to the lawyers and act like thugs when they put anything in writing.

## The War on Progesterone

**John Barkhausen:** I know when I first started looking for progesterone, I was able to find it in places like Vitamin Express. They were carrying "Dr. Ray Peat's Progest-E." At what point did you start managing to get it into some stores?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They got that out of John Lee's books. That's where they attached my name to it, which they weren't supposed to do. But John Lee described it as "Ray Peat's Progesterone," and so that's what the customers wanted. These places attached my name to it even though I hadn't been involved with it for 15 years at that time.

**John Barkhausen:** How is it sold under FDA supervision?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1991, I talked to a man at FDA headquarters in Bethesda who described himself as the head of the drug division. He said he had just read an internal historical article stating that in 1941, when they were getting around to enforcing the 1937 Food and Drug Act, they had a meeting in which they decided they would not take authority over natural hormones. He said, "I have it right here on my desk. I'll send you a copy when I can find it."

Months later, I got a letter, apparently written by his lawyers, which didn't mention that article at all. Under the Freedom of Information Act, I tried to get a copy of that meeting. After a very long time, I got some edited pages that cut off right at the point where they were going to say that.

**John Barkhausen:** It sounds like they want to take over the authority to regulate hormones. Is that what's going on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and another study announced that estrogen causes dementia, heart attacks, strokes, deep vein clots, lung embolisms, and such. The Premarin and Prempro industry sales went from over $2 billion down to a little over $1 billion over a period of about three years. That really got their attention.

They saw that progesterone sales had gone from a few tons a year up to many tons over just a few years as estrogen sales were falling. In 2005, Wyeth petitioned the FDA to prosecute pharmacists who were preparing natural progesterone. A little later, the FDA sent out letters telling pharmacists to stop making any claim for progesterone.

Also in 2005, lawsuits against progesterone started. A women's law group had a $300,000 donation—the source of which they wouldn't reveal—to claim that progesterone was causing breast cancer. They sued something like 60 companies that were selling topical progesterone. I think most of them just stopped selling it.

**John Barkhausen:** So they're going after progesterone in response to these studies blaming estrogen for serious health problems. What's the logic there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They saw the tremendous increase in progesterone sales exactly at the same time their estrogen sales were falling. It was obvious that women were shifting their menopause treatment from estrogen to progesterone. A 2009 lawsuit revealed that tens of millions of dollars were being spent by Wyeth to basically bribe doctors, medical journals, and researchers to say that estrogen is really the thing they should be using.

Looking at the University of Southern California, one of the schools that has published most of the anti-progesterone stuff since that WHI study, I looked up "estrogen" on their website and found about 150 items indicating how good estrogen was. Looking up "progesterone," I couldn't find a single article saying anything good about it.

Really, it wasn't estrogen alone that was causing those cancers in the WHI study; it was a combination with a synthetic progestin. That links into the need to attack progesterone.

**John Barkhausen:** I see. They found it's basically a scapegoat by blaming progesterone for the problems of estrogen and the synthetic progestins.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And that shows up in the whole history of how progesterone is labeled by pressure on the FDA. They found that the synthetic progestins were toxic and caused heart defects in babies. So the natural progesterone has to bear the label that it might cause birth defects, even though it's a completely different substance having completely opposite effects. It carries the label of these so-called progestins.

**John Barkhausen:** Labeling is a very powerful tool. Ray, we've come to the end of the hour. We still haven't gotten to the meat of what happened with progesterone under California law. Would you be willing to do a part three show to follow up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The article on my website really covers it, but I don't know very much about what has happened since I wrote that article about five years ago.

**John Barkhausen:** I think your case regarding progesterone and the details of what happened in California is very illustrative of how our public health policy is going. Thanks so much for being on Politics and Science today. You can find out a lot more about Dr. Raymond Peat at **raypeat.com**. Thank you very much, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks. You too. Bye.
