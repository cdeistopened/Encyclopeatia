## Introduction

**Host:** It might be a wonderful world for you if you listen to our guest, Dr. Raymond Peat. Aloha, Dr. Peat, how are you today?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hello. Very good.

**Host:** We're thrilled to have you on our show. All week long, Karen and I have been telling people in our store that you're going to be our guest. Everybody loves your books. I understand you started working with hormones and progesterone back in 1968. I'm curious, what caused you to get into this field?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been teaching linguistics and painting alternately, but I had been interested in science from childhood. I saw medical "science" going off in very perverse directions through the 1950s. I didn't think of going to university graduate school in biology because my bad experience in high school biology—with very retarded textbooks—made me think there wasn't much science in the biological field. Finally, I decided that I needed to use laboratory instruments that were too expensive to get myself. So, I enrolled in graduate school and figured that just by not arguing with the teachers, I could get through the program and use the lab, which I did.

**Karen:** Your insight always amazes me because I'm one of those gullible believers. When I am told that I should take estrogen because I'm aging, I believed it. In fact, I was writing a dissertation on the positive benefits of estrogen until I met you. It blew all that stuff right out of the water. I look back at how gullible I was and how easily people are misled into believing what the pharmaceutical industries want them to believe.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Advertising is very powerful. A group of 13 estrogen companies got together in 1942 when it was already known that estrogen caused miscarriages, sterility, cancer, seizures, and so on. But they had a product and they wanted to sell it as the "female hormone," even though it's also a male hormone. They got together and, with advertising and political pressure, convinced the FDA to approve the use of estrogen to prevent miscarriages—which it actually caused. By advertising, they got the public interested in estrogen as an anti-aging hormone. So, it started really with a definite conspiracy of 13 companies in 1942.

## Estrogen Metabolism and Ratios

**Karen:** It has continued to this day, even with well-meaning individuals like Suzanne Somers, who advocates the use of bioidentical hormones. She always throws large amounts of estrogen into the equation, including estriol. Would you mind talking about that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body has many protective systems for inactivating the strong estrogen, estradiol. It has enzymes to oxidize it in different ways. By oxidizing it to estriol or estrone, it reduces the estrogen-like activity. It also has several other systems for destroying estrogen efficiently. If your metabolism is working very well, estrogen should be totally eliminated about 12 hours following ovulation and implantation. It should be disposed of thoroughly within a few days of ovulation.

**Host:** I'm amazed that having worked in the natural foods industry for 42 years, when I read my trade magazines, I'm still seeing advertisements for estrogen-based products. It's not only in the pharmaceutical industry; it's in the natural foods industry.

**Karen:** But it's not that estrogen is bad, right? It's that it needs to be in a certain ratio.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've been thinking of how common estrogen is throughout the universe. Anytime an organism is injured, it produces estrogen, which stimulates growth and repair. But an even more common biological material is ATP, the so-called energy molecule. Anytime we're injured, or even when a cell is slightly stressed, it loses some of its ATP, which acts as a signal to other cells to repair the damage. When a lizard is attacked and drops its tail, it's probably a surge of ATP that cuts the tail off. ATP forms to make a blister, dissolving the tissue between the layers of skin so that fluid flows in. ATP, our most life-supporting basic molecule, has these potentially deadly, destructive effects—cutting off and dissolving tissue so that repair can take place.

Estrogen is just supposed to be biologically active as an excitant at an early stage of injury. For example, it slightly inflames the uterus to cause the growth of cells, preparing a place for the embryo to implant. But if the estrogen stays present too long, it kills the embryo by over-exciting the surrounding cells.

In the 1950s, my thesis advisor, Soderwall, demonstrated that by giving an estrogen supplement to a pregnant animal the day that it becomes pregnant, you can prevent implantation by a small amount, such as is used in birth control pills. That's how they work: by a quick abortion actually, rather than preventing conception. He found that on the second, third, or fourth days following implantation, if you gave just slightly larger amounts of estrogen all the way up until delivery, you could kill the embryo or the fetus, despite adjusting the dose of estrogen to counteract the increasing progesterone. So at any stage, estrogen produces abortion when it is out of balance with progesterone.

**Karen:** If a woman is pregnant and the progesterone levels don't increase?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When a woman has a sluggish liver or low thyroid, so that her estrogen is chronically too high or her progesterone is chronically low, she will often bleed every month, several months into the pregnancy, as if she were menstruating. During any of those cyclic surges of estrogen, miscarriages are most likely to happen.

## Estrogen, Pollution, and Sexual Differentiation

**Karen:** How would this affect the sexual persuasion of the child should that pregnancy make it all the way to the end? How would being bathed in a more highly estrogenic environment affect the child?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It damages sexual differentiation. There is some research that prenatal stress causes an intersexual differentiation.

**Karen:** What does that mean exactly?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not definitely either one.

**Karen:** How would that show up with sexual organs? Does that mean you would have hermaphroditism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main thing is that the male has smaller genitals, and the distance between the genitals and the anus is decreased in proportion to the estrogen exposure.

**Karen:** Would that affect a more transgender society?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they're seeing the distance that characterizes the estrogen exposure of male genitals decreasing in recent decades in polluted countries.

**Karen:** So would you say that when people say, "I was born this way"—as in men who are gay, women who are lesbian—they truly are born this way due to this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sure. I think that's a big part of it. You can see it in crocodiles, alligators, ocean otters, fish, and frogs. Everyone is affected by the estrogen pollution.

## Radiation, Mad Cow, and Military Cover-ups

**Karen:** It's amazing that you pointed out some things that no one would ever consider to have an estrogenic effect, such as X-rays and radiation. I'd like your feeling on the Fukushima radiation. Do you think that's gone away and is harmless?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Did you read about the dairy cow that turned out to be infected with so-called Spongiform Encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease)?

**Karen:** I did. I was curious what your take on that would be.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I suspect that it's exposure to the Japanese radiation of the animals in California. The breakout of Mad Cow Disease in England was in the area where Chernobyl radiation rained down on the pastures. It followed in the years immediately following Chernobyl exposure.

**Karen:** Who came up with the lies about the sheep offal causing it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Pentagon was doing that in the 1940s following the atomic bomb, and in the 1950s with the hydrogen bomb. When the fallout from the hydrogen bomb drifted across the islands, they sent Carleton Gajdusek. He was a pediatrician posing as a virologist, sent by the military to an area that had been exposed to hydrogen bomb fallout to study what supposedly was a traditional brain disease, Kuru. He claimed it had been passed on for generations by cannibalism.

Actually, it was never reported before the hydrogen bomb fallout. In a miraculously short time, he identified what he claimed was a new "slow virus" and got the Nobel Prize for discovering a virus that probably doesn't exist. The whole thing was a military cover-up. He was not a virologist, didn't know anything about it, and didn't do the kind of research that could have identified it. The same symptoms can be produced by radiation.

## Protecting Against Radiation: Progesterone and Vitamin A

**Karen:** Is there anything we can do to protect ourselves from this radiation from Fukushima or X-rays? Every time I go to the dentist, he insists I must have an X-ray. Is there anything we can do to offset any damage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Two or three papers were published—I discussed them in my radiation newsletter a year ago—showing that estrogen was synergistic with radiation in causing cancer. The same way that progesterone blocks cancer produced by estrogen, it also blocks cancer produced by radiation.

**Karen:** So if someone knew they had a history of many diagnostic X-rays, one way they could prevent long-term effects is to start using progesterone on a regular basis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I think in the long term that is protective. They know that when they do the so-called Gamma Knife brain treatment, the symptoms of nerve cell degeneration aren't seen for usually more than 18 months, sometimes several years later. These cells stay in an inflamed condition. Like they've seen in blood serum 20 years after Chernobyl or 50 years after the Japanese bomb exposures, there is a chronically inflamed condition that shows up decades after exposure. I think that can be reversed even at a late date so that the chronic inflammatory state doesn't persist.

**Karen:** I hope that's true because I was a military kid who had a lot of diagnostic X-rays.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin A works with progesterone as another protective thing, but it also happens to sensitize you to the radiation; the radiation breaks down the Vitamin A in your tissue. So if you replace it after the injury, that helps counteract the estrogen-like effects.

**Karen:** What would be a good dose of Vitamin A for an average 50-year-old woman?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's hard to say because, being an unsaturated oily material, it can interfere with thyroid function. The amount you need corresponds exactly to the level of thyroid activity you have. A low thyroid person can get symptoms of Vitamin A poisoning from just a very small amount, like 5,000 units.

When I was in my teens and twenties, I found that I needed 50,000 to 100,000 units to prevent having acne or even leukoplakia. Following dental X-rays, I would get these white spongy growths inside my cheeks that the dentist said were either cancerous or pre-cancerous. I found that these big doses of Vitamin A would clear it up completely in a week. That is a pre-cancerous, estrogen-stimulated condition that also appears on the cervix of the uterus. Vitamin A and progesterone similarly will reverse that.

**Karen:** Were you taking thyroid at the time also?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I just happened to be a hyperthyroid person during that period.

## Thyroid Function: T3 vs. T4

**Karen:** You've mentioned that hyper and hypo are actually kind of the same thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Doctors confuse hypothyroidism with hyper for various historical reasons. The basic thing that thyroid does is increase your oxidative metabolism. When the Synthroid product came on the market—which is only thyroxine (T4) rather than the complete compilation of T3 and T4—they wanted to say that thyroxine was the real thyroid hormone. It happens that it doesn't stimulate oxidative metabolism until it's turned into T3.

For about 20 years, there was the doctrine that thyroid doesn't stimulate oxidative metabolism as its basic mechanism. But in fact, thyroxine interferes with oxygen metabolism if it's out of balance. It's really the increased consumption of oxygen and production of defensive energy systems that makes thyroid valuable. For example, oxidative energy is used to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and male hormones to counteract estrogen. If you have excess cholesterol, it's usually because your thyroid is deficient or your Vitamin A is deficient, and you aren't converting it to the protective hormones.

## Organic Food and Carrageenan

**Host:** We have Dr. Lita Lee on our show often, and she coined the expression "Pro-Thyroid Diet." She said you should eat organic. Do you agree with that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lately, everyone has been calling their stuff organic. I was getting a kind of organic whipping cream for my coffee, and I saw they were putting carrageenan in it. When they can say that carrageenan is an organic food just because you get it out of the ocean... well, the ocean isn't such a clean food source anymore. Carrageenan is highly allergenic. People have died by contact with it, and many people have serious allergic reactions when they eat it. When it breaks down, it becomes carcinogenic, but it's still allowed in the food supply and can be called organic. Some of the nuclear industry were even applying to the government to be able to call nuclear waste-fertilized food organic.

**Host:** I work as an organic farm inspector. I remember when the USDA was coming up with the standards, they were going to allow human sewage sludge, irradiated food, and GMO food to be labeled organic. People like Karen and I petitioned the USDA, and they listened. But I know it's a complicated world.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Carrageenan is the main problem with some of the foods called organic, but naturally, it's best if you can get really clean organic food.

## Pregnenolone

**Karen:** Dr. Peat, you mentioned pregnenolone. That's one of my favorite supplements since you introduced us to it. Could you elaborate on the benefits and some of the scare tactics put on labels saying it causes cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That stuff just seems to come out of thin air. In the 40s, when drug companies wanted to get natural progesterone off the market, they said you can't take it orally because it's destroyed by stomach acid. There was absolutely no source for that; it was just inserted into an article and multiplied until all the doctors believed it.

California, for reasons I explained in an article on my website about conflicts of interest, decided to call progesterone a cause of cancer, even though the articles they cited actually showed it prevents cancer. The fact that California got progesterone on their list of cancer agents seems to have simply spread over to pregnenolone without any argument at all.

**Karen:** Why do these companies acquiesce and put that warning on their label?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Because California gave lawyers a law that lets them collect money for suing anyone they want to. There have been articles calling it the "shakedown state."

**Karen:** What is your take on pregnenolone? What benefit will that have for people with dementia?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If the pregnenolone is well made and pure—and in recent years, everything on the market does seem to be pure if the retailer isn't adding crazy excipients—it has essentially no side effects at any dose. Since the 1940s, experiments in rats showed that a 10-gram single dose by stomach tube (like a person eating a pound of it) only made the rats not hungry until their stomachs emptied. If any of the rats were under stress at the time, their stress hormones went down to normal. That was the only side effect: it stopped abnormal stress reactions.

**Karen:** So we could presume that would happen in people too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. After I read the rat experiment and saw that it made people more efficient in studies of workers, I decided to take 3,000mg to 4,000mg every day for a year. I felt like I had great resistance and felt no stress, no matter what was happening.

**Karen:** Were there any negative side effects at all?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not at all.

**Karen:** Do you take that much to this day?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it was too expensive. I haven't taken any for years now. I stopped because for a while a lot of junk was on the market, and when I tried to import the pure stuff, the FDA kept getting in the way.

## Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFA)

**Host:** Dr. Peat, I know you lecture around the United States and Mexico. What kind of reactions do you get? You say a lot of things that nobody else is saying.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I pretty much stopped lecturing about 20 years ago. When the word got out what I was saying about unsaturated fat, the doctors stopped wanting to hear me. When they knew what I would say about estrogen, and then the health food industry stopped wanting to hear me when they knew what I would say about corn oil, soy oil, fish oil, and so on. Those are so important to their business that they didn't want bad information put out about them.

**Karen:** What is it that you say about that that would be problematic for them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see the polyunsaturated n-3 and n-6 oils as being behind all the inflammatory degenerative diseases. Basically, all degenerative diseases involve an inflammatory component which is amplified by the n-3 and n-6 breakdown products.

**Karen:** You think the cumulative value of those oils in the human body, as they get packed away in the tissue, has a metabolic suppressive action?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the prostaglandins, various isoprostanes, free radical breakdown products, and so on. Those fats happen to inhibit the enzymes which make our natural n-9 polyunsaturated fats, such as the Mead acid. It's called an "essential fatty acid deficiency" when you can find the Mead acid (n-9) in the blood. But it happens that that is a protective, anti-inflammatory fat that gives great resistance to the animals that are so-called "deficient" in the essential fatty acids.

**Karen:** So it would be beneficial to us to avoid those polyunsaturated oils such as corn, canola, safflower, sunflower, and almond?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I try to avoid that as far as possible. Even avoiding pork and chicken that have been fed those foods.

## Radiation and Light Therapy

**Karen:** Can I ask you again about the Fukushima radiation? We noticed within a week of the radiation that our air purifier started making a pinging noise. Could that have been from hot particles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know how the purifier works, but the particles do produce ionization that could affect electronic devices. The nuclear industry, like the estrogen and oil industries, has been very busy with propaganda since the 1940s, convincing the public that nuclear power will be good. They've been selling radioactive potions since the 1920s. You can get some quick relief from X-raying your knee for arthritis—it kills the cells that produce inflammation—but it creates a long-term systemic inflammation that is much worse.

The propaganda covers the spectrum of every kind of radiation. They say that the fallout in your food is equivalent to flying across the country on an airplane. Every person who repeats that is repeating layered lying propaganda. It's true there is a certain amount of radiation from cosmic rays at 35,000 feet, but the biological effect of cosmic rays at high altitude is much less per unit of radiation than at sea level. At high altitude, they pass right through you. But on the way through the atmosphere, they run into air atoms, causing secondary and tertiary breakdown nuclear fission. It's those fission products produced on the way down close to sea level that increase the environmental radiation. That's a big reason why cancer and heart disease rates are much lower when you live at 5,000 to 10,000 feet elevation. The nuclear industry is turning things upside down to say that eating a banana or a Fukushima oyster can be compared to cosmic rays.

**Karen:** We live on an island and like to go out in the sun. Should we be afraid that our cancer levels are going to increase because we're at sea level?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ultraviolet produces effects in your skin that are very similar to what X-rays and gamma rays produce throughout your tissues. However, the toxic effect of ultraviolet is limited to 2 or 3 millimeters near the top of your skin. It happens that the red light of sunlight—the yellow, green, orange, red frequencies—are neutralizers of the damage done by toxic radiation. Experiments with frogs showed that if you gave them a lethal dose of gamma rays but followed it within the hour with very bright red light, they recovered.

**Karen:** So would it be good to get a red light and lay under it for protection?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, natural sunlight contains enough of that. If you filter out that protective red and orange light, sunlight will even kill plants. It's the red light that allows plants to withstand ultraviolet all day.

**Karen:** Would that be the far infrared light bulbs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, just the red, orange, and yellow are all protective. You don't want too much of the ultraviolet because your blood circulates up through the surface of your skin, and your white blood cells will get killed every time you get sunburned. The melanin pigment catches the biggest part of the ultraviolet and protects your skin from that immune-suppressing effect.

**Karen:** What's wrong with people who don't tan and just burn?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes a Vitamin D deficiency is involved. Your body knows that it needs more Vitamin D, so it doesn't make the pigment, allowing more ultraviolet to be absorbed. I've seen people who couldn't tan suddenly tanning normally when they took some Vitamin D.

## Conclusion

**Host:** Dr. Peat, we only have about one minute left. Karen and I would love to bring you on for next week's show if you have the time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, very good.

**Host:** Terrific. People can go to your website, which is RayPeat.com. I love your artwork, Dr. Peat. I think all of us working in this industry need a hobby or release.

**Karen:** I love your blue book, *From PMS to Menopause*, and *Nutrition for Women*.

**Host:** We're going to talk about that next week because I have a bunch more questions for you. Thank you for being our guest today and sharing your Saturday morning with us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. Very good.
