## Introduction

**Jodelle:** I am pleased to have Dr. Peat on with me again today. For those of you who have not familiarized yourself yet with Dr. Raymond Peat, you can check him out at RayPeat.com. We're going to be talking today about testosterone and high cortisol. I wanted to touch on this because I am seeing a lot of clients coming in with their blood work showing too high of cortisol and too low of testosterone—even women. I think it's a pretty important topic. Dr. Peat, how long have you been learning and teaching on this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Altogether as early as 1960, when I was doing it independently. Then I concentrated on the hormones between 1968 and 1972, when I got my PhD.

**Jodelle:** I know you've taught at numerous schools, including the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and internationally in Mexico. I consider you the leading authority based on everyone I've looked into over the years. I want to talk specifically about this tag team of symptoms: low testosterone and high cortisol. Could you talk about why cortisol is so high in so many people right now and the sex hormones are down?

## The Physiology of Stress and Hormones

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it isn't the sex hormones as a group, because estrogen rises when you're under stress along with cortisol. When the androgens in general decrease, that usually goes with a decrease of progesterone, and that creates a susceptibility to stress. Practically everything harmful will increase both your estrogen and cortisol.

The first barrier to harm is the group of steroids: pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone. All of these have broadly overlapping protective effects that protect your energy apparatus and sensory apparatus, keeping things stable and working. Injury simply doesn't happen when you have a great abundance of those things. You can run a marathon or swim in ice water and do all sorts of things that could kill a more fragile person. If you're really well supplied with pregnenolone and its derivatives down to testosterone, you've got endurance, so you don't experience stress.

When something happens where you're not abundantly producing the protective steroids, then any little thing becomes stressful. Just walking can be a stress. Breathing harder, you will shift over to the lactic acid metabolism. With increasing age or malnutrition—anything that interferes with the production of these protective steroids—you shift over to the emergency production of cortisol.

All of these protective steroids block the effect of cortisol. You can take a cortisol pill or prednisone and have very little harm from it if you're fairly saturated with progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone, because they prevent the action as well as taking care of some of the things that cortisol would produce.

**Jodelle:** What does cortisol do to the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cortisol maintains your blood sugar level so that you can keep working, but it does it by converting your protein. Tissues, muscles, skin, thymus gland, lymphatic tissues in general, and finally the digestive system—liver and intestine—will be cannibalized to make sugar and energy under the influence of cortisol.

The protective effect of testosterone was demonstrated once using radioactive testosterone molecules. They injected it into athletes and thought that they would see radiation coming out of their muscles. But what they saw was most of the radiation was coming from their heart. Testosterone is most concentrated in the organs that are most vital to survival. So it concentrates in the heart, lungs, and brain at the highest ratio to protein. Even though it's responsible for making an athlete's muscles bigger, what it's doing is preventing those from being used up for energy.

With age, if you're producing less of the protective steroids, a given amount of cortisol might not look extremely high in relation to the standards. But if your pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone are lower than average, even a moderate amount of cortisol begins eating up your muscles and skin, and eventually, it can start deteriorating your heart, lungs, and brain.

## Thyroid Function and Cholesterol

**Jodelle:** Is it the chicken or the egg? Is it a high cortisol response that leads to low progesterone and testosterone, or is it something happening that causes the low hormones which leads to the stress response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's usually a gradual deterioration from poor nutrition, eating foods that are irritating or toxic, or foods that suppress your thyroid function. Thyroid is necessary to produce these protective steroids. Cholesterol is converted pretty massively into pregnenolone and the other protective steroids if you have Vitamin A and thyroid hormone adequately. But if you're deficient in either of those, the cholesterol will rise in your blood. That generally means that you're not making enough DHEA and testosterone.

So, low thyroid, which causes high cholesterol, really means you're not making enough of the protective testosterone and related steroids. When that happens, your cortisol and other stress hormones rise. Low thyroid is the most common thing responsible for a bad ratio of cortisol to testosterone.

## Exercise, Overtraining, and Metabolism

**Jodelle:** Could overtraining or over-exercising also lead to this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Someone did an experiment putting people on a treadmill and measuring their active thyroid hormone, T3. They had them walk very mildly, keeping their pulse rate at 120 beats per minute or less. In an hour, they had become hypothyroid in the sense of reducing their activation of thyroid into T3.

Doctors are now being taught that they should ignore T3 (the active hormone) and think about only Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4). But when an athlete depresses their T3, their thyroxine will actually rise in a reaction. Doctors are being taught things that will make them miss the effects of stress on your thyroid.

When your thyroid goes down from stress, your estrogen normally is being excreted and kept at a low level systemically by the thyroid activating liver metabolism. The liver solubilizes estrogen, making it leave through the kidneys. If your thyroid drops from stress, very quickly your estrogen will rise. Then the estrogen acts directly on the adrenals; it increases cortisol production. It activates your pituitary to stimulate cortisol production and activates your brain to release Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH). So just dropping the active thyroid, you very quickly turn on both the estrogen and the whole cortisol stress system.

**Jodelle:** Are you familiar with CrossFit? Imagine these people doing intense overexertion.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Russians, 50 or 60 years ago, were being accused of using testosterone because they had worked out the way to under-train—avoid overexertion—and so keep their stress hormones down and their testosterone up. It takes a very moderate amount of muscle-building exercise to increase testosterone and lower cortisol.

The muscle itself becomes an endocrine organ. If you're under stress, your muscle will actually produce cortisol and not testosterone. When it's properly stimulated, the muscle becomes a testosterone-producing organ. It isn't just the gonads that produce testosterone if you're doing things right.

**Jodelle:** So this chronic output in CrossFit classes or heavy-duty weight training might be harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A woman doing just one or two minutes of mild dumbbell lifts and a few squats for the big leg muscles can shift her balance from cortisol to testosterone.

**Jodelle:** So it is beneficial to lift heavy things, but we don't need to do these hour-long classes that push the body to the limit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## SHBG, Adrenaline, and Thyroid Diagnosis

**Jodelle:** Can you talk a little bit about Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is the body's defense against estrogen. When it's high, a woman has a lower risk of breast cancer because it keeps the estrogen out of cells. But when it's high in response to defending against estrogen, it can also interfere with the testosterone effect.

**Jodelle:** How does adrenaline fit into this mix with cortisol and estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the stress hormones interfere with the conversion of T4 to T3. Instead of making the effective, respiration-promoting T3, they convert thyroxine into Reverse T3. They dispose of the precursor and turn it into an interfering, inactive suppressor of respiration.

Those same stress hormones that produce the inactive Reverse T3 also tend to suppress the pituitary TSH, making it look like you're even hyperthyroid. Doctors are taught to diagnose hyperthyroidism in terms of abnormally low TSH. But in fact, the stress which is lowering most people's TSH is caused by hypothyroidism. So a low thyroid person raises their estrogen, cortisol, and adrenaline, and these add up to lower your TSH and make it look like you have too much thyroid.

**Jodelle:** That explains why so many people go to the doctor and are told they have too much thyroid, yet they exhibit signs of low thyroid like weight gain and hair loss.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. For 65 years it's been known how it works, but doctors are increasingly misinformed. Even if a person isn't hypothyroid in the sense of not having enough T3, if their TSH is increased, they will get the worst heart disease signs of hypothyroidism. TSH itself is an inflammation-promoting hormone.

## Weight Gain and Depression

**Jodelle:** I don't think people understand the importance of women having adequate testosterone. With low testosterone, I see additional weight gain.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has to be balanced in both men and women with DHEA and cortisol. Especially DHEA is an activator of fat oxidizing. Your muscle is the organ that is most equipped for oxidizing fat. Your brain and heart don't do well oxidizing fat compared to glucose, but the muscles are perfectly adapted for it. Everything you do to increase your muscle's production of testosterone and reduction of cortisol is favoring that fat burning. Just the right amount of exercise to build muscle will shift your metabolism to safely consume fat in your muscles while leaving adequate glucose for your brain and lungs.

**Jodelle:** What are other symptoms of high cortisol and low testosterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Depression. The whole stress system that ends up increasing your cortisol and decreasing DHEA, progesterone, and testosterone is related to inflammatory and degenerative processes. Depression is how we experience that process. The body senses that it's being destroyed by the stress hormones and it wants to stop everything to sort of hibernate until the stress is over. Sometimes you see anxiety and aggression. Aggression comes up when you're being overstressed. But when your body is being damaged, you get these negative emotions: aggression, anxiety, and depression.

## Fasting and Intermittent Fasting

**Jodelle:** You hear a lot about fasting and intermittent fasting as a way to improve hormones. Do you see fasting as a way to lower cortisol, or is it contributing to the stress response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In one day of fasting, the body stores several ounces of glucose in the form of glycogen. If you're healthy, you can go up to 24 hours before you are short on glycogen. As the body senses stress, lowering the T3 slows the rate of fuel use. When your glycogen is gone, you have to start using your tissue to make glucose out of your muscles. If your thyroid didn't slow down during this prolonged stress, you would eat your whole body up in just a few days. But since the depressive process turns off metabolism, it slows the rate of degeneration.

If you give a little bit of glucose and minerals—sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium—during the low-calorie period, you can greatly reduce your tissue loss. On a complete water fast for 10 days, they found that 80% or more of the weight loss came from the destruction of muscle and skin. But if they had a 500 or 600 calorie diet with adequate minerals, almost all of the weight loss was in the form of fat loss. So a complete fast is very destructive to the body.

**Jodelle:** Fasting in nature would mean we didn't find food, so it would be a stress response.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Some professors advocated fasting for detoxification, but that got me interested in what really happens. The liver is the organ of detoxification. When you deprive the liver of sugar and expose it to cortisol, not only does estrogen rise, but the liver loses its ability to detoxify other things. Estrogen rises because the sulfation and glucuronidation detoxifying systems are shut down by fasting.

In Mexico, I was exposed to a type of insecticide used on buses. When I realized I was being poisoned, I left. Driving home, every time I got hungry, I would smell this insecticide in my exhaled breath. For about two months, every time I had low blood sugar at 3:00 AM, I would wake up smelling this Pine-Sol insecticide odor. As soon as that odor stopped leaving my body when I got hungry, I went into a hyperthyroid state. It had been suppressing my thyroid.

When you're starving, you're living on your body tissues, including fat, and that can mobilize toxins that had been stored away. A fast is a way to maybe clean up your liver eventually, but definitely, it's not good for your brain and immune system.

## Liver Function and Hormone Supplementation

**Jodelle:** The liver is also important for testosterone production, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the case of progesterone, a woman produces maybe 30 milligrams a day during the premenstrual time. The liver adapts to that very large production. After two weeks, the enzymes increase and start excreting progesterone as well as estrogen and testosterone. At menstruation, the synthesis of new progesterone stops. For two weeks, the liver has very low exposure, meaning it has a chance to reset its detoxifying enzymes to zero.

If a man is supplementing testosterone every day and exceeds the liver's normal preference, the liver experiences the same thing a woman's liver experiences with high progesterone. After a week or two of high testosterone exposure, he is now excreting it very fast and probably getting about as much estrogen effect as testosterone effect. In medical use, they sometimes give 50 or 100 milligrams at once. The liver goes into a testosterone-destroying condition.

## Cancer, Stress, and Serotonin

**Jodelle:** My mom died of stomach cancer at 45. She lived a very stressful existence—over-exercising, hardly sleeping, starving herself. How does chronically elevated cortisol relate to cancer?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Behind the rise of estrogen and cortisol and the fall of thyroid is the tissue level of stress. In the alimentary canal, histamine and serotonin are massively produced. 95% of our serotonin comes from the intestine. Stomach ulcers can be produced just by an excess of serotonin.

As histamine and serotonin increase in the digestive system, that allows endotoxin and nitric oxide to rise. All of those interfere with our ability to produce respiratory energy. You shift over to lactic acid production. Lactic acid activates the stress hormones, promotes inflammation, and is carcinogenic in itself.

Serotonin is one of the most powerful activators of the cortisol stress hormone system. It acts powerfully on the hypothalamus to make CRH. Stomach cancer and intestinal cancer are very deeply involved with excess serotonin.

## Sleep and Brain Health

**Jodelle:** Are there certain habits, like being an overachiever or over-analyzer, that create this stress response?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regular sleep is a powerfully protective thing. It should be somewhere in the range of six to nine hours every night, but the *regularity* is very important. It becomes a built-in, almost machine-like regulator. Any variation of that schedule puts the whole 24-hour cycle into a stress pattern.

High progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA are promoters of restorative sleep. Cortisol interferes at all levels of sleep restoration.

Regarding habits like starvation or anorexia nervosa: they have done MRI pictures of brains during anorexia and during recovery. During anorexia, the brain—especially the frontal lobes—shrinks. When they repeat it during recovery, it rebuilds itself. So it's actually causing brain damage to fast too much. A stressful pregnancy with too much exposure to estrogen and cortisol does the same thing. Androgens protect the brain, heart, and lungs, but prolonged exposure to high estrogen will shrink the frontal lobes that handle long-range perspective.

**Jodelle:** I like that you said it can be rebuilt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's very much like exercise, but you have to stop the stress first. Taxi drivers have a bigger part of the brain that handles memory because they know every street in a big city. That kind of exercise works best if you maintain the protective hormones—even supplementing pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone—combined with the kind of mental activity that you want to develop. That will, in a relatively short time, rebuild.

## Diet: Sugar, Carbs, and Stress Reduction

**Jodelle:** Can you expand on "learned helplessness"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That can be repaired with protective hormones or behavioral insight, but stopping the stress is the first thing. That requires good nutrition. Good nutrition should include plenty of carbohydrate so that you don't have to rely on cortisol to convert protein into glucose. Usually, something more than 100 grams per day of carbohydrate—preferably in the form of sucrose—is needed. If you're very active physically, 200 or 300 grams a day of carbohydrate, especially sugar, can be restorative to the brain.

**Jodelle:** I wanted to talk about the dangers of a sugarless diet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** All of the things that trigger the stress hormones involve interference with glucose metabolism. Hypoglycemia itself is a powerful activator of the stress system. Excess of free fatty acids, which block the ability to use glucose, will activate the stress hormones. Lactic acid results when you're not using your glucose properly; it's a sign of a deficiency of glucose that activates cortisol production.

The obvious way to stop the stress reaction is to provide enough glucose and oxygen along with the other nutrients. If you provide only protein and fat, you're going to increase your cortisol just to convert the protein to the amount of glucose that your brain and blood cells need.

**Jodelle:** Are there specific foods that help lower cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason I talk so much about milk and orange juice is that they are the most available foods that have the most components that tend to shut down excess cortisol production, lower adrenaline, and reduce serotonin and nitric oxide.

Everyone can usually find good milk and sweet orange juice. The calcium in milk and the minerals—potassium and others—in orange juice lower the stress factors. Most people have a borderline calcium and Vitamin D deficiency. When you are borderline, you increase your parathyroid hormone. If you're borderline in sodium, your aldosterone increases. Parathyroid hormone and aldosterone interact to turn off your energy production, shift you over to wasting sugar, increasing cortisol, and destroying your tissues. Getting your aldosterone and parathyroid hormone as low as you can will increase your metabolic efficiency.

## Fats and Proteins

**Jodelle:** What about fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avoiding the polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) is a universal benefit. Do not add fish oil, algae oil, safflower, or canola oil to your diet. Those are all anti-thyroid, anti-progesterone, and anti-DHEA. They increase your stress hormones. Just cutting out the polyunsaturated fats shifts you to increased thyroid function.

**Jodelle:** That leaves us with saturated fats.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at the ratio of saturated fat to polyunsaturated in your tissues, the saturation index corresponds to lifespan. Animals with the highest saturation index have the longest life expectancy.

In the 1930s, a man did a lab experiment intended to demonstrate that taking out all of the fat would cause a deficiency of essential fatty acids. But this guy had lifelong headaches and blood pressure problems. After three or four months on this fat-free diet, he stopped having headaches and his blood pressure normalized. He never had a recurrence of his health problems. Far from producing deficiency diseases, this extreme fat-free diet cured his lifelong health problems.

**Jodelle:** What are your favorite sources of protein for lowering cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Gelatin happens to be fairly close to an ideal protein for an adult. Milk protein has a fair amount of tryptophan and cysteine. These are pro-inflammatory amino acids that are used in growth. Milk is ideal for growing, but for an adult, I think it should be supplemented with something like gelatin, which lacks the pro-inflammatory growth-related amino acids.

**Jodelle:** So you could blend your morning coffee with collagen/gelatin and milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I use about 8 or 9 ounces of milk with an ounce or two of extremely concentrated coffee for my breakfast meal.
