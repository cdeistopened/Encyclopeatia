## Introduction

**Jodelle:** Welcome to the Get Fit with Jodelle show. I am so excited to have Dr. Raymond Peat with me today. He has a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana, the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, and Blake College.

He started his research in 1968—long before many of us so-called nutrition nerds were born—mainly regarding progesterone and the hormones closely related to it as protectors of the body's structure and energy against the harmful effects of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen. He is also the editor and writer of his famous newsletter, an author, and an artist. Dr. Peat, I am so excited to speak with you today. How are you doing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good, thank you.

**Jodelle:** Will you please tell my listeners briefly what got you into this passion for all things related to stress, hormones, and the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1950s and 60s, I was interested in psychology and language. I started a school in Mexico, Blake College. In the process, I noticed that many local people were eating a very bad diet. A couple of my friends had family members who were very sick. Having read Adelle Davis's books, I suggested some of her nutritional therapies.

For example, a friend's nephew had been in the hospital for two or three days with diarrhea that they couldn't control. They said he wouldn't live through the night. My friend decided there was no harm in trying the vitamin B6 supplement, which was one of Adelle Davis's recommendations for diarrhea. He gave the child a 10-milligram tablet of vitamin B6, and within the hour, the diarrhea stopped. He recovered in just a couple of days. A single vitamin did what the whole hospital staff couldn't manage with intravenous treatments.

I realized that a lot of information wasn't getting into the medical system. I decided to study biology instead of the humanities. In graduate school, I ran into the same dogmatism. I had planned to study brain biology, but I saw that the professors were locked into a dogmatic view of how a nerve works. I found that the reproductive physiology department at the University of Oregon was actually doing open research, trying to discover the causes of infertility in aging.

## Hormones: Estrogen vs. Progesterone

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I shifted from brain biology to reproductive physiology. In examining the factors that make it possible for a fertilized ovum to develop into a whole organism, I found that the brain is governed and formed by the same factors that govern fertility. The same things that cause infertility cause bad development of the brain.

I realized that the drug industry had been propagandizing the public with the idea that estrogen is the "female hormone." In our lab, we saw that estrogen was the contraceptive hormone, not the hormone of fertility. The pharmaceutical industry knew that estrogen made a good contraception pill—it was actually causing abortions—but they called it the anti-conception pill.

The real hormone of fertility and brain development turns out to be progesterone. It works by providing energy to the developing embryo in the form of oxygen and glucose. Estrogen is a factor that interrupts that process. Estrogen creates a local inflammation in the uterus—a kind of wound that allows the ovum to embed—but if the estrogen stays dominant, it kills the ovum. The function of progesterone is to knock the estrogen out of the tissue and shift that inflammatory physiology into a supportive, oxidative, sugar-rich environment.

**Jodelle:** That is not at all what we've been taught. I was always taught the importance of estrogen. A lot of your work is done around these hormones, but you also talk about stress. Would you say that stress is the driving factor behind most disease and that it contributes to the rise in estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would say stress is the factor in all disease. If you define it as a mismatch between the organism and the environment, then even so-called genetic diseases are diseases of stress. For example, sickle cell anemia is a defensive mutation against malaria in Africa. If people eat a diet that maintains an oxidative condition, there is no sickle cell disease. But when you don't have that environment, it shows up as a disease.

Inflammation is the basic factor in why stress causes disease. Heart disease and obesity, for example, are seen to originate with stress physiology. Stress leads to inflammation, and that leads to specific diseases.

## Defining Stress and Environmental Factors

**Jodelle:** When you say stress, you aren't just talking about day-to-day living. You're talking about environmental stressors like radiation, pollutants, and emotional stress, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. It is when the environment puts demands on you that you don't have the internal resources to meet smoothly. An 18-year-old who is well-fed can meet changes in weather or physical exertion without stress. That same activity might kill someone who wasn't well-nourished or was elderly. It is a matter of what resources you have internally in proportion to the stress.

**Jodelle:** Can you help us understand the stressors of our modernized society?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The drug industry and other technological industries have tried to cover up the fact that they are causing disease. There has been a propaganda movement to convince the public that pollution is not harmful. Fifty years ago, the government had a campaign to tell people that radiation was good for you—the idea of "radiation hormesis," that a little poison is good for you. That is a perversion of the idea of stress.

A teenager meeting a challenge—like a tennis game or building something—builds the body and skills. That is not stress. Stress is a demand put on you that you didn't ask for and don't have the ability to do easily and with pleasure. Doing a boring, stupid job that you don't love is poisoning your tissues constantly because you aren't getting pleasure out of the activity.

**Jodelle:** I read in Hans Selye's book *Stress Without Distress* that many people live lives trying to appease others or doing jobs they don't like, and they usually die of disease because of that chronic existence.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 1960s, Marian Diamond found that rats in an enriched environment—with toys and things to explore—had brains that functioned better. Their enzymes changed, and their babies had bigger brains. More recently, it was found that the enriched-environment rats produced more progesterone and had lower levels of estrogen. Conversely, if you gave pregnant animals estrogen, the babies' brains were shrunken because it stopped growth by causing stress.

## Thyroid Function and Toxic Exposure

**Jodelle:** I found you when I went through a bad toxic mold exposure. My thyroid was hugely affected. How does the thyroid get affected by chronic stress or acute stressors like toxic mold?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The oxidative sugar metabolism controlled by estrogen and progesterone requires thyroid hormone to work. You don't have oxygen metabolism without thyroid.

Someone cultured a slice of thyroid gland and added hormones to it. If they added progesterone, the thyroid gland secreted active thyroid hormone. When they added estrogen, it blocked those enzymes and stopped secretion, but allowed the cells to synthesize thyroglobulin (colloid). This explains why women often have a swollen thyroid gland around menopause or puberty when estrogen risks becoming dominant. The pituitary drives the gland to produce hormone, but because of the estrogen, it just swells up. Many women have had their thyroid destroyed when all they needed was to lower estrogen or take a progesterone supplement.

**Jodelle:** My thyroid damage led to cellulite appearing in three months, even though I exercised and ate the same. What was the mechanism behind that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When your thyroid isn't adequate, your cells act as if they are under the influence of estrogen. Estrogen's metabolic effects can't be distinguished from the effects of radiation, suffocation, or poisoning with cyanide. They all poison your oxidative system.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are the source of age pigment. Estrogen, radiation, and oxygen deprivation all accelerate the formation of age pigment, causing PUFAs to spontaneously oxidize. Poisons, such as your mold poisoning, end up acting like estrogen in that they poison your ability to use oxygen.

**Jodelle:** I didn't think about mold acting like an estrogen. Are there other things acting like estrogens in our body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, soot was found to be highly estrogenic. That explains why smoke is a carcinogen. Any irritant that stimulates the cell so intensely that the oxidative system can't keep up acts as an estrogen.

Nanoparticles are a major issue. These occur in smoke, traffic exhaust, and tire dust, but industry also uses them as additives—titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide—to thicken shampoo, toothpaste, and food. When absorbed, these insoluble particles act as a constant irritant to the cell. That disproportion between irritation and energy supply has an estrogenic and carcinogenic action.

**Jodelle:** Would those be in supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you look at the ingredients of vitamins and drugs, you very often see titanium dioxide or silica. Even if they claim to use larger granular material, they often contain the toxic nanoparticles.

## Diet: PUFAs and Fish Oil

**Jodelle:** Are there diets that are estrogenic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) are made more active by estrogen, but they also intensify estrogen activity. Both Omega-6 and Omega-3 PUFAs promote the effects of estrogen.

**Jodelle:** What are the most offending PUFAs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Around 1950, the food industry had surplus cottonseed oil that was no longer needed for paint. They turned seed oils into a basic food material, calling them "heart protective." However, studies found that cancer and heart disease increased with this diet.

People then turned toward Omega-3s (fish oil). The only advantage Omega-3s have over Omega-6s is that they are extremely unstable and block the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. You get an anti-inflammatory effect initially because it poisons the enzymes that make prostaglandins. However, the oxidative instability of Omega-3s leads to toxic breakdown products like acrolein. Acrolein poisons sperm cells and oocytes, increasing the risk of birth defects.

Despite evidence showing toxic effects on the developing brain, they still add fish oil to baby formula. As a person ages, PUFAs accumulate in the brain. In proportion to the amount of PUFA in the brain, the metabolic rate slows down. This corresponds to the decline of cognitive ability and oxidative metabolism.

**Jodelle:** If people realized that breast milk is 50-60% saturated fat, they would see that PUFAs don't have a place for us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. And the amount of PUFA in a mother's blood corresponds to the amount of estrogen. If she has too much estrogen, she won't produce enough milk.

## Fasting, Sugar, and Metabolism

**Jodelle:** What about intermittent fasting? Is that a beneficial stressor?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Blood sugar normally falls during the hours of darkness. This is compensated by a rise in free fatty acids in the bloodstream. That is the same pattern that happens when you are under stress. When glycogen is depleted, you mobilize free fatty acids to oxidize for energy. This requires more oxygen and is inefficient.

When you aren't getting enough oxygen, your body starts turning protein into glucose. Lactic acid rises, which is a sign of stress. Every night, as you mobilize free fatty acids, you go into this stress state, causing damage to mitochondria. Bone loss in women happens primarily at night; the calcium shows up in the morning urine. This degeneration happens because we run out of glycogen. The longer you go without eating, the more you rely on inefficient fat oxidation.

**Jodelle:** You are not a fan of fat burning for energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you look at blood tests, women have about 80 times greater growth hormone than men. This is an effect of estrogen causing chronically high mobilization of free fatty acids. The high growth hormone is a compensation. To the extent you can minimize that, you reduce the chronic degenerative process.

**Jodelle:** So you advocate for consuming carbohydrates to build glycogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. At the end of the 19th century, doctors cured patients wasting away from diabetes by feeding them as much sugar as they desired—about 12 ounces a day. Free fatty acids kill the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Glucose supports the regeneration of insulin-producing cells. Those doctors found that normal sugar-regulating functions came back when they interrupted the destructive process of fat oxidation.

**Jodelle:** The mainstream is pushing Keto and low carb, but people are coming to me exhausted.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The brain and muscles must store glycogen to work. If you are forced to make glucose, you do it at the expense of your body—turning muscle tissue into glucose. This degrades your functional tissues.

**Jodelle:** When I did carnivore, I felt better initially, but then my sleep suffered. When I added carbs back, my sleep dialed in.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Regarding meat-eating: The parathyroid gland is activated by phosphate. Meat, beans, and grains have an extremely high concentration of phosphate relative to calcium. Milk and green vegetables have a favorable high calcium-to-phosphate ratio, which suppresses the parathyroid hormone.

When parathyroid hormone is high, it mobilizes calcium out of your bones and puts it into soft tissues—arteries, brain, etc. This calcification is a sign of aging. High parathyroid hormone also activates the rancidity of PUFAs. Many fad diets emphasize meat and nuts (high phosphate) rather than green vegetables, fruits, and milk (high calcium).

## Recommendations and Conclusion

**Jodelle:** What can we do to start mitigating this stress?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:**
1.  **Frequent snacks:** Don't let yourself go too long without eating. Have fruit, milk, or cheese at hand.
2.  **Sunlight:** The red and orange waves reduce free radicals produced by PUFA. Ultraviolet makes vitamin D, which helps handle sugar and calcium.
3.  **Diet:** Completely eliminate liquid vegetable oils (canola, soy, cottonseed) and reduce seeds, nuts, and fatty fish. Oysters and shellfish are safer.

**Jodelle:** And lifestyle strategies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The most important thing is to figure out what is important in your life and work toward that. Consider the necessities—like a horrible job—as only a stepping stone to doing something more sane and productive. If you have a long-range perspective that is meaningful, it makes the immediate stress disappear.
