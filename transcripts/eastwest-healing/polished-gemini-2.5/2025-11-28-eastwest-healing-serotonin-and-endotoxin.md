# Serotonin and Endotoxin

**Josh Rubin:** What up everyone? This is Josh Rubin and Jeannie Rubin of Holistic Living. We're here today to share our radio show with Dr. Raymond Peat. Today's show is on serotonin and endotoxin distress. And of course, like I've always said, Ray Peat is going to school us on these topics.

Before we get started, we just want to give you a little update on what we've been up to. We do our radio show every month. I can't really tell you when our next radio show is because every month we set up a date that works for Ray. But definitely stay tuned to our Facebook page, Josh Rubin or Jeannie Rubin. You can stay tuned to our YouTube or email us directly at info@eastwesthealing.com to find out when the next radio show is.

As I always say, I know a lot of people are contacting Ray. Ray is a very humble guy, very quiet guy, based on my perception. He doesn't really ask for a lot. Just keep in mind that he's been doing this a long time. He likes to answer questions via email, not phone. And he really, from my experience, never says no, nor does he ever ask for money. So please, if you could look up his address on his website, RayPeat.com, and if you're emailing him all the time and he's answering your questions, please send him something—a check, whether it's $5, $10, $100, whatever you can—to compensate him for his time. That's all we really ask. If it wasn't for his research, you wouldn't have this information.

Let's get Jeannie and Ray on the line. I've introduced him many times: who he is, what he does. If you want to learn more about him, go to his website, RayPeat.com. He's got tons of articles, books, and a newsletter. His articles are very in-depth and free. Also check out his books and some of the other people he's referenced in the past, like Broda Barnes, Mary Shomon, Dr. Shanklin, and Dr. Tom Brewer.

He's a teacher, educator, researcher, and today he is going to school us on serotonin and endotoxin. Let me get him on. Hello, you guys there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good.

**Jeannie Rubin:** I'm doing great, Josh. Thanks.

**Josh Rubin:** Before we start, Ray, did you want to say anything, announce anything, or add anything to your intro before we start talking about serotonin and endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not really. I've just been finishing another newsletter that includes stuff on serotonin. This one's on osteoporosis, and serotonin turns out to be a major factor in causing that and other aging degenerative changes.

**Josh Rubin:** Maybe we can talk a little bit about that today without giving all the information away. Are you still taking signups for your newsletter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, sure. Yep.

**Josh Rubin:** Okay. So people can go to your website at RayPeat.com and sign up for that newsletter, guys. It's super inexpensive and a wealth of information.

## Understanding Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** Today I've gotten a lot of requests to talk about serotonin. A lot of people don't know what endotoxin is. You talk about it a lot, and you correlate it with serotonin in the gut. But a lot of people don't understand serotonin. Is it a hormone? Where does it come from? Is it internal, external? I thought it'd be great to do a show so you can educate us on all these different factors as well as supplementation.

You have specific focuses on your research. Why so much focus on serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can't understand the other things that I'm working on unless you know where serotonin fits in. For example, estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen does a lot of its work by way of serotonin. To understand unsaturated fatty acids versus saturated, you have to understand estrogen and serotonin. And to understand thyroid, you have to understand all of those.

It's one of the emergency defense systems, so anything involving stress or compensating for stress, you can't begin to understand without seeing where serotonin fits in. Hans Selye was one of the early researchers on the biological effects of serotonin. That was one of the first places I started running across it. Aldous Huxley was another person that got me interested in its variety of effects.

**Josh Rubin:** When we talk about serotonin, most of the Western research refers to it as a brain chemical. Where do you find most of the serotonin in the body, where is it produced, and what are its main functions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Roughly 95% of it is produced in the intestine. The biggest concentration in the digestive system is in or around the appendix.

Part of how I got interested in the whole pattern of thyroid, estrogen, and serotonin was that when I was about nine years old, I started becoming nearsighted. I occasionally had migraine headaches, and I noticed that things that I ate would tend to bring on the headaches. There were a couple of girls in my school class who were also nearsighted, and I learned that one of them had migraine headaches. I started looking at nearsighted people. Over the next few years, I saw that nearsightedness was much more common among girls, especially starting around puberty. Several of the nearsighted girls that I knew had migraines.

I started thinking about what I had in common with girls in puberty, and it was the thyroid question. Estrogen and serotonin happen to be antithyroid factors. If you're on the borderline for thyroid function, then you're very susceptible to excesses and imbalances in estrogen and serotonin.

The research was just barely starting. I got interested in the symptoms before the substance was identified. Ergot, a fungal disease of grains, was used for probably thousands of years to induce abortions. In the 19th century, attempts were made to use it to accelerate labor, but it was fairly dangerous and would sometimes kill both of them. It causes spasms not only in the uterus but in blood vessels. When people were poisoned by this ergot fungus, they would develop gangrene and insanity, nausea, vomiting—just about every unpleasant symptom you could think of.

In the early 1900s, people were starting to study the chemistry of the ergot fungus. Histamine was the first thing they identified that caused muscular spasms and would accelerate miscarriage, abortion, or normal delivery. For about 20 years, histamine was of considerable interest and led to the development of antihistamines. But in the 1920s and 30s, continuing study of ergot turned up a dozen different categories of amines that would cause muscle spasms the same way histamine does.

Studying ergot was what Hoffman at Sandoz was working on when he accidentally discovered the nervous properties of LSD. That led to a whole further development of chemicals for treating problems with the uterus, circulatory problems, and hormonal problems. But at first, the connection with bodily functions wasn't understood.

An Italian in the 30s had identified an amine in the intestine that caused intestinal contractions. About 10 years later, some English researchers studying huge amounts of beef blood found another amine they thought caused blood vessel contraction. Then the Italian showed that that was the same thing he had found much more abundantly in the intestine—thousands of times more concentrated.

The English group wanted to learn how to assay it because they were thinking about it as the cause of hypertension, strokes, blood clotting, and so on. They gave it to someone to try to identify a sensitive assay to measure the amount in a person rather than having to extract it from tons of cow blood. The person they gave it to happened to have experienced Sandoz's LSD and knew about its mental effects. He was working on the assay finding that the serotonin extracted from the blood would cause uterine contractions, blood vessel contractions—all smooth muscles.

Since he knew the chemistry was an amine parallel to some of the things in ergot, he wondered if the effect of LSD was by having the same antagonistic effects that he saw the LSD had on the serotonin. Serotonin would block the contraction of the uterus. LSD would block the serotonin-induced contraction of the uterus, or of the blood vessel, or of the intestine. Serotonin would block the kidney function so no urine was produced; LSD would restore kidney function.

Since he saw straight-across antagonism between LSD and serotonin, he proposed that the brain contains a small amount of serotonin and that LSD is having its effects by antagonizing this small amount of serotonin in the brain.

**Josh Rubin:** So we should all take a little dose of LSD every day to be anti-inflammatory and downregulate serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a new interest in LSD as a protective chemical. They're finding that it prevents nerve damage caused by some of the serotonergic excitotoxic chemicals. They're even proposing it as an antipsychotic treatment given in the right doses.

The disease called carcinoid was just being understood at the same time in the 1950s. This turned out to be the result of a tumor in the intestine, especially in the appendix, producing huge amounts of serotonin. Normally, the lungs destroy the serotonin as it's picked up in the bloodstream en route to the lungs. That means that the blood rich in serotonin passes through the right side of the heart before it's detoxified. These people were found to have disease of the valves in the right side of the heart, and they would develop pulmonary artery hypertension. Several of the problems associated with the carcinoid disease included psychosis, a belligerent aggressive attitude, diarrhea, nausea, clotting, fibrosis, and overdevelopment of collagen systems. That was well established as the effect of overproduction of serotonin.

So everyone at that time was thinking about the great possibilities of antagonists to serotonin. By 1960, people were already proposing LSD to cure or prevent migraine headaches and a variety of other things associated with excess serotonin.

But then strange things happened all through medical research. The government came out banning research on LSD. Someone developed the idea that since LSD was an antagonist of serotonin, and the reason for banning LSD was supposedly it made people insane, therefore—the great publicity was—that if LSD by antagonizing serotonin makes you insane, then serotonin must make you sane. That really just spread like a plague through the national culture. That seems to be about the extent of the reasoning behind all of this stuff that you now find everywhere in the internet, television, and newspapers: that serotonin is the happy drug.

## Serotonin Production and Gut Health

**Josh Rubin:** Why is most found in the appendix? Isn't there a lot of it in the small intestine as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there's a gradient, though, increasing as you go down the small intestine. Normally the upper part starting at your stomach is sterile in almost everyone. As you go down, the likelihood of having bacteria increases.

As a person's thyroid function decreases, their intestinal secretions are reduced, and peristalsis is reduced. Bacteria tend to creep farther and farther up. A really healthy person has an almost sterile whole small intestine. The sicker you are, the lower your thyroid function, the more bacteria live in your small intestine. That means that the foods that are slower to digest are going to feed bacteria and encourage them to live more abundantly higher up in your intestine.

Ordinarily, the gradient of bacteria is very concentrated towards the appendix, the lower end of the small intestine. It happens that the gradient of bacterial infection increases parallel to the gradient of serotonin. It's probable that the toxins from the bacteria interacting with the physiology of the person are stimulating the production of serotonin, because the function of serotonin is to cause contraction of the intestinal muscles, get rid of what is in there, cause diarrhea, and get rid of the irritant. If you keep feeding the bacteria and coaxing them to live farther up your intestine, you can produce serotonin more abundantly and farther up your intestine.

**Josh Rubin:** The things that encourage bacterial growth are the ones that are slowest to be broken down by your own enzymes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since we don't have enzymes for fibers such as pectin or for the lignans and various complex fibers, the bacteria live on those. The things that we can digest very quickly—sugars, proteins, and fats—are pretty quickly absorbed. These get absorbed high up in the small intestine, and the bacteria don't get a chance at it because we're absorbing it faster than they can grow.

**Josh Rubin:** For the listeners, can you just identify some of those foods? You're talking about the pectins and lignans that are not digestible or harder to digest?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of vegetables. The less cooked a vegetable is, the better food it is for bacteria. Even the firm fruits, the ones that have a lot of fibrous material such as pectin—crisp apples, crisp pears—are very good bacterial food and very poor human food.

**Josh Rubin:** Pineapple too.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Cellulose itself—the more pure the cellulose is, the less bacteria are able to break it down. Then there are the cellulose fibers that are combined with antiseptic chemicals like the root vegetables. Carrots have defenses that kill mold and things that would rot the carrot plant. So raw carrots have their germicidal defense that helps to kill off the bacterial population where it shouldn't be.

**Josh Rubin:** You talked about how where it's produced and what it does—helps with peristalsis, the protective mechanism. But could something as simple as having a blood sugar handling issue, maybe having the wrong ratios of foods, stimulate serotonin? Or does it go the other way around?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When you're having an acute blood sugar decrease, you put out a lot of adrenaline and sympathetic nerve activity. That cuts the circulation for the fight or flight reaction. You stop your digestive processes and don't deliver very much blood to the intestine. So your intestine is anemic during these emotional stress periods from adrenaline. That can give the bacteria a head start because you stop digesting and the food sits there letting the bacteria have a chance at it. Then any kind of irritation will trigger the serotonin release. Just a fairly mild irritation.

**Josh Rubin:** And then from there, based off a lot of your work, serotonin itself will stimulate cortisol and just keep perpetuating that issue as it synthesizes with estrogen. And as you keep breaking down muscle tissue, it will restore L-tryptophan. So the process can continually be exacerbated.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Even though the gradient normally is for the most serotonin to be down where the most bacteria live, when you're under severe stress—experimentally, they just strap a rat down so it can't move for a few hours—that causes serotonin production in the stomach. That causes bleeding very quickly.

## Estrogen, PUFA, and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** What other hormones does serotonin synthesize with? You talked about histamine. What is its correlation with estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen activates the enzyme that turns tryptophan to serotonin. The rate-limiting tryptophan hydroxylase is activated by estrogen and inhibited by progesterone. That's the route *into* the serotonin.

The route *out* of serotonin—for example, the monoamine oxidase type A—happens to be inhibited by estrogen, so it doesn't break down serotonin. It's activated by progesterone, so it breaks down serotonin. So the "in" route is increased by estrogen and the "out" route is decreased by estrogen. Progesterone has the opposite effect, protecting you against serotonin.

In our lab, we saw that estrogen treatment would cause the animals to first enlarge their adrenal cortex, activate it, cause intense stress adaptive reactions, and then the adrenal cortex would start bleeding and dying. The mechanism there has been worked out: the stress increases serotonin, serotonin increases the cortico-release factor that increases the pituitary hormone, which drives the adrenal cortex. So the stress, acting either through estrogen or serotonin, ends up overworking your adrenal cortex.

**Josh Rubin:** This is quite dangerous because a lot of women we work with are coming in on SSRIs, on synthetic estrogens, not eating the right foods, or they're starving themselves. So they're having these huge metabolic shifts. It's almost like what they're taking is pushing them towards exactly where they don't want to go.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's where the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) come in too. They are specifically effective at releasing tryptophan to enter the brain or other cells to produce more serotonin. The serotonin activates the enzymes that convert polyunsaturated fatty acids into the prostaglandins as sort of executors of the inflammatory process, amplifiers of it. Estrogen specifically interacts with the polyunsaturated fats so that the estrogen becomes more excitotoxic under the influence of unsaturated fats. And the unsaturated fats again are directed down the pathways towards inflammation under the influence of estrogen.

**Josh Rubin:** So the unsaturated fats increase brain uptake of L-tryptophan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Josh Rubin:** Is that why a lot of Western research shows that serotonin is a brain chemical? Because if you read a lot of the literature, most people don't say that serotonin is found in the gut, or if they do, it's a small amount.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That orientation comes from the drug industry exclusively. If they had been paying attention for the last hundred years, they would have known otherwise. But the pharmaceutical industry subsidizes and directs research where they want it to go. They don't want people noticing the diseases that would be cured or prevented if people would have a different understanding of what tryptophan, serotonin, estrogen, and polyunsaturated fats are doing. All of those happen to have their industrial investments that really very powerfully direct medical school research, newspaper publicity... everything is herded away from understanding that just about every acute or degenerative disease would be alleviated by controlling serotonin.

## SSRIs and Medical Misinterpretation

**Josh Rubin:** I'm sure there are a lot of people listening that are taking SSRIs. They think they're helping themselves. The Western thought is you need it because you have low levels of serotonin. And what you're saying is there's actually excess and making it worse. What are doctors basing their [prescriptions on]?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's really sort of fun to read the medical publications. Instead of measuring the amount of serotonin in the serum or the amount of breakdown product hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the urine and seeing correlations between that and symptoms...

For example, men with more than 100 nanograms per milliliter of serotonin in their blood serum tend to be imperfectly fertile or infertile or impotent the higher it goes. The normal range is said to be roughly 50 to 250 nanograms per milliliter, but men are sterile at the upper end of that. When you look at the amount produced by a cell being injured by radiation, it's below 25 nanograms per milliliter until it has been injured. So I would infer from those in vitro studies that everyone who has more than 25 nanograms per milliliter in their serum is experiencing some sort of inflammatory, degenerative process.

The articles, instead of looking at those correlations, will say they're measuring the total serotonin in the whole blood and say there's no difference between this group or that group. But it's absolutely decisive whether the serotonin is being bound in the platelets in the blood where it's being carried to the lungs to be destroyed, or whether it has leaked out of the platelets into the serum, where it can act on the wall of the blood vessel and the heart and the lung, causing hypertension and fibrosis.

They will look at the amount of the breakdown product, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in the urine. If it goes up, they'll say—depends on whether they see it corresponding to a good effect or bad effect—but they'll either say that it means that there's less serotonin in the brain when they see more in the urine, because if it's broken down, it can't be acting. In other words, they can choose what they want to interpret as happening in the brain by looking at something very remote, the breakdown product in the urine.

If your lungs are working effectively to destroy it, you'll see the breakdown product. If the lungs aren't working effectively, you won't see the breakdown product. So it'll look like you might not be experiencing serotonin stimulation when that's exactly why you're experiencing it, because you aren't forming the breakdown product.

## Melatonin and 5-HTP

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on the correlation between melatonin and serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** An Italian researcher has been seeing melatonin very closely associated with rheumatoid arthritis. High melatonin goes with high rheumatoid symptoms, and the inflammation of the rheumatoid arthritis is worse at night when the melatonin is high.

But melatonin is actually being produced in the inflamed arthritic joint or in the inflamed cancerous breast, for example. I interpret that not to mean that melatonin is causing the inflammation or the cancer, but that, like in the brain, serotonin is turned to melatonin. I think it's a detoxifying process. When stressed, if you can destroy the serotonin by this alternate route rather than by the monoamine oxidase route—if you can turn it to melatonin—then you've disposed of a good part of your inflammation problem.

**Josh Rubin:** Which one is a precursor to which? Melatonin is a precursor to serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, when you get rid of serotonin, you turn it into melatonin.

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of these people that are supplementing with melatonin, they think they're helping themselves, especially at night. They're actually putting themselves into an immune-suppressive state as well as stimulating cortisol, because serotonin stimulates cortisol. So the very thing they're doing to help with sleep is actually going to make it worse.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The difference of toxicity between serotonin and melatonin is so great. If you take 10 milligrams of melatonin, then that's going to be a problem. But a milligram or so is probably harmless. But the 5-hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTP) turns massively into serotonin. That's where people are going to get the problem.

**Josh Rubin:** So the 5-HTP that people are taking for maybe depression or help with sleep is what you're talking about?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. That's really much more dangerous than melatonin.

**Josh Rubin:** Because of its immune suppression and the stimulation of cortisol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and it turns to serotonin. I've recently talked to people who had eye problems, cataracts or glaucoma, who had been prescribed to take fish oil and 5-HTP. You can create cataracts almost instantly with a dose of serotonin. The serotonin is high in sick eyes with cataracts or glaucoma. The fish oils break down, increasing the formation of serotonin in the eye just as it happens in the blood and other tissues.

**Josh Rubin:** When we're talking about 5-HTP, I know there are people listening that are taking it for an emotional issue and feel like it helped mood or depression. What's the mechanism behind that? Is it helping at the expense of damaging the metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it happens to drive up their cortisol, cortisol makes everyone feel good temporarily by stopping inflammation. So that's one of the possible good feelings.

Some of the effects of the SSRIs are really surprising. Some of them do pretty directly increase your exposure to serotonin; you can find it in the body fluids after taking the drug. But they have treated aggressive dogs with one of the SSRIs and find that they work to decrease their aggressive viciousness. At the time that they become friendly dogs, they measure the amount of serotonin in their blood and find that it has decreased greatly.

That was one of the symptoms of the carcinoid people: in their last stages, they were often unmanageably aggressive. That whole thing about the anti-aggression, anti-anxiety, all of those happy associations... they look at something they want to look at rather than what's really present and acting in the system.

## Thyroid, CO2, and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about serotonin's correlation with the thyroid and CO2 levels? What does it do to lowering CO2 levels to lower thyroid production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Serotonin activates prolactin, for example, along with cortisol. When you're low in thyroid, your serotonin goes up, and the TSH is partly increased by the rising serotonin. Low thyroid people very often have increased prolactin as well as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Those both are increased by the rising serotonin from the low thyroid. People have high estrogen and low progesterone, and those are involved in causing the serotonin to rise.

Rising serotonin increases the prolactin and TSH. If your thyroid can't respond vigorously to correct the whole situation—bring up your progesterone, lower the estrogen, turn off the production of serotonin, and get your TSH and prolactin down—then you get stuck in this high TSH, high prolactin, high serotonin situation.

All of those things, the pituitary hormones included, create inflammation, promote clotting, the formation of lactic acid, and suppression of the mitochondrial respiration which produces carbon dioxide. So your whole energy system is pushed down when you get in that pattern.

The absence of carbon dioxide is a place where you can start. If you survived a polyunsaturated fat diet and were in good health—didn't have high serotonin or inflammatory problems, didn't have leaky blood vessels and water retention—if you just wanted to experiment and you hyperventilated for a minute, you would find that the loss of CO2 in your blood raised the pH in the blood platelets. The platelets are moving the serotonin to your lungs to be destroyed. The loss of carbon dioxide causes the platelets to spill their serotonin, causing blood capillaries and arterioles to dilate and become leaky. Within a minute, you can create a hyper-serotonemia edematous condition. Once you get that, then it tends to become self-perpetuating if it has become too intense.

**Josh Rubin:** So it's the damaged metabolism, maybe the bacterial overgrowth, the overburden of the liver, and the estrogen dominant thing that doesn't allow the liver to detox the serotonin, which increases serotonin levels and pushes people into this state.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And those changes make you hyperventilate, make you tend to lose even more carbon dioxide, and everything tends to reproduce itself, making the condition worse unless you intervene with thyroid or progesterone or carbon dioxide.

The carbon dioxide, besides holding the serotonin in place in the platelets, helps to detoxify and anti-inflame all the other parts of the system. It prevents the overproduction of adrenaline, for example. It tends to calm the whole system. You can sedate a person if you give them a fairly high amount of carbon dioxide. So it's acting on everything from your nervous system down to your bones in a stabilizing effect. At the other extreme, there's the lactic acid and serotonin that are destabilizing everything at all levels.

**Josh Rubin:** So could you say a lot of people who are being diagnosed with asthma are actually just hyperventilating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Women taking estrogen will tend to hyperventilate, have a slightly alkalotic condition, and that increases the release of serotonin and histamine. Those cause contraction of the muscles in your breathing system and will bring on everything from a slight phlegminess to tightness of the tubes, all the way up to terminal fibrosis of your respiratory system.

## Light and Darkness

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about light and what does light, or even darkness, have to do with serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The popularity of the morning light treatment... everything that makes someone feel good turns out they'll say, "Oh, that's because it's increasing your estrogen and your serotonin and your prostaglandins." Everything they have to sell, they'll say if you feel good after doing something, it's because you need more of our product.

It's the same with the light boxes. Getting enough light makes people feel good. So they say, "Oh, that's because it's increasing your serotonin." But in fact, the peak serotonin in the blood is at midnight in the winter. The enzymes that produce it and detoxify it are under the influence of light, too. So there are direct effects of light on the enzyme systems that regulate it. When you look at the end product being depressed and inflamed, the worst time is around midnight, and the worst season is in the winter. People get sick, tend to have strokes, depression... all kinds of diseases are exacerbated under the influence of darkness and high serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** We could say basically that light is more stimulatory to progesterone and darkness is more stimulatory towards estrogen, serotonin, and melatonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's been known for a long time, that it's the increased day length in the spring that makes animals fertile from rising progesterone. For example, they've mated an animal that has delayed implantation. They would mate the animals in the winter and then watch when the female actually became pregnant. It was about March 21st, when the days became as long as the nights. Suddenly the progesterone would rise to the point where she would implant and become pregnant.

**Josh Rubin:** I'm from Boston originally, and a lot of people in the winter get seasonal affective disorder because the days are shorter. So you can correlate that with people becoming almost serotonin dominant. If people got outside a little more, eliminated PUFAs from their diet, and maybe used light therapy later on in the day, you could downregulate the inflammatory effects of serotonin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There are direct effects that you can demonstrate in a cell. For example, sunlight—the ultraviolet part—will excite electrons and create free radicals. It takes usually several hours for those to fade out. But if you expose it to red light—in other words, let the penetrating rays get to the tissue—the free radicals are quenched almost instantly.

With animals, they can give them a lethal dose of gamma rays, and if they, within the first hour, expose them to red light, that quenches the excited electrons and stops the death process. When you get sunburned, your skin is being killed by the ultraviolet. But the red light is all that penetrates deeply. The red light from bright sunlight will go all the way through your trunk. We're semi-transparent to the red light because the only thing that absorbs it significantly is the respiratory enzyme. It's a blue enzyme that absorbs red light, which is our respiratory enzyme. That depends on thyroid function. That happens to be what is damaged by serotonin, estrogen, and free radicals.

## Exercise and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** One of the listeners has a question in regards to serotonin and exercise. They say that a lot of the popular articles say that aerobic exercise is good because it raises serotonin. Of course, we know you're not a fan of aerobic exercise. Is serotonin affected by exercise and what is the best kind to make sure that excess serotonin is not produced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there have been some experiments showing that resistance exercise of a very moderate sort—muscle building—is best for lowering inflammation and serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** So more of an anaerobic workout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Staying below the lactate threshold.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend anything nutritionally during a workout, pre or post, to downregulate serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugars. Keeping your cell energy up, producing carbon dioxide is the best way to minimize the serotonin.

**Josh Rubin:** Orange juice?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

## Endotoxin Explained

**Josh Rubin:** Let's move on to endotoxin. What is endotoxin? Can you explain it to the listeners?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Its technical name is lipopolysaccharide. It's some fatty acids of a specific kind attached to a short starch-like molecule, the polysaccharide. It's made by a whole variety of bacteria. The gram-negative type produce it, and it's part of their structure. As they live, they're building more structure and leaking some of this fat-starch molecule.

It's so representative of this whole category of bacteria that animals have evolved, apparently, to recognize the presence of lipopolysaccharide as the presence of bacteria. It activates the innate immune system to do things that defend against the bacteria.

It's a toxic effect that seems to be a physical effect on the cell rather than a chemical effect or even an immunological effect. It seems to have a soaping-type action on cells that destabilizes them, lets them know that they've been irritated. That amount of physical irritation is enough to activate things like the production of serotonin, release of histamine, the activation of proteolytic enzyme systems, and creating a shower of things that are part of our very basic defense against bacteria.

We've adapted to living with it so that it's sort of a stimulus. When it's in the right amount, it tones up the system and gets things running. We normally can destroy all of it that gets into the bloodstream by the time it gets to the liver. But if your liver is overworked or under-energized, then the endotoxin gets through in your bloodstream, where it starts having this irritating, destabilizing effect all through your system.

Its direct effect on the cell destabilizes it enough that it lowers mitochondrial energy production and forces the cell to shift over to lactic acid production. So it's acting directly in harmful ways that start the leaky process, letting stuff leak out of your bloodstream into the surrounding tissues. You can demonstrate that it makes problems like multiple sclerosis worse by letting more stuff leak through the barrier into the brain.

Starting right at the intestine, if the intestine is in very great condition, it can stop the endotoxin before it gets to your liver. And your liver is the next layer of defense. But at each of these, every place the endotoxin reaches, it activates the serotonin and other innate inflammatory reactions. And those include nitric oxide, which goes with a shower of mutual excitation. Endotoxin, serotonin, nitric oxide, and the prostaglandins—these are things that normally are under control and don't do much harm. But once they reach a certain level of interaction and promotion of each other, then they all add up to suppression of our oxidative metabolic system.

**Josh Rubin:** So something as simple as the stress reaction from excess cortisol production could cause an increased production of endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Increased absorption of it, yeah.

**Josh Rubin:** And from there is an onslaught...

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A lot of starchy food. Undercooked cereals and poorly cooked vegetable material will feed the bacteria, increase their production of it.

**Josh Rubin:** And then that excess production of endotoxin increases serotonin release from the intestine, and then that cascade of everything we just talked about. There's a high correlation between endotoxin and serotonin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, very close. I think that's probably the closest way to account for the gradient increasing serotonin as you move from the stomach to the appendix. I think that's because of the increasing production of endotoxins.

**Josh Rubin:** Beside eating the wrong foods, like undercooked cereals and unsaturated foods, what else causes an increase?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The things that are high in phosphate have some of the overlapping effects with the inflammatory things. Calcium, if you have a high ratio of calcium to phosphate, happens to suppress the fermentation of fiber and starch in the intestine. So high calcium intake will actually reduce the production of the endotoxin as well as reducing the consequences of your reaction to the endotoxin.

Having some fat in your food does various things that can be helpful. There's a germicidal effect of the fatty acids that helps to keep the intestine sterile. You should be able to absorb your fat by roughly half to two-thirds of the way down your small intestine, where it's still sterile. But if you eat fat with the fiber, the fat helps to suppress the bacteria and it can help the fiber persist and go all the way through your intestine. So it can turn what would be a harmful fiber supporting endotoxin into a useful sort of a bowel-stimulating bulk former.

**Josh Rubin:** So even cereals, uncooked foods, unsaturated fats, carrageenan, gums, beans—all those things can actually cause the overproduction of endotoxin. And going back to the foods that actually protect against it, that's where eggshells and dairy come into play.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I don't know that these things could protect you even against carrageenan. But against real foods. I think if they're really trying to poison us by putting carrageenan in our whipped cream and lunch meats, they'll succeed.

## Calcium Sources

**Josh Rubin:** What are the best sources of calcium for people?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Powdered eggshells really are by far the next best to milk and cheese. In the case of milk, you have both the fat and the lactose helping to absorb the calcium. In the case of the powdered eggshell, at least it's in the form of calcium carbonate, which is the form that it's going to be most beneficial. Calcium carbonate is how calcium is integrated into the bone.

I think the reason they see some counterproductive effects from calcium supplementation is that they're using such strange things as pills for nutritional supplements: calcium phosphate, orotate, gluconate, aspartate, and so on. You don't want to use any of those. The calcium carbonate from eggshell is very pure and the right chemical.

## The Carrot Salad

**Josh Rubin:** You've talked about carrots and bamboo shoots before to help the body detoxify against estrogen, serotonin, and endotoxin. Can you explain why you recommend a raw carrot versus a cooked carrot?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The cooking does something to make the carrot fiber acceptable to bacteria, and the bacteria will thrive on cooked carrot, whereas almost no microorganism can multiply on a raw carrot. From a cooked carrot, you absorb almost all of the carotene, and the carotene has an antithyroid action. You do get more potassium, calcium, magnesium out of the cooked carrot. But the point of the carrot isn't nutrition. It's to help cleanse your intestine.

**Josh Rubin:** It's more medicinal in a sense.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Josh Rubin:** What about keto proteins? In one of your newsletters on serotonin, you talk about keto acids from potatoes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. These are the equivalent carbon framework of the essential amino acids, but they lack the ammonia needed to make the complete essential amino acid. Potato happens to be very rich in these. We juiced a potato and ran it on paper chromatograph and saw that it was very rich in all of the equivalents of the essential amino acids. But when you test it chemically, it has a very low amount of protein.

When you eat it, these keto acids are changed once they get into your bloodstream just by absorbing ammonia; they change into the essential amino acids and can support protein synthesis. So if a person has very low kidney function and can't get rid of a lot of urea, instead of needing dialysis, if they eat these keto acids instead of protein, they can recycle their ammonia over and over instead of making it into urea that needs to be excreted.

Potatoes are a very rich source of this protein equivalent such that if you mash two pounds of potatoes, you can think of it as being equivalent to a quart of milk for protein value. And it also has a good balance of all the other nutrients. So if you juice it and get rid of the starch, then you have an extremely concentrated, high-value nutrient.

## Moles and Thyroid Function

**Josh Rubin:** One of the listeners asked if you know any correlation or cause of raised moles in regards to unsaturated fat and serotonin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was just reading some articles on the handling of tryptophan and serotonin by pigmented moles and other pigmented skin. It's just starting to be investigated, but I've had a lot of experience with just the effect of thyroid and related hormones on moles.

A couple of doctors in about 1980 told me I should have a biopsy on a mole that had become big and rough and totally black. I was experimenting with DHEA and progesterone at the time and knew that I didn't want to get involved with cancer specialists. After I'd been experimenting with the steroids, I saw what looked like a maraschino cherry where the mole had been. Over the next three or four days, the inflammation went out of it. And what was left was a small brown mole that I had had all my life in that place that had wanted to turn into a melanoma.

Since then, every time I have become hypothyroid from not taking a thyroid supplement, I notice that I get moles growing. I've probably had 20 or 25 that would easily be diagnosed as melanomas—for example, a white mole with a blue and black spot that changes position every three or four hours. Extremely turbulent metabolic activity just churning around, changing shape and colors. Those disappear in just a matter of hours or days adjusting the thyroid and progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA.

## Anemia and Candida

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate a little bit more on anemia in correlation with the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Broda Barnes brought that to my attention. He believed that hypothyroidism was usually the cause of anemia and probably never recommended an iron supplement. He cited an experiment in which rats—whose tailbones never make red blood cells normally—their tail was inserted through a little nick in their abdominal wall and sewed inside their body. Later, after staying at core body temperature for a couple of weeks, they took the bones out and found that they were producing red cells, just like their rib bones or hip bones. It's simply a matter of temperature. If your extremities are cold, the wounds are too cold to make blood cells. Low thyroid people, even if their core temperature stays up, their extremities tend to get very cold.

**Josh Rubin:** Another question from a listener is in regard to candida or yeast overgrowth. Can you elaborate on that and its relation to serotonin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The candida normally is harmless in the intestine, but like the other organisms, it shouldn't be living very abundantly above your colon. Low thyroid people sometimes have candida growing even in their stomachs. When they drink anything sugary, they brew beer or wine in their stomach and can make so much that they get drunk every time they eat sugar. Ordinarily, they shouldn't be living there, and that's mainly because your thyroid function is low.

But if you want to make a yeast angry, don't feed it sugar. A yeast needs sugar to grow normally. When it's deficient in sugar, it will sense sugar in your intestine or in the blood. It will drill holes in your intestine and send filaments down into your intestine to get some glucose, which it needs. But if you keep feeding the yeast sugar, the worst you will get is a little drunk.

**Josh Rubin:** That's kind of opposite to what most people recommend. They say sugar feeds fungus, so starve it and it will go away. But in reality, you actually need it to downregulate it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But the raw carrot is a very good antiseptic for candida and other fungus. We've seen people who had the typical high estrogen, high cortisol, premenstrual syndrome, and in just three or four days of the carrot salad, have another blood test and everything is normal. The carrot is preventing the reabsorption of estrogen, which is blocking your liver function and your thyroid function. The carrot, by eliminating the endotoxin, lets your thyroid and other glands function properly to bring up your progesterone and lower your estrogen and cortisol.

**Josh Rubin:** For the listeners, when you say carrot salad, do you just mean a shaved carrot? Is there anything else in there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Raw is good. But if you want it to be really antiseptic, you shred it lengthwise, preferably, because the length of the fiber is important. You don't want to put it in a blender. You want quite a bit of the fiber to be intact. Add a few drops to a spoonful of vinegar without additives, and an oil—olive oil, just a teaspoon or so—improves the taste. Either coconut or olive oil will have a germicidal action. Normally you would absorb the oil high up in your intestine and it wouldn't get as far as the bacteria in the lower intestine. So the carrot absorbs some of the germicidal acetic acid and olive oil or coconut oil carries them along with it, and its own intrinsic germicide is increased by these other antifungal chemicals.

**Josh Rubin:** Same thing with the bamboo shoots? But with the bamboo shoots you recommend cutting up and cooking them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I've never tried raw bamboo shoots, but they're a very interesting vegetable. I like them with a cheese or egg sauce.

## Pregnancy and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** Is there anything else, Ray, you want to talk about in regards to serotonin and endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Keep in mind that the so-called scientific community, the corporate product research community, is very determined to keep the public thinking a certain way about estrogen and serotonin. They never mention certain topics and they always try to read the data so it looks like it's beneficial even when it isn't.

If you think of anything bad, you might consider what the role of estrogen and serotonin is in relation to that. For example, ergot was used to produce abortions. Ergot derivatives and serotonin are involved in impaired fertility, lack of sperm formation in men, birth defects if a woman is exposed to high serotonin while pregnant, and difficult delivery because of high serotonin causing reduced circulation.

The whole preeclampsia syndrome is very centered on high serotonin. When fat women have a problem with pregnancy, it's typically because the estrogen and serotonin are reducing circulation to the uterus. Practically any problem that people have, if you investigate it, it's going to turn out to involve those three types of systems: the prostaglandins/fatty acids, the serotonin/tryptophan system, and the estrogen stress system.

**Josh Rubin:** It's kind of scary because everyone is taking estrogens and synthetic estrogens and SSRIs. And infertility is up, C-sections, preeclampsia, weight gain. It's almost like the very thing that people are trying to build up is actually breaking them down.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The famous brain degenerative diseases—Huntington's disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease—these all involve the serotonin effects. Forty years ago, someone identified increased serotonin as a demyelinating factor as well as a blood vessel leakiness factor released by platelets that concentrate around the plaques in multiple sclerosis. All of those are increased by high estrogen and high prolactin and tend to be corrected by progesterone and thyroid. But all of the stuff that has been known very clearly demonstrated 30, 40, 50 years ago, the drug science culture manages to get everyone to forget.

**Josh Rubin:** What about vitamin E and aspirin? You talked about decreased circulation in the uterus. And I know you talk about aspirin actually increasing circulation in the uterus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And it's gradually being used more to treat preeclampsia and pregnancy problems. It's very, very powerful against serotonin in many of the ways that thyroid works. Aspirin and thyroid and some of the sugars, like fructose, work in the same ways against serotonin. In an animal model of the very serious lung disease, pulmonary artery hypertension, they can cure it just with aspirin. And cancers of various types are promoted by serotonin and inhibited or cured by aspirin.

**Josh Rubin:** Everyone listening, that doesn't mean go out and start popping aspirin. Make sure you know what you're doing. But if used correctly, it can be very beneficial.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the aspirin is filling in for a lack of the other natural things: calcium, thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone, carbon dioxide.

## Libido and Niacinamide

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked about serotonin's effect on libido and what a male could do to raise libido by lowering serotonin. Is it just by increasing calcium, eliminating unsaturated fats, increasing saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, all of those anti-inflammatory things. And keeping your carbon dioxide up high by not doing aerobic exercise I think is very important. Sometimes the thyroid is the crucial missing thing. Sometimes vitamin B6 is all it takes to get things going very suddenly. Niacinamide to inhibit the free fatty acids—that in most people are mostly polyunsaturated. Niacinamide, especially if you accompany it with orange juice to reduce the breakdown of fat from your deposits, can stop the stress enough to get your thyroid and androgens going again.

**Josh Rubin:** Have you ever seen a dose of niacinamide cause GI upset or diarrhea?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, I've never known of that with the niacinamide form. The old nicotinic acid that makes people turn red—what it's doing is increasing the release of serotonin and activating prostaglandin production, stuff you don't want to happen. Even the kind they call "no flush" niacin—inositol hexanicotinate I think is its name—it still releases nicotinic acid which releases serotonin, whereas the niacinamide doesn't do that. Even the slow release or the nicotinic acid are for sure going to increase the risk of diarrhea by increasing your serotonin and prostaglandins.

## Fibrosis and Calcification

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can find an old book with Hans Selye's work in it, you will find some interesting stuff on serotonin and the calcifying diseases and the fibrotic diseases. He was very quick to assimilate serotonin into his study of inflammation and stress.

**Josh Rubin:** Is that with its correlation with prolactin and calcium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It does many things to cause calcification. It increases the parathyroid hormone even, which takes calcium out of your bones and puts it in your blood vessels and kidneys where you don't want it. Hans Selye demonstrated that it would calcify the skin, turn a rat's skin into like a turtle shell.

**Josh Rubin:** So obviously it would be increasing calcium intake to downregulate that internal excretion to downregulate parathyroid hormone.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And sodium is sometimes the missing factor. All of the trace minerals. I advocate some kind of seafood once a week to get your selenium and copper, for example. The copper is needed for the thyroid to work in the respiratory enzyme. Selenium is needed for the thyroid to work in the deiodinase systems.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend specific types of salt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Clean salt without additives. I use Morton's canning and pickling salt. Seems okay.

**Josh Rubin:** What are your thoughts on the Celtic or the Himalayan salts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The red color in the Himalayan stuff is iron mostly. And where you find iron, you're likely to find worse heavy metals.

**Josh Rubin:** And then what about like a gray Celtic sea salt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's basically French mud that makes it gray. Usually there's quite a bit of mineral content. Anything from the English Channel is now likely to have uranium. They're dumping their nuclear waste into the channel.

## Upcoming Topics

**Josh Rubin:** Anything else, Ray, you want to elaborate on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The current newsletter is going out in about a week on osteoporosis and how serotonin fits into that. And the one I'm starting next is going to be on sugars, especially fructose, because of the craziness that is circulating in the culture now, telling people to fear fruit even.

**Josh Rubin:** It is pretty crazy. Just a quick question on osteoporosis and serotonin. Is it its correlation with the parathyroid hormone and prolactin in calcification and its correlation with estrogen and cortisol that lead to osteoporosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. They were noticing that people on the SSRIs for a few years were getting exaggerated degrees of osteoporosis. That led the people who had been looking for products... these people were looking in all of the wrong places. They would find something that they thought would work like estrogen to prevent osteoporosis according to their way of looking at the world sideways. And then it would turn out that their product caused fibrosis of the lungs, promoted cancer, and even was associated with osteoporosis increasing.

One of the groups that had been working on the genetics, trying to find products, basically said when they looked up and noticed that the intestine was the source of the serotonin that was causing the osteoporosis, they said they "rediscovered whole animal physiology."

## Caller Question: Red Light Therapy

**Josh Rubin:** We do have a caller. Caller from 253, you're on.

**Justin (Caller):** My question was for Ray to possibly elaborate upon what he talked about earlier in regard to the healing effects of the red light. I live in the Pacific Northwest and, as Ray is familiar with up in Oregon, we have long, seemingly very stressful winters with not much light, a lot of cloud cover. I was looking for some practical applications for the use of that light. I've heard of the 250-watt infrared lights. Just a practical guide of what he would do.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With the mercury vapor ultraviolet lights, you have to be really careful that you don't get sunburn that will cause you to make vitamin D. I personally prefer to use a little vitamin D, absorbing it through my skin, rather than try to fiddle with a safe amount of ultraviolet light exposure. But it does work for keeping your parathyroid hormone down under control and your calcium where it should be. Eating excess calcium is very helpful for regulating the parathyroid hormone that tends to rise in the winter. So I think we need more calcium during the winter in a cold, dark northern climate.

You can get these 130-volt reflector bulbs, meaning that they're designed to run on a higher voltage than the standard 120. So on the normal voltage, they produce an orange-colored light that's very poor in the blue part of the spectrum and very rich in the red and orange part. That's biologically good. And since they produce a lot of heat with less of the bright white light, they help to heat a room in the winter. I have two of them aimed at the area where I work, and two of them are generally enough to keep a room warm even in cold weather. But it wouldn't hurt to have three of them, 750 watts, aimed at you for your general well-being.

**Josh Rubin:** So they're 130-volt reflective bulbs, usually about 250 watts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. They call them infrared, which just means they're designed for a different voltage.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** We've got about 10 minutes left. I think that was a great show. We really appreciate you coming on Ray. Did you want to add any more to the serotonin endotoxin topic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, the antidepressant thing. Did I mention the dog that was found to have low serotonin? The things that lower your serotonin are likely to make you less aggressive but happier. One of the interpretations of what serotonin is doing, that I think makes sense—the person who founded the line of thinking was named Cloninger—is that the behavioral system for harm avoidance and general behavioral inhibition is what serotonin is doing. So when you reduce your overproduction of serotonin, you stop thinking about harm avoidance and have a more positive, constructive, exploratory attitude.

**Josh Rubin:** So you're saying the lower the better.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the lower the better.

**Josh Rubin:** That's so great. It's opposite of what everyone's saying.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's pretty much an intentional thing. The business culture took over science after the 1940s. There used to be a lot of doctors around who knew how to use thyroid and cure arthritis and insanity and dementia and everything with thyroid. But they were educated before the Second World War. Then the corporations took over the medical schools. Everyone educated since the 1950s doesn't know any of that stuff about thyroid.

The serotonin issue came in really with the introduction of fraudulent science governed by the pharmaceutical industry with their estrogen theory. A whole theory of aging and stress was invented by the estrogen industry. That was already established for about 15 years when serotonin came on the scene. So they worked serotonin into the system so that it didn't impair the advertising campaigns for estrogen. The whole system reinforces itself. The way science is done and the way things are interpreted is all designed really just to support the advertising system of the drug industry.

**Josh Rubin:** So buy any book before 1950 and not anything after 1950.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, you have to be very careful with the stuff after the 1950s.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you recommend any other books or people just off the top of your head in regards to serotonin or endotoxin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, not on those subjects. You just have to be critical and look for how they're arguing. They'll basically say anything. When you say this product "improves" the situation or "ameliorates" it rather than "increases" or "decreases"... if they say simply it changes it, increases it, or decreases it, they might be honest. But when they say that they're "improving" the enzyme function of the rat, you can suspect that they have some product in mind. About 90% of the things you run across in the general journals are biased very heavily. But by the time it's filtered through the television and newspaper system, then it's like about 98 to 2 for the industry and against science.

**Josh Rubin:** It's tough. I guess that's why we stick with your articles. Well, I think we're about to wrap it up. Really appreciate you coming on. Have a good weekend, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you. Bye.

**Josh Rubin:** So another great show, guys. Ray Peat on serotonin and endotoxin. It's a lot to take in. Definitely listen to the show over again. If you get questions, email us. You can email Ray. Like I said, just make sure you compensate him for his time.

Just keep in mind his philosophy is based on science and how the body works. It's not a diet, it's not "do this to lose weight." It's based on the human body, how it works, what the body needs, what it can break down, and what's going to facilitate the metabolism, reduce inflammation, and not cause disease.

There's so much going on out there about what Ray thinks and what people should eat. Just realize that he doesn't truly have a "plan" and everything out there is people's interpretation of his work. Just study it, practice it, and realize it takes time, effort, and consistency to fine-tune and meet your body's metabolic needs every single meal.

Thanks for tuning in. Stay tuned to our Facebook and YouTube for our next show with Ray next month. I'm out of here.
