## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Today we are hosting a great show with Dr. Raymond Peat. The show is on cholesterol and saturated fats, so we will cover why cholesterol is so important, why doctors try to lower it, why our physiology needs it, and what it means if it is high or low. We will also discuss why the right types of saturated fats are so important in our diet. Dr. Peat, could you give a brief history of who you are and where you come from?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology, I was mostly studying language, literature, and painting. I had been interested in biology for a very long time, but I had a bad impression of academic biology from my high school experience. In the 1940s, there was a very big change in the nature of American biology that was powered by industry and government promotion of the gene theory as opposed to the field theory in development and health.

I waited until 1968 to enter a graduate program in biology. I had learned enough about universities to manage to get through the program without having too many conflicts with professors. Most of the professors were committed to the genetic determinist idea of what an organism is. I was interested in the field concept and environmental influences on the organism. Nutrition is one of the most important environmental influences. I see our nature as being a matter of potential being realized according to the conditions of the environment, rather than the expression of a predetermined genetic program.

## The History of Cholesterol Fear

**Josh Rubin:** Why do you think America is so afraid of cholesterol and saturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it is driven primarily by the food industry wanting to sell their products. The seed oils were already seen to be toxic—causing sterility, degeneration of the brain and the gonads—probably from 1925, but especially in the 1930s and 40s. The very oxidizable seed oils were known to be toxic. That was one of the factors in researching Vitamin E as something to counteract the toxicity of the seed oils, as well as the toxicity of estrogen, which happens to synergize with unsaturated fats.

The pig industry had been looking for ways to make their animals gain weight and eat less food. George Burr, who is identified as the inventor of the essential fatty acid concept, discovered that the essential fatty acids slow the metabolic rate. Deficient animals eating sugar instead of unsaturated fats had about a 50% higher metabolic rate. They found that feeding soy and corn to the pigs, because of the unsaturated fats suppressing their metabolic rate, increased the profit—less food in, more pig out. At the same time, they noticed that it was lowering cholesterol as one of its biological, toxic effects.

Around 1950, paint and plastic chemists discovered how to make their products from petroleum, which decreased the market for seed oils. They wanted to find new markets to replace the paint and plastics market, so they started promoting the health idea of their soy oil, cottonseed oil, and safflower seed oil. The only biological effect established for the seed oils, other than sterility and dementia, was that they lowered blood cholesterol.

For several decades, people had noticed that cholesterol accumulated in the walls of blood vessels—atherosclerosis. The first person who discovered that in rabbits had dissolved the cholesterol in unsaturated vegetable oil. He realized that cholesterol by itself wasn't causing the disease. However, the seed oil industry argued by association: if cholesterol is in the hardened arteries and the blood, and their oil lowers the level in the blood, then you can prevent the disease. But the very people who had made those discoveries realized that wasn't so. In the 1930s, people found that thyroid was enough to prevent atherosclerosis, and at the same time, it lowered cholesterol.

Over the last 10 or 15 years, a Swedish doctor named Uffe Ravnskov has shown that there is no causal connection between atherosclerosis, heart disease, and the triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood. The experiments done in the 30s showed that hypothyroidism and the associated metabolic changes caused the atherosclerosis. The cholesterol seems to be there as a defensive reaction to protect the injured blood vessels.

## Saturated vs. Unsaturated Fats

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It refers to the chain of carbon atoms in the fatty acid. In one case, they have all of the hydrogen atoms attached to them that are possible; they are saturated with hydrogen. If some of the carbon atoms lack the hydrogen, they have their electron bonds more exposed to the environment. The absence of the hydrogen makes them more flexible. Instead of being like a bottle brush bristling with the hydrogen surrounding the chain of carbons, it's more like a necklace of beads—flexible.

Where the hydrogens are missing, the bonds can rotate more freely. If you get several of those double bonds, the chain is bent at each place. That flexibility is biologically important. Coconut oil is hard at room temperature because it is relatively saturated. Olive oil has to be cooler before it solidifies. Canola and corn oil have to be extremely cold before they solidify.

If an organism lives at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and contained butterfat, its fats would be solid and unmanageable. In the tropics, even fish in the Amazon river have fat as saturated as butterfat. Chocolate and coconuts grow in places where the temperature averages close to 90 degrees, so they need to have very saturated fat just for biochemical manipulation. If you had unsaturated fat in a fish in the Amazon river, the fish would oxidize its fats in just a couple of days.

Even with a medium unsaturated oil, such as soy or corn oil, if you put a rubber hose into a cork in the top of the bottle and put the other end in water, the water will rise up the tube as the oil consumes oxygen. It is a constant process. At body temperature (98 degrees), the process is much faster, and you get sticky, rancid oil very quickly.

## Atherosclerosis and Stress

**Josh Rubin:** What are your thoughts on atherosclerosis and heart disease?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) we unavoidably get in our diet are constantly breaking down, producing free radicals and tending to cause inflammation and tissue injury. If anything disturbs the metabolism of a cell, that is more likely to happen.

The normal, healthy oxidation through the mitochondrion keeps electrons tightly controlled. But if you take away some of the oxygen, the electrons will escape as free radical potentiators. Any stress on a cell puts out these electrons that can attack the exposed electron bonds in unsaturated fats. Saturated fats aren't open for stray electrons.

These reactions form lumps of material called age pigment or lipofuscin. These oxidized fat fragments attach to proteins and collect bits of iron. These lumps of age pigment, because of their iron and fat fragments, can catalyze the consumption of energy and waste oxygen. This creates a false mitochondrial effect.

Before that happens, signals go out changing the conditions of the organism—activating hormones such as cortisol, estrogen, and growth hormone. These three hormones are closely connected to rising triglycerides and damage to the blood vessel wall. Cortisol increases estrogen, estrogen increases cortisol, and they both increase growth hormone. All of these tend to break down triglycerides into free fatty acids, which are more reactive and tend to become oxidized more quickly.

## Cholesterol and Stress Hormones

**Josh Rubin:** Why does cholesterol go up when one is stressed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pituitary senses something wrong and increases ACTH, which drives the adrenal glands to take up cholesterol and synthesize it into pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and finally cortisol. Cortisol has a short-term defensive reaction against stress; one of its main effects is to turn protein into sugar for energy.

The increased production of cholesterol itself is a primitive, defensive, anti-stress system. Starting around 1920, people tried to purify cholesterol to see its biological effects. They used about 10 different toxins—from pus to snake venom to heavy metals. They found that if they gave a lethal dose of the poison to an animal but also gave it a good dose of cholesterol, it would survive. Cholesterol has a direct activating effect on producing defensive steroids and interfering with the toxic effects of chemical and physical stresses.

**Josh Rubin:** If cholesterol goes up under stress but never comes down, is that a conversion issue?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 40 years ago, researchers found that if thyroid hormone and Vitamin A nutrition were adequate, the amount of progesterone coming out of an ovary or adrenal gland exactly corresponded to the amount of cholesterol going in. A very big portion of cholesterol is turned into protective hormones. This depends largely on thyroid and Vitamin A.

In the 1930s, it was noticed that when the thyroid gland was removed, cholesterol immediately went up. If you gave a thyroid supplement, the cholesterol would decrease. Blood cholesterol was a mirror image of thyroid function.

If you lack something needed to turn energy into cholesterol, such as sugar, or if you are overloaded with unsaturated fats, you might not produce enough cholesterol. Sometimes a supplement of sugar is needed to bring up your production of cholesterol. You don't want your cholesterol to get below 160. A Hungarian study found that when they chemically lowered cholesterol, mortality increased from all causes—accidents, suicide, and cancer.

## Pregnenolone and Brain Chemistry

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on pregnenolone's effects on our brain chemistry?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several signals tell your brain that you are suffering stress, such as low blood sugar. The stressed brain will activate enzymes to produce GABA, which sedates the brain. Valium acts on the GABA stabilizing system. If something prevents glutamic acid from being turned into sufficient amounts of GABA, Valium will fill in.

Progesterone and pregnenolone act on the GABA receptor system. Pregnenolone is basically a stabilizer at all levels of cells in the brain. Its effect is to imitate Valium, telling your pituitary that the stress is under control and to stop producing so much cortisol. In early experiments, animals given a huge dose of pregnenolone were more normal after the dose than they were before, even if they had been stressed.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend using a pregnenolone supplement to help balance that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It depends on how far the system has deteriorated. Russians found that giving isolated mitochondria pregnenolone would structurally restore damaged mitochondria and allow them to begin producing more pregnenolone. There is a positive feedback: you give it some, and it makes more.

## Growth Hormone and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** Why is growth hormone inflammatory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most research is designed to praise its beneficial effects, but people who have been chronically deficient in it have a remarkable absence of atherosclerosis. Mice that are genetically deficient in pituitary hormones live two or three times as long as normal mice.

When you have hypoglycemia, you increase your growth hormone. It tends to come with other pituitary stress-responsive hormones. They are beneficial in the right amount at the right time, but harmful when they go on too long. People with acromegaly (overactivity of the pituitary) have an extremely high incidence of atherosclerosis.

## HDL vs. LDL

**Josh Rubin:** Can you explain the differences between HDL and LDL?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Both are able to participate in detoxification. The protein that helps carry the cholesterol has specific anti-stress and antiviral activity. LDL is mostly the one that carries cholesterol into the places where it is needed—the brain, ovaries, testicles, and adrenal glands. HDL has some more specific antitoxic effects. Toxins will tend to increase HDL relative to LDL because of those antitoxic effects.

## Light Therapy and Metabolism

**Josh Rubin:** How does lack of light cause an increase in cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As soon as the lights go off, cortisol begins rising. The stress system recognizes immediately that darkness is stress. Intrinsic oxidation and free radical production get out of control in proportion to the exposure to darkness.

When you measure cytochrome oxidase—the enzyme that delivers food electrons to oxygen—during darkness, it degrades. After 12 to 15 hours of darkness, mitochondria swell up and some explode. Red light penetrates tissue and restores the copper in the cytochrome oxidase enzyme to its proper functional role. It recharges the enzyme.

**Josh Rubin:** So light stimulates cellular respiration and progesterone, while darkness is more stimulatory towards estrogen and stress hormones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

## Caller: Immune System and Niacinamide

**Caller (JP):** I have a friend who contracted HIV. His last blood test showed CD4 and CD8 dropped. Do you have something to help him? What about niacinamide?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People with HIV often have very high polyunsaturated fats circulating. Niacinamide is something that will help lower the free fatty acids. Sugar, niacinamide, and aspirin are all things that help to lower the stress and keep the immune system up.

## Coconut Oil and Liver Health

**Josh Rubin:** You are a huge proponent of coconut oil. Can you elaborate on why?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any of the saturated fats have an anti-inflammatory, protective effect. A group studying liver disease found that fish oils and seed oils increase liver inflammation and fibrosis. This can be blocked by saturated fats. Alcoholics in India who consumed ghee or butter didn't develop liver cirrhosis despite being alcoholic. Alcohol activates unsaturated fats to react with iron and produce liver damage.

Coconut oil is in the medium chain length. The shortness of the chain means it is very mobile. The shorter saturated fats can be handled in the mitochondria without relying on the transport systems used for longer chains. They can be oxidized as easily as glucose. They interfere with the anti-metabolic effects of unsaturated fats, allowing the mitochondria to run at full speed. This works as if you are giving a thyroid supplement.

**Josh Rubin:** Does coconut oil affect the pancreas?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coconut oil and sugar work similarly to keep the system working to allow insulin both to function and to be produced.

## Milk, Calcium, and Parathyroid Hormone

**Josh Rubin:** Why is milk so important?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the calcium content is what makes it anti-inflammatory. Calcium increases the oxygen-using ability of the mitochondria, similar to thyroid. Systemically, it suppresses the parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a stress hormone that, when continued too long, contributes to degenerative diseases. Having a chronically high calcium intake gives you a chronically low parathyroid level, which protects your arteries, kidneys, and bones.

## Eggs

**Josh Rubin:** Why are eggs an important staple?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With the industrialization of the egg industry, the cholesterol content went down and the polyunsaturated content went up. If you can get non-industrial eggs from chickens that have pastures, they are going to be a lot better. The cholesterol in the egg seems to be one of its important nutritional values. 600 milligrams of cholesterol in your diet increases the oxidative stability of your lipid particles in your bloodstream.

## Caller: Free Fatty Acids

**Caller (Danny Roddy):** A lot of people in the Paleo sphere are under the impression that free fatty acids in the blood are a good thing. Can you explain why that might be harmful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is my main argument against eating a high meat diet. Free fatty acids are one of the means by which stress causes its damage. Just about everything that goes wrong involves free fatty acid increase. Even if they are totally saturated, they still tend to shift the mitochondrial metabolism away from using glucose and fructose, lowering carbon dioxide production.

## Caller: Cholesterol and Mitochondria

**Caller (Liam):** What does cholesterol have to do with mitochondrial respiration?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** First, it stabilizes and protects the mitochondria against free fatty acids. It actually stimulates respiration and oxygen consumption. The proteins that make up the mitochondrion have a very liquid property; that protein structure is reinforced and stabilized by binding with cholesterol molecules.

## Caller: Coconut Oil Sensitivity

**Caller (415):** A lot of coconut oil makes some people feel sick or achy. Is that because of salicylates? Is it better to get refined oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I recommend the completely deodorized coconut oil. The research was always done with the filtered kind that had no odor. Some people are allergic to the aromatic compounds in the coconut. Also, low thyroid people have very touchy gallbladders. It just takes a little grease to trigger a gallbladder reaction.

## Gut Health and Fatty Acids

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked about butyric and propionic acid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Those are produced in the intestine by fermenting bacteria. They have a protective effect against cancer, but since they are produced by bacteria, and healthy people have no bacteria in their small intestine, ideally we shouldn't be making them there. Both butyric and propionic acid have some pro-inflammatory effects as well.

## The Dangers of Statins

**Josh Rubin:** What is the risk of taking a statin and lowering cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tendency to become violent, suicidally depressed, or demented. Cholesterol is an intrinsic part of chromosome and DNA function. Statins interfere with the whole chain of synthesis, including Coenzyme Q10 production. This is likely a factor in why they cause muscles to break down (rhabdomyolysis).

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** To summarize, what can people do to normalize their cholesterol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A daily raw carrot will tend to lower cortisol and estrogen; stopping that stress will let your thyroid work better. Avoiding polyunsaturated fats is essential for your thyroid to recover. Everything that increases your metabolic rate, such as calcium and sodium, is essential.

**Josh Rubin:** Any final thoughts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The important thing is not to think of unsaturated fats as essential. That has never been proved. George Burr proved that unsaturated fats slow the metabolic rate. When you shift to a pro-thyroid saturated fat diet, your metabolic rate increases, which means your nutritional requirements for things like copper, selenium, and B vitamins will increase.

**Josh Rubin:** Thank you, Ray. That was an awesome show.
