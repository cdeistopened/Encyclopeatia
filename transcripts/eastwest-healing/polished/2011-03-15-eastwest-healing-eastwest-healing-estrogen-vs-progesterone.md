## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome to Holistic Living. We have Ray Peat on every month, and we want to say thank you to him. Before we introduce Ray, I want to mention that Ray's approach is not just an approach; it's a philosophy and a science. It is a science of how the body works—its biochemistry, biology, and physiology. It's not an "outside-in" type of diet like Paleolithic dieting or vegetarianism. It's based on the science of how the body works.

His articles are technical. It's like finding Waldo and piecing things together. Don't think that just because you eat gelatin, carrots, and broth, you're going to become healthy and lose weight immediately. It is a process.

Today we are talking about estrogen versus progesterone. You can go to Ray Peat's site, RayPeat.com. He has a PhD in Biology from the University of Oregon and specializes in physiology. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones back in 1968. Ray, welcome back.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Very good, thank you.

## The History of Estrogen and Stress Research

**Josh Rubin:** Let's get to it. We're going to be talking about estrogen and progesterone today. What sparked your interest in the hormonal field back in the 1960s?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It started when I was a kid noticing things. One of the old-timers in the woods pointed out that when they wanted a pine tree to bear seeds, they would chop it with an axe, and that made it bear fruit. I heard stories about how stress would bring on puberty prematurely.

Those ideas started blending with what I was seeing in the 50s. A woman took a shot of estrogen and immediately came down with rheumatoid arthritis, which got worse with each injection and cleared up when she stopped using it. A classmate's mother had a shot of estrogen for menopause and within 30 minutes was psychotic. The daughter began using contraceptives shortly after that and died of a stroke. Other young women using those first very high-estrogen contraceptives were being disabled by hemorrhaging.

By the time I decided to go to graduate school in biology, my intention was to study brain biology. However, the real science was being done in the endocrinology department. I had moved from Mexico to Oregon, and I started noticing my own health changing with the dark, rainy winters. I heard stories from girls who would get a cheap basement apartment and spend all winter with PMS. I was seeing the interactions of the environment with hormones.

I ran across Hans Selye's early work. In the 40s, he had characterized the functions of steroid hormones. He demonstrated that a large dose of estrogen created a shock condition. Progesterone imitated all the features of the stress-protecting hormones, so animals didn't need their adrenal glands if they had a steady supply of progesterone.

My thesis advisor had demonstrated that estrogen causes miscarriage—basically infertility—but if you give the right dose at any stage of pregnancy, it will cause abortion. He demonstrated that Vitamin E would delay age-related infertility. My project was studying the oxidative changes in the uterus during aging. I found that the changes in the uterus with aging were the same as those produced by estrogen treatment, a deficiency of Vitamin E, and radiation treatment.

I started seeing how relevant Hans Selye's work was, showing the stress-shock imitating effect of estrogen. In fact, any kind of shock or stress has estrogenic effects. You can make an animal go into estrus by irradiating any part of the body; something is produced that has an estrogenic effect. If you put a plastic bag over a rat's head, it goes into estrus. Suffocation activates the so-called estrogen receptors and will actually increase the production of estrogen.

## Estrogen: Male vs. Female Hormones

**Josh Rubin:** Because of synthetic estrogens and our environment, people have the misconception that estrogen is essentially bad. But men and women both have it, correct? We actually need it to survive; it's only a problem when it becomes excessive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is really the essential masculinizing hormone. Females can have it at the crucial developmental stage, but they have a lot of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein that inactivates estrogen. At that stage, estrogen will create a male functioning organism, while it won't affect the healthy female fetus because she is protected by that special protein. Its basic early function is as a masculine hormone.

The estrogen industry is really where the idea came from that it's a female hormone. It was identified in the ovary, but the main ovarian hormone, which is the feminizing hormone, is progesterone. Men have quite a bit of progesterone, but women live longer than men probably because they are able to produce much more progesterone.

**Josh Rubin:** That is super important. There is no such thing as a strictly male or female hormone because we both have them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen is an excitatory transmitter. Its main effects in females are to cause the pituitary to produce prolactin, to cause the breasts to develop, and to cause the uterus to expand in preparation for pregnancy. There is a great surge of estrogen right around the time of ovulation that lasts for about 12 hours; that releases histamine in many tissues and activates a great surge of cell division.

Pregnancy requires that only in the sense that the uterus is activated and made sensitive to the contact of the fertilized ovum. However, you can substitute many other irritants. You can cause implantation to happen just with histamine in the absence of estrogen. So, estrogen isn't really essential for reproduction by the female in that sense.

## Hormone Testing: Blood vs. Saliva

**Josh Rubin:** There are so many ways to get tested now. People say blood is inaccurate because estrogen and progesterone are bound to proteins like albumin, but in saliva, they aren't. What is your philosophy on which is more accurate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the problems with lab tests is that each lab tends to have its own standard, and they usually use people who are sick to establish the "normal" for a given blood test.

Regarding protein-bound versus free hormones: if you try to dissolve progesterone in water, it is very hard to dissolve. It binds nicely to albumin. The assumption is that what you measure in saliva is "free," but since they aren't soluble in water, what is it bound to when you're measuring it?

The tests done in the lab for "free" hormones are done by dialysis. "Freedom" is purely a metaphysical idea. Everything is moving along on the microscopic level in a solid phase. Several people have attached the hormone covalently to albumin so that it can't get loose, and they find that it works—it goes right into the cell. Albumin has no trouble getting into the cytoplasm or nucleus, taking its hormone with it. The idea that a hormone has to be free from a protein to get into the cell derives from the idea that there is a barrier at the surface of the cell.

There is a very good base of information for blood tests. People vary tremendously in the amount of saliva they produce and its chemical composition. When you look at the functional outcomes of manipulating steroids in fertility clinics, they see that the results in humans are almost exactly the same as established in animals: fertility requires 50 to 100 times as much progesterone as estrogen.

## Infertility, Liver Function, and PUFA

**Jeannie Rubin:** Speaking about infertility and miscarriages, how do we become estrogen dominant or progesterone deficient? What are the environmental components contributing to this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything stressful in the environment tends to increase estrogen. This research goes back to about 1940. The Biskinds [Morton and Gerson Biskind] showed that malnutrition and other stresses would increase estrogen. Malnutrition caused the liver to be unable to destroy estrogen. Normally, 100% of the estrogen that gets to the liver is prepared for excretion. If the liver is underactive because of a protein, B-vitamin, or thyroid deficiency, 100% of the estrogen reaching the liver can pass right through it back into the bloodstream.

That recirculating estrogen then turns on the adrenal stress hormones directly and blocks the thyroid gland. Thyroid was recognized in the 1940s as the basic fertility drug. Thyroid is needed to turn cholesterol into progesterone to maintain a healthy pregnancy.

Increasingly, one of the environmental factors that impairs liver function, increases estrogen activity, and inhibits thyroid function is the polyunsaturated oils—the so-called "essential fatty acids" (PUFA). These are all anti-thyroid, pro-estrogen, and anti-progesterone.

Some French researchers tried to demonstrate that fetuses are smarter when the mother gets a fish oil supplement. They found that the women getting the fish oil supplement had fetuses with retarded learning reactions. When the babies were born, they were smaller, and their brains were smaller. Animal research had predicted this: polyunsaturated fatty acids retard the development of the fetus's brain by increasing estrogen and lowering thyroid.

**Josh Rubin:** So foods high in unsaturated fats or fish oils can mimic the stress reaction.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The intestine is also a very important factor. The liver excretes part of the estrogen into the bile. If the bowel is sluggish—which happens in hypothyroidism—that estrogen tends to be reabsorbed. Sometimes just an antibiotic will drastically lower your estrogen and stress hormones by limiting that reabsorption. That is what got me interested in the raw carrot effect. You see lower estrogen and cortisol, and higher progesterone, within about three days of eating a raw carrot every day.

**Josh Rubin:** You use the raw carrot almost like charcoal to help prevent toxicity in the liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. As well as absorbing the estrogen, it reduces the absorption of endotoxin and serotonin.

## Prolactin, Serotonin, and Osteoporosis

**Josh Rubin:** Let's talk about prolactin and its correlation with osteoporosis, cortisol, and histamine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Many people have been taught that mast cells are the only cells that produce histamine, but any cell seems to be able to produce it. There is a network in the brain that specializes in histamine signaling, and it seems to be a stress-organizing influence. Serotonin is the other general stress signaling system. When anything goes wrong, your brain activates the histamine and serotonin systems.

Prolactin is one of the stress-reacting hormones. It tends to increase steadily with aging. The normal range for prolactin was lowered about 30 years ago because they saw that the top number was increased by women using birth control pills. There was an epidemic of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors resulting from contraceptive estrogen exposure. Just a few years ago, the top number was raised again in some labs because the average person is now in a stressed, hyperprolactinemic condition. Don't feel reassured if your prolactin is "normal" by today's standards; everything is under stress when it's that high.

It has been known for many years that prolactin is a major factor in bone loss. Estrogen increases prolactin, yet people are told that estrogen prevents osteoporosis. Men also develop osteoporosis progressively with age as estrogen creeps up, pushing prolactin up. When progesterone falls at menopause, that is when bone loss really picks up.

**Josh Rubin:** A lot of people don't know that estrogen and progesterone play a part in osteoclast and osteoblast production.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In 1970, Constance Martin pointed out in her textbook that there was no evidence estrogen increased bone calcium retention. The animal research was the basis for selling estrogen to prevent bone loss, but they used rats. It turns out that cortisol also increases bone density in rats, but their endocrine systems are very different from humans. Estrogen reduces osteoclast activity, so they argued it stops bone turnover. However, in the Beagle dog model, estrogen caused bone loss.

## Symptoms of Estrogen Dominance

**Josh Rubin:** What are some of the symptoms people might see if they are estrogen dominant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Since it is excitatory, it can temporarily increase alertness. It acts on the same enzymes that cocaine acts on to increase adrenaline action in the brain. It increases verbal activity. However, carried on for a long time, it is excitotoxic to the nerves.

Acute effects in the brain can include chorea—uncontrolled movements—and epilepsy. Water retention is the first action of estrogen on the cell. The excitation moves the cell's requirements to a level that can't be sustained, so oxygen becomes deficient, and the cell takes up water. This makes the blood vessels leaky.

The adrenal cortex tries to compensate for that leakiness by increasing sodium retention. You can shift from low blood pressure and swollen feet to high blood pressure. At an extreme, you can get gangrene and calcification of soft tissues. Hans Selye called this "calciphylaxis," where excited blood vessels constrict and load up on calcium. I've seen people recover from scleroderma in just a couple of weeks when they stopped using an estrogen supplement.

## Progesterone as an Anti-Estrogen

**Jeannie Rubin:** In a stress reaction, the body bypasses progesterone production to produce cortisol. How do they work together?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Stress activates the estrogen receptor. Once estrogen is acting, that turns on the cell's production of the progesterone receptor. When progesterone binds to that receptor, it destroys the estrogen receptor. Progesterone is an anti-estrogen in a very absolute sense. It knocks out the protein that keeps estrogen in the cell and activates enzymes that eliminate estrogen.

If your body has thyroid, Vitamin A, and cholesterol, it will make a massive amount of progesterone in response to estrogen stimulation to neutralize it. Progesterone also prevents the toxic effects of excess aldosterone and cortisol.

**Josh Rubin:** What is progesterone's role with magnesium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Jerry Aikawa, a magnesium specialist, showed that the cell needs magnesium to stabilize ATP. If magnesium is deficient, you are energy deficient, and that contributes to cell swelling. Thyroid (T3) is needed by the cell to retain magnesium. The production of ATP and carbon dioxide is the mechanism by which thyroid regulates the retention of magnesium. This antagonizes the improper actions of calcium. When the cell is inflamed or de-energized, it takes up calcium.

## Nutrition: Thyroid, Sugar, and Fats

**Josh Rubin:** How can one produce progesterone without medications using nutrition?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main thing interfering with thyroid function is polyunsaturated fats. You can block that very quickly with coconut oil because of the short and medium-chain saturated fats. They compete against the polyunsaturated fats for producing oxygen in the mitochondria.

Sugar does the same thing. When you have enough sugar and saturated fatty acids to interrupt the anti-metabolic effect of the polyunsaturated fats, your blood sugar is stable. The liver senses the availability of fuel (glucose) to govern your thyroid function. The liver will allow thyroxine (T4) to be turned into the active T3. As soon as your liver runs out of glucose, your T3 production falls immediately by about 60 or 70%.

**Josh Rubin:** I want to clarify regarding "high carbohydrate." You are talking about tropical fruits, root vegetables, milk, and sugar—not Pop-Tarts and grains.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Correct. I am strongly against the grainy starches. If you have to eat starch, it should be cooked for a minimum of 40 minutes and eaten with fat (cream, butter, coconut oil). Starch grains can enter the bloodstream and cause systemic injury. Sugar helps to regulate adrenaline and thyroid hormones.

I think a person should have at least 80 to 100 grams of good protein every day, but it is important not to eat too much protein by itself. Egg protein, for example, stimulates insulin secretion, which lowers blood sugar and calls for a cortisol reaction. You want protein to be used as protein, not burned for energy, so have it with sugar and fat.

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and Hot Flashes

**Jeannie Rubin:** What about women put on HRT for menopause or young women on the pill?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Consumption of menopausal hormones decreased after the 2002 Women's Health Initiative showed that estrogen causes strokes, heart attacks, dementia, and cancer. The short-term benefit is that it peps you up, like cocaine.

Hot flashes are a complex set of reactions involving stress, adrenaline, and cortisol. I noticed young women working very hard in high altitudes suffering hot flashes in their 20s. The simplest way to respond is to keep blood sugar steady. Having carbohydrate at bedtime will normally stop night sweats. A snack of orange juice and milk or salty food during the day will usually stop them.

**Josh Rubin:** Do you recommend taking progesterone supplements?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't believe in hormone replacement therapy generally. I advocate diet and thyroid first. If your cholesterol is okay, you're eating right, and your thyroid is working, you don't need progesterone.

However, for an emergency, I do recommend it for epilepsy, MS, dementia, arthritis, and acute migraines. For brain trauma patients, if you get progesterone to them in the first day, they practically all recover.

## The Warburg Effect and Cancer

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You sent a question about Warburg's theory of cancer. People are misinterpreting him, thinking you should go on a sugar-free diet. Warburg said the respiratory apparatus (mitochondria) is impaired. The cancer goes on burning the body's protein and fat stores. If you give it sugar, you can slow down the destruction of the body.

Warburg emphasized that sugar is being converted to lactic acid. Lactic acid turns on stress reactions. The "sugar-free diet" people blame on Warburg doesn't fit what he said.

**Josh Rubin:** So it's the body's incorrect use of sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The instantaneous effect of either estrogen or unsaturated fatty acids is to imitate the Warburg effect—lacking the Pasteur effect, which is for oxygen to turn off lactic acid production. In the presence of high estrogen and PUFA, we make lactic acid and cannot use the energy oxidatively.

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, we really appreciate you coming on and sharing your knowledge.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
