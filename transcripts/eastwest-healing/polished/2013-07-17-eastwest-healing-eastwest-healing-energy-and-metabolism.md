## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome everyone to our new episode of Holistic Living. Today we are talking about energy metabolism. We have Dr. Raymond Peat back on the show. For those of you who don't know who he is, Ray got his PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. He has taught in many schools, from the University of Oregon to Montana State University and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine. He also does private nutritional counseling. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968. Ray, is there anything you want to add about what you are currently working on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At the moment, I've been working on some of the similarities of the different organs. Recent newsletters were on the heart and the typical solid tumor as an organ, having some of the properties of other organs during stress. Currently, I'm working on the organization of the eye and the brain as they express some of those same properties of the failing heart and tumor physiology. You see some of the same processes showing up in such different places. I am trying to generalize things so that various treatments, diets, and programs don't seem arbitrary, but so you can see what is in common.

## Energy Metabolism and the Randall Cycle

**Josh Rubin:** Let's move on to the show. Today we're going to be talking about energy metabolism. A lot of people talk about macronutrients; some say high protein is good, or high fat, or high carb. I think we all agree that all macronutrients are important, though we have different views on the ratios. Can you talk about the cells and metabolism and why it's so important when we talk about energy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the themes I've been interested in for a long time is the function of carbon dioxide in cells. In some observations, people have seen that the most improbable organism is unable to live without carbon dioxide, even though they can live without oxygen. Ordinarily, we think of oxygen turning into carbon dioxide as a waste product, but it really seems to be even more essential for life than oxygen.

Carbohydrates are a very good source of carbon dioxide. They oxidize and produce a lot of carbon dioxide. If carbon dioxide is that essential to life, then obviously the best food to produce it is going to be carbohydrates.

In recent newsletters, I've been pointing out some of the things that are becoming fairly common knowledge now regarding the failing heart. If you look at what happens when you exercise: when you're sitting at rest, the quiet muscle burns almost pure sugar and oxygen—pure glucose and oxygen. But as soon as it starts exercising, it shifts over to fat oxidation. At maximum exercise, it's burning mostly fat and very little oxygen. It produces quite a bit of lactic acid because it's wasting sugar. It's burning the fat pretty thoroughly, but it's wasting the sugar and turning it into lactic acid.

The failing heart does the same thing. It's exerting its maximum, and in doing that, it's burning fatty acids primarily rather than sugar. This process of substituting fat burning for sugar burning was called a cycle by P.J. Randle. It isn't really a cycle, but now it's called the Randall Cycle. This means that if you burn fatty acids, that stops you from oxidizing glucose; instead, you'll turn it into lactic acid.

Diabetes consists of living on fatty acids and not being able to oxidize glucose, but still turning glucose into lactic acid, so that lactic acidemia becomes a problem in diabetes. Obviously, to make lactic acid out of glucose, it has to get into the cells. So this whole idea that transporting glucose into the cell is the failure in heart disease or diabetes just isn't the case. If you're making lactic acid, the sugar is getting into the cell. Something goes wrong in the oxidation process and the cell begins to favor the oxidation of fat rather than glucose. That doesn't produce as much carbon dioxide, and that seems to be a basic problem for the cell that leads it down the path of reduced function and eventual non-survival.

A very similar thing happens in cancer cells. They begin turning glucose into lactic acid or fat, and then they oxidize the fat. In treating heart disease over the last five years, there's been a movement towards thinking of ways to stop the oxidation of fatty acids, allowing the heart to avoid the Randall Cycle and get back to oxidizing glucose instead of turning it into lactic acid.

## Carbohydrates vs. Fats

**Josh Rubin:** When you say carbohydrates are the most important because they increase the production of energy (CO2), can you define what you mean by carbohydrates? Some people might hear that and think you're talking about eating a high-fat diet because our bodies are using fat for energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** We can turn protein into both sugar and fat equivalents. So when you're talking about energy, you have to consider that some of it might come from protein. But oxidizing protein is very wasteful. Besides being expensive, it produces a lot of waste material—ammonia, for example—and it turns on machinery which resembles the stress reaction. When we're in stress, we break down protein and turn it into energy materials.

The mechanism of oxidizing fat also gets into the process of creating stress. Especially the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) activate the same stress-responsive enzymes that burning too much protein will activate.

By carbohydrate, people generally mean both starches and sugars. It's simply anything that's made up of that same proportion of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Starches are just long chains of sugars. In the case of most food starches, they're composed of pure glucose molecules. So when you're getting energy from starch, you're really burning pure glucose. Sucrose, the standard table sugar, is also the main sugar of sweet fruits. It consists of half glucose and half fructose. Fructose happens to be able to metabolize without relying on the use of insulin. So it has been used for feeding diabetics and for avoiding some of the stresses produced by the ups and downs of the insulin reactions.

**Josh Rubin:** So getting the right amount of carbohydrates in relation to protein and fat is one way to increase glucose oxidation. If you're relying on fat, you're inhibiting glucose oxidation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, fructose and glucose, assuming you're eating a sugar such as fruits.

## Antioxidants and Vitamin E

**Josh Rubin:** You talk about how antioxidants allow oxygen to be used productively rather than destructively. We could say CO2 is an antioxidant. Are there more specific examples you could give regarding antioxidants to help with the production of CO2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Running the oxidative process through the mitochondria very fast happens to be an antioxidative process in terms of avoiding toxic free radicals. The faster you burn oxygen usefully oxidizing sugars, the less you have to worry about taking care of the free radical toxic products that develop when you slow down the respiratory process by burning fats, especially polyunsaturated fats.

Vitamin E, vitamin C, and uric acid (which is produced in our body) are major antioxidants. But the marketing of the idea of antioxidants has created a big confusion. The antioxidants in our body have to fit together with uric acid and the enzymes which naturally break down free radicals. If you put things in that don't fit, an apparent antioxidant in a test tube can become a pro-oxidant in the body.

Things have to fit together so that vitamin A and vitamin E lock together, vitamin E and vitamin C lock together, and uric acid and vitamin C lock together. The glucose and other sugars have to be streaming through the systems of enzymes, turning into carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide has to be flowing out of the cell properly. The whole antioxidant system is really one piece. If you try to stuff in any "super antioxidants" like they're selling as health products, you're likely to create more oxidation than you had without it. A recent publication showed that cataracts are twice as common in men over the age of 65 who took big supplements of vitamin E and vitamin C.

**Josh Rubin:** When you talk about progesterone, vitamin E, and vitamin C, are you talking more from a food sense or a supplemental sense?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Vitamin E has a peculiar history. It started out in the 1930s being called a fertility nutrient. The Shute family of doctors studied it in treating women with clotting problems and fertility problems. They saw that it prevented abnormal clotting, which is a feature of excess estrogen. Estrogen has many problem side effects when it's excessive and unopposed. The Shutes and others in the 1930s saw that vitamin E restored fertility and prevented heart disease by functioning as an anti-estrogen.

Around that same time, the polyunsaturated fats were being seen to have estrogen-like effects and to cause clotting and circulatory problems. Animals that were fed on a high polyunsaturated fat diet were sterile. Various forces, such as the estrogen industry, didn't want estrogen associated with sterility and heart disease. Various pressures turned vitamin E into an "antioxidant" rather than an anti-estrogenic material. By 1950, the whole history of vitamin E had been turned into an antioxidant.

I don't see it as primarily an antioxidant. I see it as anti-inflammatory and anti-estrogenic, with this potential side effect of protecting against free radicals if it's in the right concentration and balance with other chemicals.

**Josh Rubin:** Because estrogen creates that hypoxic environment at the cell level, and vitamin E does the opposite, you're saying it allows oxygen to be used more efficiently. In a sense, because of that, it's anti-estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Both estrogen and anything that creates inflammation wastes oxygen and tends to lead to lactic acid production. Vitamin E, by stopping the inflammation and estrogen effects, is also making more oxygen available and reducing the lactic acid problem.

## Estrogen and Thyroid Function

**Josh Rubin:** Can you talk about free fatty acids? How they can cause a sluggish liver, inhibit T4 to T3 conversion, and lead to edema?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is the hormone that activates our whole oxidative system and leads to the production of carbon dioxide when it's working properly. Estrogen, besides working at the cell level to waste oxygen, happens to block the enzymes that secrete thyroid hormone.

The fatty acids that are saturated happen to oxidize with fair safety. The polyunsaturated fatty acids are the ones that are more likely to break down and produce free radicals. Cells distinguish between these two types of fatty acids and prefer to oxidize the saturated fats. That means that anytime you eat a little bit of excess unsaturated fat, it primarily goes into storage because the cells prefer not to oxidize it.

However, estrogen prefers those oxygen-wasting, free-radical-producing fats. It preferentially causes them to be liberated from storage. So under the influence of estrogen, all of the free fatty acids increase. Women have, on average, a higher level of free fatty acids circulating. Estrogen preferentially brings the polyunsaturated fats out of storage, especially the very long-chain polyunsaturated ones. These are the ones that most interfere with other levels of thyroid function—not just the secretion, which estrogen directly does, but with the transport and metabolism of the thyroid hormone. So at many levels, estrogen and the polyunsaturated fats are working together to inhibit the function of the thyroid hormone and the oxidative system.

**Josh Rubin:** Does that also have to do with estrogen stimulating the adrenal cortex, putting yourself into that sympathetic state which causes the breakdown of proteins and increases free fatty acids?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Estrogen directly stimulates the secretion of insulin, and that tends to lower blood sugar and create fat storage if you've eaten more than enough. But it also directly stimulates the adrenal cortex, increasing aldosterone and cortisol, and that causes the whole system to go into the emergency reaction process. The cortisol tends to bring blood sugar up where the insulin tends to lower it. So the more estrogen is increased and unopposed by protective things such as progesterone, DHEA, pregnenolone, and thyroid, the more system stresses and tendency to failure there are.

## Endometriosis and Inflammation

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding endometriosis and body temperature, you've talked about the work of Desjardins and how estrogen's interactions with unsaturated fats cause damage to brain cells. Is that a major factor in endometriosis?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Desjardins and his group were interested in many of the side effects of estrogen on the brain, pituitary, endorphins, iron accumulation, and fatty acids. Because of the estrogen-thyroid effects and the constant pushing up of growth hormone from the pituitary, the liver is feminized from an early age. This shows up in studies of liver transplants. They found that because of this process of stress hormones and growth hormone feminizing women's livers, they make poor candidates relative to the livers of men for transplant.

**Josh Rubin:** So you're saying endometriosis is more of the inability to detoxify this excess estrogen versus a low progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It involves the liver and the pituitary, but estrogen is very central to the actual lesion or abnormal tissue of endometriosis. Simply by reducing estrogen exposure, you can alleviate the symptoms.

The cells begin producing estrogen; they express the enzyme aromatase, which manufactures estrogen. They used to think aromatase existed only in the ovary, but it turned out to exist in fat cells, breast cells, skin cells, bone, and muscle. Everywhere that is under stress will begin to produce estrogen molecules.

In endometrial tissue, it should be exposed to estrogen for only about 12 hours each month. Then progesterone should surge up to 50 or 100 times higher concentration and cause the cells to give up their production of estrogen. But instead, the aromatase keeps churning out estrogen. The estrogen excites the tissue and turns on the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which turns polyunsaturated fatty acids into prostaglandins, creating inflammation that causes the pain and contractions. The inflammation from the prostaglandin in turn creates more aromatase. So it gets a vicious cycle going.

The simplest, most physiological way to stop it is to eat a diet with adequate protein, sugar, trace minerals, and vitamins, and to make sure your thyroid is functioning. I've seen people who had been suffering painful endometriosis for years who, in two or three days, completely stopped the symptoms permanently just with quick-acting thyroid, a good diet, and aspirin. Aspirin or other blockers of prostaglandin production all by themselves can greatly reduce the formation of estrogen and break the cycle.

**Josh Rubin:** So eliminating unsaturated fats will help reduce estrogen production?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, they are central to endometriosis.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you elaborate on aspirin therapy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In cancers, the cells that are stressed begin to produce estrogen. As long as there is polyunsaturated fat available, the estrogen is going to activate the cyclooxygenase enzyme that makes prostaglandins, which keep the aromatase active, producing more estrogen. Even if you aren't eating it currently, the polyunsaturated fat that was incorporated into your tissues is going to break down under stress, flow into the bloodstream, and feed the production of estrogen.

Sugar is one of the things that can reduce the flow of polyunsaturated fats out of your tissues into your bloodstream. Niacinamide is another thing that limits the release of these fatty acids. So both sugar and niacinamide back up the function of aspirin.

**Josh Rubin:** So for endometriosis: get the right amount of carbs, regulate thyroid, use niacinamide, and possibly aspirin therapy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Josh Rubin:** How does estrogen relate to body temperature and pulse?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even though estrogen turns on the stress hormones, and the stress hormones tend to protect the body temperature, at a certain point of estrogen dominance, even the adrenaline and cortisol aren't enough to keep your body warm. So your temperature falls after a certain total exposure to unopposed estrogen.

Progesterone, all by itself, can drastically and quickly increase your temperature while at the same time lowering the stress hormones. Progesterone blocks the estrogen's effect, simply letting you return to a more normal set point. In doing that, it stops mechanisms that cause flushing, such as nitric oxide, which causes vasodilation and heat loss.

## Caller: PUFA and Hibernation

**Caller (David):** I remember reading about Lewis and Clark being offered salmon by Northwestern Indians and being repulsed by it because they were used to ruminants. How did these tribes survive or thrive on salmon? Have they learned to balance it? Also, animals like bears gorge on salmon and then hibernate. Is it possible animals stumble into this polyunsaturated fat thing and realize it puts them into a state where they can just sleep through the winter?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Northwest Indians had a lot of varied foods. I don't know how much salmon they ate year-round, but they dried quite a bit of it. Mixtures of bear fat, berries, and fruits were able to survive storage. Those were usual staples.

**Caller (David):** Bear fat would be pretty saturated, wouldn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because bears like to eat a lot of fruit and grass; they aren't primarily carnivores.

**Caller (David):** I know squirrels and other rodents eat nuts. Has that been studied regarding metabolism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Squirrels have been studied pretty well. They found that when they kept them from eating the acorn-type, highly unsaturated things in the fall, they didn't hibernate. The PUFA increased the serotonin and put them to sleep. It wasn't even good sleep; typically they'll wake up a few times during the winter to sleep normally. It's a type of torpor.

**Caller (David):** So it appears we try to make the best of whatever situation we are in.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think that is gradual adaptation to seasonal stress. People get depressed in the winter, but they aren't able to spend four or five months sleeping it off.

## Hot Flashes and Blood Sugar

**Josh Rubin:** What are your thoughts on hot flashes? We know the mechanism behind them, but why do some women get estrogen therapy and it actually eliminates their hot flashes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I have a little bit about that in my last newsletter. I think it just creates a stress that keeps them from experiencing the ups and downs.

**Josh Rubin:** So it's almost like taking that excess estrogen pushes them over the edge and shuts things down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it slows the metabolism enough that they aren't going in and out of the state.

**Josh Rubin:** Regarding mothers and babies with colic or eczema, doctors often suggest food intolerances. What are your thoughts on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In animal experiments, some people saw that the mildest allergen would produce a deadly allergic reaction if they lowered the blood sugar. The mother's system can pass allergens through the milk. But with these animal studies, they found that if they increased the blood sugar artificially, the deadliest allergens that had killed normal animals would just cause a little sniffling. Lowering the blood sugar from whatever cause would cause a mild allergen to kill the animal in shock.

I've seen many times in people who used to rush to the hospital for a shot or who carried an adrenaline pen for an allergic exposure, instead, they would keep a big bottle of Coke in the fridge, drink the Coke quickly as soon as they had the exposure, and stop going to the hospital.

**Josh Rubin:** So postpartum, it's more of a hypoglycemic reaction? If someone was able to regulate their blood sugar and increase thyroid production, doing that alone would heal them and the baby?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Even when a woman has had a very happy pregnancy, because the pregnancy itself is driving her hormones, as soon as she has the baby, there's a letdown in which she discovers her own hypothyroid, progesterone-deficient state. This becomes excessively estrogen-dominated. That causes the postpartum depression syndrome along with a whole range of other possible consequences such as rheumatoid arthritis, MS, allergies, and seizures.

## Caller: Thyroid Labs and PUFA Detox

**Caller (Carmen):** I've been on the Ray Peat plan with orange juice and food for about 23 days. Within three days, I was able to stop taking my thyroid medicine. My temperatures went up to 98.1–99.2 and have stayed up. My pulse is about 65 in the morning and goes up to 85 during the day. Is that okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think 85 is a very good daytime pulse rate. You should stay alert to possible fluctuations in your stress hormones, but those numbers sound very good.

**Caller (Carmen):** I had my labs pulled yesterday. What can I expect with my labs, or does it matter as long as I feel good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You want to keep your eye on TSH if you have the opportunity. You don't want it to go too high because it will start creating the symptoms of hypothyroidism, inflammation, and heart rhythm issues. It's safest to keep your TSH down.

**Caller (Carmen):** How high is too high? The highest mine was was 3.0.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would say that three is always too high. Below one is where I feel more comfortable. In a big population, the freedom from thyroid cancer is best when the TSH is below 0.4.

**Caller (Carmen):** How do you actually get rid of the stored PUFA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That really is a problem. It's worse than storing DDT, I think. We do have the ability; the liver can treat them like a poison and excrete them so they pass out through the urine without having to be oxidized. But if the liver isn't very well supported, the polyunsaturated fats can block those enzymes in the liver the way estrogen does. So you have to make sure that your liver isn't under stress. Don't go too long without eating.

## Monitoring Metabolism

**Josh Rubin:** What do body temperature and pulse tell us about energy metabolism? Do you find that to be more accurate than a thyroid panel?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As long as you do it in the same way, in the same place, it doesn't matter very much. The mouth is quicker than the armpit usually. I found that some people had fat armpits and it would take about two hours to get the temperature up through that thick layer of fat.

Also, in hot, humid weather, I saw hypothyroid people with normal temperatures. So I checked their pulse. These people coming in with 98.6 temperatures had 45-minute pulse rates. You have to look at more than one indicator.

The Achilles reflex relaxation test is a very quick and definite indicator of thyroid function. You want the toe to hang freely and relaxed when you kneel in a chair. If you thump it and get a twitch, the foot should relax with complete, instantaneous relaxation. It should look just like a piece of jelly flopping there after the outward twitch. If your thyroid is good, the relaxation should be utterly relaxed and floppy.

**Josh Rubin:** With temperature and pulse, we're looking at how our cells are using glucose, oxygen, and thyroid. It shows you that you're going in the right direction, correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you add a supplement of pregnenolone and thyroid to a good diet, you can get there pretty quickly. To get there just with diet depends on how much PUFA you have stored in your tissues. A big fat person has a lot of work to get rid of some of the toxic stuff. A very skinny person can sometimes pop out of a chronic state of stress in as little as a week.

**Josh Rubin:** Ray, we really appreciate it. We learned a ton from your research. Thank you for your time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You're welcome. Thank you.
