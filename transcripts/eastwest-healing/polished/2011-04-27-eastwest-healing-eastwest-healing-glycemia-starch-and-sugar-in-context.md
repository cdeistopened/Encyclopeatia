## Introduction

**Josh Rubin:** Welcome again for a great show. We're going to have Ray Peat on once again. For those who don't know who we are, we own a wellness company in the San Diego area, East West Healing and Performance. We work with people that have GI problems, hormone problems, and physical problems from all over the world.

Today's show is about sugar. Ray Peat is going to be talking about sugar, dispelling some of the myths, and explaining why we need it and the different types. For those of you that don't know Ray, you can visit his website at raypeat.com. Ray has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon and specializes in physiology. He started his work regarding hormones, such as progesterone, back in the 1960s.

One thing I wanted to bring up: Ray is a very humble guy. He keeps answering your emails, which is why he is so busy. All we ask is that if you keep emailing him and he keeps sending you emails back, please send him some money. It doesn't matter if it's a dollar or $500. This great information can't get out unless he can do the research.

Let me get Ray and Jeannie on. Ray, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Jeannie Rubin:** We just want to make sure that people are respectful of your time and energy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm sending fewer, very long answers now that more people are writing. I'm trying to condense my answers.

**Josh Rubin:** We definitely appreciate it. Let's talk about sugar, starches, and glycemia. This is probably the one topic people are most interested in because there is so much conflicting information out there. You have so many people saying, "Don't eat sugar. It causes diabetes, insulin resistance, cancer, and AGEs." Then we look at your research, and it's completely different. What got you started focusing on starch, sugar, and glycemia?

## Sugar, Stress, and Migraines

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the things was reading John Yudkin's book. He was the English researcher who wrote a book saying that sugar causes heart disease. He showed that sugar increases cholesterol. That was back when everyone was saying cholesterol causes heart disease. I was very impressed by his research, but since I saw cholesterol as a protective factor from studying progesterone, I interpreted it differently. I saw that if you were deficient in progesterone or under stress, your body would increase the production of cholesterol to make more progesterone to protect your systems.

I believed Yudkin was on the right track, but since I saw cholesterol as protective rather than harmful, I took his evidence to mean that sugar would help resist stress.

That started me along that line. I had been a migraineur all my life. I gradually came to see that a change in my rhythm of eating in relation to activity was usually what brought on a migraine attack. Often, I would have very odd food cravings just before the migraine appeared. I started trusting those cravings. I found that if I ate enough sweet stuff—like a quart of ice cream—when I felt a migraine coming on, it wouldn't happen.

I was also a problem sleeper. If I stayed up an hour or two after my normal bedtime, my sleep would be disturbed. One night I was talking on the radio and wanted to keep going. I had a friend buy me huge milkshakes, about one an hour. I was able to keep talking until 1:00 AM and didn't have any problem going to sleep. I recognized that I had a peculiar need for sugar when I was doing anything unusually stressful. That started me thinking more about the physiology of it.

## Protein, Insulin, and Cortisol

**Josh Rubin:** Most people out there, like the Paleo community, advocate high protein and low carb. Physiologically, what is the importance of getting sugars into our body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At one time, I was experimenting with chocolate as a source of magnesium. I found that bitter chocolate was extremely high in magnesium. However, chocolate happens to be very high in leucine, and it would give me low blood sugar. I would crave something to eat shortly after eating a lump of black chocolate. That started me thinking about amino acids in relation to blood sugar.

Several amino acids in proteins are powerful insulin stimulants. When you eat protein by itself, you stimulate insulin secretion, which is needed to metabolize the amino acids. But in reaction to the insulin, your liver has to put out glucose to keep your blood sugar going so your brain and tissues can keep working.

If your liver is low on glycogen, every time you eat protein and have an insulin secretion, your body secretes a compensating amount of cortisol to bring your blood sugar back up. The cortisol brings your blood sugar up at the expense of protein. The first tissues that cortisol breaks down are your thymus gland, immune cells, and muscles.

If you eat lots of protein in spite of the high cortisol, you can maintain your muscle mass, but you are running on a constantly high cortisol secretion. In my previous interest in diabetes, I saw that doctors neglected to measure hormones related to blood sugar when prescribing insulin. When we tested cortisol in some of these "diabetics," we saw that many just had very high cortisol. Sugar happens to be the best thing for lowering cortisol to normal. Since high cortisol gives the impression of diabetes by causing high blood sugar, you get the unexpected effect that eating sugar lowers the cortisol, and some of these people had a very quick recovery from their so-called diabetes.

## Adrenal Exhaustion vs. Adaptation

**Josh Rubin:** There is so much out there on adrenal fatigue. My perception is that people took Hans Selye's work and misperceived his General Adaptation Syndrome. You talk about using sugar to lower cortisol. What about people that have low cortisol? Is that possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In Selye's studies, he never talked about adrenal fatigue; "exhaustion" was his word. When you stress an animal terribly, it enters the shock phase, then the adaptation phase, and finally the exhaustion phase where the animal would die from stress.

He found that pregnant animals didn't need their adrenal glands. As soon as they would have a litter, the next stress would kill them because their progesterone was no longer being produced to compensate for the adrenal absence. He gave some animals a daily dose of progesterone after taking out their adrenal glands and found that they would live a full, normal, healthy life.

The adrenals are there to regulate your sugar and salt. It happens that progesterone regulates sugar and salt metabolism just as nicely. To produce these hormones, you need various nutrients, but especially thyroid hormone and Vitamin A to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone. If a person is deficient in Vitamin A or thyroid, their cholesterol tends to rise, trying to compensate.

So, with a thyroid or nutritional deficiency, you can be deficient in steroid hormones, but it isn't the fault of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are extremely adaptive. You can basically destroy the adrenals, and if you have a few cells left—and good nutrition and thyroid function—the adrenal cortex will regenerate very well.

## Fructose and Blood Sugar Regulation

**Josh Rubin:** Because cortisol is a glucocorticoid, it regulates blood sugar. Are we eating foods that block sugar from getting into the cell?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's where fructose and sucrose come in. Fructose is the most powerful sugar at regulating blood sugar, both up and down. It has been used in diabetics for decades as a small supplement to help bring down their blood sugar. It is also effective in hypoglycemia because it helps to regulate insulin production and slowly turns into glucose.

**Josh Rubin:** Can you give some examples of where listeners would get fructose?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Health food stores used to sell pure fructose, though I don't recommend it in prepared foods because it's almost always combined with starches. Starches turn into glucose very quickly, whereas fructose is a very slow, controlled converter into glucose, so it regulates insulin.

**Josh Rubin:** In your articles, you mention that insulin itself accounts for only about 8% of the insulin-like activity in the blood, with potassium being a large factor. Can you elaborate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several things imitate the function of insulin. For example, exercise increases the cell's ability to take up glucose. Leucine acts like insulin. But potassium itself has that effect. Since fruits are one of the best sources of potassium, that makes fruit a good food.

Fruits usually have about a 50/50 balance of fructose and glucose (sucrose is half fructose, half glucose). Besides that balance, fruits contain potassium and magnesium, which help regulate glucose. When you drink orange juice, the high potassium content reduces the amount of insulin you have to secrete to handle the sugar. That accounts for why they are much more smoothly handled than a similar number of calories in the form of starch.

## Fruit Selection: Starch, Allergens, and Serotonin

**Josh Rubin:** What types of fruits do you recommend, and which ones could hurt us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost all sweet fruits are better than the alternative of bread, pasta, and cereals. However, among sweet fruits, there are factors to watch.

For example, bananas are almost all starch unless they are ripened to the point of being a translucent amber mush. High starch content stimulates insulin. Furthermore, if you don't eat starch with fat, starch grains can get into your bloodstream. Gerhard Volkheimer showed that large starch grains can clog small arterioles and cause chronic tissue injury.

Besides starch, you have the allergy problem. This is partly due to the industrialization of banana farming. The latex allergy corresponds to the banana allergy; both plants produce defensive stress substances (chitinases) to kill insects, which happen to be highly allergenic to humans. Even some apples have a high allergen content. Cooking many allergenic fruits makes them safer.

A third factor is serotonin content. Bananas excel in high serotonin content. Before people were aware of this, doctors were diagnosing intestinal tumors when they found high serotonin in the urine. Prunes, plums, and kiwis are also high in serotonin.

That leaves things like watermelons, grapes, and citrus fruits—oranges in particular—as safer options.

**Josh Rubin:** Would you put mangoes and pineapples in the allergy or serotonin category?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pineapples are known to have a fairly high amount of tryptophan that can contribute to serotonin. Mangoes are in the same family as poison oak. In the tropics, "mango sickness" is well known. It is partly because they are a fibrous fruit; if the fiber isn't handled by the right bacteria, it can cause toxin production in the intestine. Any carbohydrate that isn't sugar can potentially feed bacteria that produce toxins.

## Serotonin and Free Fatty Acids

**Josh Rubin:** You talk about glucose playing a factor in serotonin levels.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Serotonin is a major trigger of the stress adaptation system. It turns on the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals. The internet is full of people saying sugar raises serotonin because you "feel good" after eating it. Actually, it is free fatty acids that cause your brain to take up more tryptophan and make more serotonin. You produce more free fatty acids when your blood sugar is low and when you are under stress. So, stress, starvation, or hypoglycemia will make you produce free fatty acids, which send serotonin into your brain and trigger the cortisol stress reaction.

**Josh Rubin:** A listener asked: If they want to lose weight, isn't it important to metabolize fatty acids? You say the opposite—that liberating free fatty acids is harmful.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** At rest, muscles metabolize fatty acids. At maximal activity, you burn almost pure sugar. If your liver is well-energized with thyroid hormone and sugar, it can treat excess free fatty acids produced by stress as a toxin and excrete them.

However, on our 20th-century diet, our tissues are filled with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). When these are liberated during stress or fasting, they suppress mitochondrial metabolism by interfering with thyroid hormone. Within two or three days of fasting or low-carb dieting, a person's metabolic rate drops tremendously. They lose mostly muscle tissue because of the stress produced by low blood sugar. It is the degree of free fatty acids being mobilized that suppresses your ability to burn calories.

## Orange Juice Pulp and Fiber

**Josh Rubin:** Why do you recommend orange juice with no pulp?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any pulp is potential food for bacteria. Experiments with rats showed that fermentable fiber increased toxin formation in the intestines. Animals became anxious and aggressive with fiber; without it, they were friendly.

Regarding commercial orange juice: about 15 years ago, the EPA told the industry their waste was attracting pests. One technology they used to dispose of it was dissolving the waste with enzymes and leaving it in the juice. Much of the commercial "high pulp" juice contains fiber that has been chemically altered so it never settles out. It acts like gums or fibers that can be intestinal toxins.

## The Thymus and Aging

**Josh Rubin:** Everyone says the thymus shrinks as we age. You suggest this is due to PUFAs and stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cortisol maintains blood sugar by blocking the use of sugar for most purposes. Immune cells, which the thymus consists of, cannot use sugar in the presence of cortisol. Cortisol forces them to metabolize fats, and unsaturated fats will quickly kill the thymus. It only takes about three hours for the thymus gland to disappear during profound stress.

If a person is killed instantly at a young age, they still have a thymus. If it takes them a few hours to die, the thymus disappears. This is why they thought the thymus disappears in adulthood. Given the right nutrition and hormones, the thymus can regenerate.

## Vegetables and Roots

**Josh Rubin:** What vegetables do you recommend?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Low fiber, low starch items. Small summer squash, well-cooked with butter, is very similar to fruit. Generally, roots are safer. Leaves are the energy factory of the plant and contain defensive toxins. Roots are protected underground and have antifungal chemicals but are pretty free of the plant defensive toxins found in leaves.

Young turnips and potatoes that haven't maximized starch production, eaten with butter after being thoroughly cooked, are pretty safe.

Potatoes are almost unique. The liquid part of the potato contains ketoacids, which are the equivalent of amino acids. These can be used as fuel by the brain and heart as a substitute for sugar. They are an ideal anti-stress fuel.

I have seen cases where juicing potatoes—using a centrifugal juicer to throw out the starch—and then cooking the juice (it coagulates like scrambled eggs) provided recovery for people who were dying. It provides energy and essential amino acids without stimulating insulin or cortisol.

**Jeannie Rubin:** Would you suggest using that with a carbohydrate and fat?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** R.L. Veech is a ketone researcher whose ideas are being applied to Alzheimer's. The ketones provide energy the brain can't get from fat or sugar. Potato juice is an economical way to get these ketones. I knew a girl who couldn't digest anything and had wasted away to 65 pounds. She burped ammonia when she ate protein. I made her potato juice; she digested it perfectly, stopped burping ammonia, and recovered to 130 pounds.

## Honey, Maple Syrup, and Sucrose

**Josh Rubin:** What are your thoughts on honey and maple syrup?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Honey is almost pure sugar with some minerals. It is a good food. Maple syrup has high potassium and magnesium, but it is boiled down. Very hot, oxygen-exposed glucose can create allergens. You have to be cautious with dark, concentrated sugars like molasses or agave.

**Josh Rubin:** Let's talk about sucrose (white table sugar). People like Dr. Lustig talk about its toxicity. Why do you recommend it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For about 45 years, the mechanism of diabetes has been understood. Argentine researchers showed sugar was protective against diabetes. The "Randle Cycle" (named after Philip Randle) describes how fatty acids block the use of glucose. If you increase free fatty acids, your ability to metabolize glucose disappears.

The Randle Cycle is the instantaneous diabetogenic effect of fatty acids. Chronically, this poisons the beta cells in the pancreas. Recent studies have found that sugar stimulates the regeneration of beta cells in the pancreas.

**Josh Rubin:** Why is there so much misconception?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can produce toxic effects in animals if you give them 60% of their diet as sucrose or fructose. However, many studies exaggerate these findings or misinterpret adaptive signs as harmful.

There are studies where animals were given Coca-Cola or sucrose water in addition to their chow. These animals were able to eat 50% more food than the control group without getting fat. This shows a tremendous increase in metabolic rate. Fructose catalyzes the ability to oxidize glucose at a higher rate. It works like thyroid hormone to increase ATP production.

## Insulin Resistance and PUFA

**Josh Rubin:** So it's not the sugars themselves, but our diet high in unsaturated fats that makes sugar look bad?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. If you look at the national diet over the last 50 years, calorie consumption has increased, but mostly through starch and polyunsaturated fats. There has actually been a slight decrease in the proportion of sugars.

**Josh Rubin:** What causes insulin resistance?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the polyunsaturated fats. Sucrose, because of its fructose component, increases the ability to dispose of glucose. You can instantly demonstrate the effect of polyunsaturated fats blocking the ability to use glucose.

## Glycogen Storage and Intolerance

**Josh Rubin:** What would cause someone to be unable to store enough glycogen in the liver?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid deficiency is the most common reason. Selenium is needed to activate the thyroid, but to use selenium, you need glucose. Fructose happens to be the best stimulant for the liver to store glycogen. The current phobia is that fructose increases triglycerides. But before it does that, it powerfully helps the liver replenish glycogen stores.

**Josh Rubin:** Can people have an intolerance to fruit? Some people crash after drinking juice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people who have been low thyroid for a long time have bacteria living high up in their intestine, near the stomach. If they drink juice, the bacteria get the sugar first. Some people even get drunk because their stomach is brewing alcohol.

To work around this, you want to experiment with things that suppress bacterial growth, like the raw carrot salad. Raw carrots contain defensive antibiotics. If you eat a grated raw carrot, you suppress the bacteria and fungi that cause food reactions. Bamboo shoots are another option; they are a good source of antibiotics.

## Candida

**Josh Rubin:** What is your take on Candida? Many say to cut out sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** René Dubos, a bacteriologist, showed that if you starve yeast, they start sending out invasive filaments (pseudohyphae) into the intestine looking for sugar. That is when they can become systemic. Having sugar in your diet is actually a defensive means while you are trying to get rid of the yeast, which carrots will usually do fairly quickly.

## Sweeteners and Acne

**Josh Rubin:** Thoughts on Stevia and Xylitol?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In themselves, they are harmless. But the sweet taste activates your sugar metabolizing systems (insulin). This tends to increase appetite and can contribute to chronic stress by confusing your system—telling it sugar is coming when it isn't, which triggers cortisol.

**Josh Rubin:** We notice some people get acne when introducing sugar.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sugar activates the thyroid, which makes the skin function better (more moisture and oil). However, if you are deficient in Vitamin A, the skin becomes susceptible to infection. You need to balance the increased metabolic rate with adequate Vitamin A from eggs, liver, or milk.

## Caller Questions

### Milk and Mucus
**Caller:** I have problems with cow's milk creating mucus, but goat's milk is fine. If I stop starch, can I tolerate cow's milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If goat's milk is fine, stick with that or cheese. Starches like corn can feed bacteria that cause the reaction. Having a raw carrot regularly helps reduce the allergy effects that cause mucus. Also, try switching brands of cow's milk; sometimes the additives or what the cows ate cause the irritation.

### Melanoma and Diet
**Caller:** I have stage four melanoma. I was instructed to eat potatoes, sugar, saturated fats, and avoid gluten. I'm very weak.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Are you getting enough calcium? Parathyroid hormone tends to promote tumor growth. Eating plenty of calcium (around 1500mg/day) along with Vitamin D and K helps keep parathyroid hormone down.

**Caller:** I was told not to take calcium. I'm taking Vitamin D. What about fish oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Seeds, nuts, and fish oils are a problem because of the unsaturated fats. I've heard of people using aspirin (up to 4 grams a day) to lower immune factors that promote inflammation and tumor growth. Increasing thyroid to the point of being hyper-metabolic can make visible tumors dry up. I use Cytomel (T3) for this.

### Sleep Issues
**Caller:** I have delayed sleep phase syndrome. I can't fall asleep until 6:00 AM.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Sometimes a very small dose of thyroid helps. One doctor who had been awake for days took 10 micrograms of Cytomel and slept. Sugar is the next best thing. A glass of warm milk with 2 or 3 tablespoons of sugar dissolved in it will usually have an effect similar to thyroid.

**Caller:** How do you dose T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The body produces about 4 micrograms per hour. It's good to supplement in small amounts, like 2 micrograms per hour, or take 10 micrograms with lunch so it spreads out as you digest.

## Conclusion

**Josh Rubin:** We covered a lot today. This philosophy isn't cookie-cutter. It's about fine-tuning based on your metabolic demands. Don't just jump on the internet and buy T3; if your nutrition isn't in order, you can cause more harm.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thanks for having the show.

**Josh Rubin:** Thanks, Ray. Have a great day.
