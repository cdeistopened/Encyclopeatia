## Introduction and the Nature of Viruses

**Patrick Timpone:** Welcome to part two of our show. Dr. Raymond Peat is on the show with us on the third Monday of each month. He has a PhD and has been at this for 40 or 45 years. Dr. Peat, good morning. I was asking you off the air, but let's dig into this. We just had a guest talking about the idea that viruses like measles and herpes are already in our bodies. The root canal people we've had on have proven through biology and peer-reviewed studies that when they open up these infected root canals, they find things ranging from herpes to syphilis—stuff that is already in the body. Does any of that balance with your perspective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you heard of Peter Duesberg and the HIV critics?

**Patrick Timpone:** A little bit. Tell folks who he is.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I started graduate school in biology in 1968. I think it was in '69 that Temin and Baltimore published an article saying they had evidence that DNA could be transcribed into RNA, and RNA could be transcribed back. According to the existence of that enzyme [reverse transcriptase], there was a possibility for a virus to insert itself from RNA to DNA; it could leave its genes in the nucleus.

At the time, all of my molecular biology professors denied that was possible because they held the dogma that genetic information goes only from DNA to RNA to protein. The idea that RNA could be integrated into the genes as a virus was not supposed to be possible. But it turns out that we are full of retroviruses. Some people say a huge proportion of all of our genes consist of retroviruses. During stress, we emit these, possibly as part of a curative system.

Around just a little while after that, an acupuncturist lent me a pamphlet written by a North Korean claiming he had evidence of particles of nucleic acid circulating in our lymph. He said it looked like our lymphatic system, but was a completely separate circulatory system carrying these virus-like particles that were actually emitted by cells to repair cells in other parts of the body. He wrote that around 1965.

Just in the last 10 years or so, it is now recognized that we are full of these tiny particles carrying RNA, DNA, and proteins emitted under stress. Aging and any sort of sickness or stress cause our cells to emit particles that circulate. They can come out of stressed tissue, be carried in the blood to the bone marrow, and change cells in the bone marrow so that they are able to repair the injured cell. It is a two-way communication of viral-like particles. Since our genome is fairly full of these viral-type particles—retroviruses—it is a very plausible idea that viruses could originate from stressed organisms.

We know that epidemics originate in famines, wars, and conditions that are stressing organisms. They don't necessarily have to travel only from the "green monkey" theory of AIDS, or snake-to-monkey-to-human.

Forty years ago, there were two botanists researching plant viruses at Oregon State University. They would use pumice powder on their fingers and rub solutions of plant viruses into the leaves of plants to create the viral disease they were studying. Within a short period, both of those researchers came down with the same kind of rare degenerative brain disease. To me, that was very suggestive that a plant virus had invaded their system. I stopped eating raw vegetables at that point.

**Patrick Timpone:** If I have a virus that manifests to help repair something in my body—like herpes manifesting on the lips—and these things are already there, can I pass those on to somebody else?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A couple of publications in the last few years have found that within the body, they not only go to the bone marrow to change our immune system cells, but they can actually go to the gonads and enter our germ cells, so they can be passed on. It is exactly what Darwin proposed with his "gemmules" coming from all of the body parts, going into the gonads, and modifying them for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. In this recent research, they demonstrated that the microvesicles do enter germ cells.

A lab in Germany, going back at least 15 years, has demonstrated that if you eat beef, for example, you can trace the genetic DNA patterns—actual long pieces of DNA from the beef—into your bloodstream and into your cells. We are incorporating not only viruses but cellular DNA from the various species that we eat. It is entirely possible that when you cough on someone, they inhale not only viral infections, but your DNA is all around you, and anyone who contacts you is assimilating that. They've demonstrated that in a good number of people; after death, they can test a woman's brain tissue and find DNA traces of each of her previous husbands.

**Patrick Timpone:** Wow. Spiritually, that makes sense if you believe in reincarnation and karma—that we share these things. So was Darwin onto something?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, he had all of the principles down. He just didn't know the details, didn't know there was such a thing as DNA. But he had the idea right.

## COVID-19, ACE2, and Inflammation

**Patrick Timpone:** What kinds of questions have you been getting about this whole Corona thing, and what insights do you have for our audience for March 16th? Where do you think this is going?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I sort of sympathize with Trump in thinking the CDC has been helping a couple of drug companies to increase their share value. The share prices of the vaccine makers are skyrocketing. Both the World Health Organization and CDC have connections with the vaccine industry.

In a typical year, the CDC says an average of about 40,000 Americans die of the flu. Now they are getting excited when a few dozen people die; it is out of proportion to what they claim to be the usual annual mortality from flu.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it true that when they call it the flu, it's really a pneumonia that goes into the lungs?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The way the CDC has built up the market for flu vaccines is to call anyone who dies of pneumonia a "death from influenza." But a very old person, say 100 years old without any particular sickness, might just eat too much raw cabbage, get gas, and that will cause pneumonia. People dying of pneumonia shouldn't necessarily be counted as flu deaths.

However, over 10 years ago, the coronavirus was known to simply activate the well-known inflammation systems, specifically the angiotensin system. For decades we've had angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors. The Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) produces the inflammatory protein that causes blood pressure to rise. There is a close interaction between serotonin and angiotensin, and those are both well-studied causes of aging-related inflammation.

Your angiotensin exposure and production increase in old age, which increases your likelihood of getting pneumonia from anything. It's a general inflammatory system that increases contraction of blood vessels, risk of clotting, and interferes with energy production. The people who are dying at a very high rate from the coronavirus are those who already suffer from circulatory disease, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. They already have an active angiotensin system.

It happens that ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) is the receptor for the virus. The virus attaches to that to enter a cell. ACE2 is the enzyme that undoes the work of ACE itself. ACE produces angiotensin, and ACE2 destroys angiotensin. What the virus does in binding to ACE2 seems to be inactivating the inactivator. That leaves ACE free to make angiotensin, which then doesn't have any way out. So it accumulates, causing the dry cough, high fever, increased hypertension, stroke, and so on.

**Patrick Timpone:** Someone conjectured that Asian people tend to have more of these ACE2 receptors. Is that possible?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it is ACE2, yes. That would make them a better target for the virus. But it would also suggest that, without the virus, they would be more resistant to age-related inflammation. Since ACE2 is the protective enzyme, if you have a lot of it, you are like a young person. Young people have more of that and are less susceptible to age-related degenerative diseases.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why was there so much going on in Wuhan?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Have you heard about the military games? The American soldiers left exactly 14 days before the outbreak. South Korean and Taiwanese virologists have traced the gene pattern back to find that in the US, there are five different strains of the coronavirus. The Wuhan strain is just one of those. They say logically you can derive the Wuhan strain from one of those pre-existing five strains, but you wouldn't have five descendants at this time. The inheritance goes the other way; the Wuhan strain is like a branch on the tree, and the preceding varieties were existing in the US already.

**Patrick Timpone:** And many of us already have these in us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The CDC patented the coronavirus 17 years ago. Research was being done at Fort Detrick, supposedly creating pathogens to create vaccines. The suggestion has been made that there was an accidental release.

**Patrick Timpone:** Some of these strains were lab-created. Does that pose a more substantial problem for the human immune system?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the lab, you can accelerate evolutionary changes and make very improbable things that might never statistically happen in a living organism. The pathogens they create are more imaginative than nature.

**Patrick Timpone:** It seems evident someone will come out with a vaccine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That's why the stock prices have gone up. But the trouble is, as the guy who exposed the non-existence of the swine flu warned, flu viruses mutate faster than you can create a vaccine and test it for safety. By the time you show a vaccine is effective and safe, there will be no flu left of that strain.

## HIV, Stress, and Retroviruses

**Patrick Timpone:** There have been people conjecturing that HIV is not really a virus you can see. A German Supreme Court upheld a claim that the measles virus does not exist.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've followed Peter Duesberg's argument closely now for 40 years, and he has never been proven wrong. He lost his research grants and is officially out of the science world because he persists with his evidence. He says the genetic DNA strip is a retrovirus, but a harmless one, and we are full of such DNA. When we are under stress, it shows up in the blood. So you can have a blood test for it, but all it is showing is that you are a stressed individual.

At the time he was presenting his argument, the information about microvesicles carrying DNA and RNA through the body during stress wasn't known except in the acupuncture world. But it is now common knowledge that stress causes retrovirus material to explode into the bloodstream.

People tested blood samples taken from army recruits in the 1960s—decades before anyone suggested AIDS or HIV existed. Giving the standard DNA analysis to those samples, 0.5% of the population tested positive for AIDS every year, steady as far back as they had samples.

**Patrick Timpone:** So the argument for the gay lifestyle connection could have been fear, angst, or guilt?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Peter Duesberg said it correlated exactly with their use of particular drugs. The drug causes stress and causes the virus to come out, as well as causing the sickness. He correlated it in the Bay Area with a fad of using a particular vasodilator drug for pleasure—poppers. That particular drug creates a very intense stress reaction that causes the release of these retroviruses.

## Bone Healing and Pain Relief

**Patrick Timpone:** We have an email from Amy. She broke three bones in her shoulder and fractured her knee. She used Tabasco for topical pain relief. What can she do to speed up healing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The Tabasco idea is a traditional medical idea to increase circulation; I think it does work. Gentle, low-energy, low-frequency ultrasound greatly accelerates bone healing. You can get a cheap apparatus for around $100. Applying that a little bit every day internally probably imitates the action of Tabasco sauce. Red light also increases open blood vessels, accelerates energy production, and speeds healing. Sunlight is best because it increases your Vitamin D, which is the other essential bone healing factor.

## Starches and Digestion

**Patrick Timpone:** An email asks: You said potatoes, rice, and hominy are good foods. Does that mean you don't care about the glycemic index?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I am cautious about starches. Any starch, even when well-cooked, can pass directly into your bloodstream. In mouse experiments, they showed that starch grains ranging from 5 to 100 microns could pass through the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream unless there was a lot of fat and fiber taken with it. Once in the bloodstream, the particles might be bigger than capillaries and can plug blood vessels.

I stopped eating most starches about 40 years ago when I read that research. The only starch I eat now is hominy or tortillas made with the lime process called nixtamalized corn.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you buy hominy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. The lime breaks down the starch. I had students experiment with it, and it didn't have any of those harmful effects. The lime also digests the protein and makes it more nutritious. It takes out most of the polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), increases the niacin content, and pre-digests the starch.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you do this at home?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can buy powdered lime at any Latino market. For a big kettle, like a gallon of water, put in a pound or two of corn kernels and a heaping tablespoon or two of the lime. Boil it until the seeds swell up to the size of an olive and get soft. That's hominy.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can you do this with wheat, like Einkorn?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Someone emailing me from Italy tried the process on different old traditional grains and said they all work very well.

**Patrick Timpone:** What if you eat a baked potato with a lot of butter and fiber?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The potato itself, especially if you eat the peeling, has enough fiber. If you have lots of cream or butter on it, that helps it to be more digestible. I mostly pass on potatoes due to the allergenic effect of the nightshade family—tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers. Quite a few people have an allergic sensitivity to them.

## Shingles and Viruses

**Patrick Timpone:** Beth asks: What makes a person susceptible to shingles and how to prevent them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a stress breakout of the chickenpox virus of the herpes family. Aspirin, by reducing stress and inflammation, helps prevent recurring episodes. Once it starts, it has to play out, but during that time, do anti-stress things: Vitamin D, lots of milk and orange juice, some aspirin. Vitamin K has some anti-inflammatory effects that protect the blood vessels.

**Patrick Timpone:** If these viruses are doing things they are supposed to do, why try to kill them?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a matter of energy. You can repair yourself if you have the energy. Stress blocks oxygen use, causing you to produce lactic acid instead. Lactic acid accelerates inflammation and further reduces the ability to use oxygen. This process is part of wound healing—a reversion to a primitive state—but for the whole organism, you want to get quickly back to oxygen use.

Carbon dioxide is what should be produced in energy production. Bathing in carbon dioxide—using baking soda and Epsom salts in a bath—helps. The body absorbs the carbon dioxide, which turns off the inflammatory process and suppresses the wasteful production of lactic acid.

## Hearing Loss

**Patrick Timpone:** Chris asks about hearing loss. Can it be reversed?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thyroid is the single most important thing. Publications show that high estrogen and prolactin damage the hair cells in the hearing apparatus. Those tend to go up with aging. Thyroid and Vitamin D are among the things that prevent that damage.

## Atherosclerosis and Arteries

**Patrick Timpone:** Larry, 73, has a 100% occluded carotid artery. His doctor wants an angiogram. Any suggestions?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The angiotensin system is at the root of atherosclerosis. Experiments show you can reverse the process using ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Losartan, for example. A recent article in *The Lancet* warned against using Losartan for the virus, but the Chinese have evidence it is protective. Separate research shows Losartan helps reverse atherosclerosis and has a general anti-inflammatory process.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is Losartan a pharmaceutical?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Progesterone is the body's natural equivalent; it lowers receptor production, but it's not as immediate and powerful as the pharmaceutical.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about high-dose Vitamin C?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A little helps, but manufactured stuff is never absolutely clean. An experimenter showed that reagent-grade ascorbic acid in distilled water was as full of free radicals as a killing dose of X-rays.

## Vitamin D, Calcium, and Calcification

**Patrick Timpone:** How do folks figure out a Vitamin D dosage?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** 5,000 units a day brings most people into the healthy range (50 to 60 nanograms per milliliter).

**Patrick Timpone:** Are there downsides to having too much D?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is highly exaggerated. It takes a million units a day for many days to get real calcification. The biggest misunderstanding is thinking that dietary calcium and Vitamin D go right into soft tissues. What causes calcification of soft tissues is a failure of energy.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and aldosterone collaborate to knock down energy production. PTH's main function is to pull calcium out of your bones for emergency use in the blood. When aldosterone and PTH are high, you get increased blood calcium and calcification of soft tissues.

If you lower your aldosterone and PTH by having enough calcium and salt in your diet—thousands of milligrams of calcium a day—it will tend *not* to calcify your arteries. It keeps calcium in the bones. Warning people not to eat calcium and restricting Vitamin D is exactly what will increase blood vessel calcification.

**Patrick Timpone:** So dark greens are good?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, because they have a high ratio of calcium and magnesium to phosphate. Nuts, seeds, meat, and fish have high phosphate, which increases parathyroid hormone. However, it is best to let the cow eat the greens and then drink the milk. The cow has the apparatus to detoxify the plant toxins in the leaves.

## Caller Q&A: Cold Hands and Thyroid

**Caller (Mo):** I started drinking orange juice and for the first time in 25 years, my hands and feet were warm. Now they are cold again. Also, my TSH went from 2 or 3 down to 0.1.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Healthy people have the lowest TSH, but stress hormones can also lower it. If cortisol and adrenaline go sharply up, that can lower TSH. You need to check your temperature, heart rate, and T3 levels.

**Patrick Timpone:** Why did the orange juice help initially?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It contains powerful anti-inflammatory flavonoids like naringin and nobiletin that help the thyroid work. When hands suddenly get cold, look for calcium or Vitamin D deficiency, or not getting enough salt. Salt and calcium work closely to hold down the aldosterone/parathyroid system.

**Caller (Mo):** What about the progesterone formula?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The formula I designed in the 1970s—progesterone in Vitamin E and natural coconut oil—is made by a company called Kenogen.

## Rapid Fire Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** Any fiction books or movies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** None come to the top of my head.

**Patrick Timpone:** Tell us about your newsletter.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You can email raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. The latest one is about Gilbert Ling's work. He died last fall. He was one of my early influences in biology. He gave a clear, consistent explanation of cell function, whereas the standard theories are essentially impossible fantasies.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can estriol be used topically for wrinkles?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It makes the skin take up water, so it plumps up, but it alters the collagen. Estriol is the weakest estrogen, but people use 10 times more to get the effect, which ends up being the same as estradiol—pro-aging. It makes the skin swell with water, looking smooth and shiny, but it isn't good.

**Patrick Timpone:** What soap do you use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Pure coconut soap.

**Patrick Timpone:** Role of norepinephrine/adrenaline?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Adrenaline has been maligned. It activates other stress hormones like cortisol, so if it persists, it is harmful. However, things that momentarily increase adrenaline can be helpful if stopped soon enough. Thyroid has a relaxing function. When you first take thyroid, if you have been overproducing adrenaline to compensate for hypothyroidism, you might experience a stress reaction. Having sugar and salt while adjusting to thyroid helps keep adrenaline under control.

**Patrick Timpone:** Leg cramps at night?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The parasympathetic system turns on when you lie down. With age, the parasympathetic system overpowers the adrenaline system, causing blood sugar to drop. Falling blood sugar turns on other stress hormones, leading to cramps or even asthma at night.

**Patrick Timpone:** Pneumonia home treatment?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anti-inflammatory things: chicken soup (salt and gelatin), orange juice, milk, ice cream, aspirin, and Losartan.

**Patrick Timpone:** Which potato has the most ketones?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Russets have the best nutrition. Yukon Golds have yellow carotene which interferes with starch breakdown.

**Patrick Timpone:** Lutefisk (fish cooked in lye)?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it was just a preservative method.

**Patrick Timpone:** Magnesium carbonate?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Be cautious. Many products have impurities that cause bad headaches.

**Patrick Timpone:** Venous reflux/varicose veins?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Usually caused by a hormone imbalance—high estrogen in relation to progesterone. High estrogen weakens the vein walls.

**Patrick Timpone:** Does Ray Peat believe in God?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I am a fan of process theology. Google Alfred North Whitehead; he was one of my philosophical influences.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dental cavitations?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If there is no pain, there is almost certainly no infection. Sometimes the bone doesn't fill in the hole, but that is no problem. I don't think surgery is needed.

**Patrick Timpone:** Edamame soy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay as a condiment in very limited amounts. A study in Hawaii found dementia was higher in tofu eaters. Another study in China found milk drinkers had a much lower incidence of dementia.

**Patrick Timpone:** My husband massaged my legs and swelling reduced.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yep.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thanks so much for being here.
