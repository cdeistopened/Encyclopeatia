## Introduction and Scientific Writing

**Patrick Timpone:** Welcome to hour two. Dr. Raymond Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He has taught at schools like the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968. His website is RayPeat.com. Good morning, Dr. Peat.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Good morning.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you distinguish real science from fake news when you are reading research?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I first went to college, I was a literature and English major. Doing that, you learn how to interpret who a person is just from fairly short passages of their writing. You can tell their philosophy and what their mind is like just from the way they construct a few sentences.

Starting almost 100 years ago, science and medical journals started imposing a way of writing that creates the impression that there is no person present. Despite that stylized, impersonal, so-called "objective" way of writing, you can detect the mind of the person behind those sentences. I think of science and medical writing as political propaganda writing. It's the same as reading the newspaper; you know it's going to be 90% lies, but you figure out the motives for why they chose that subject. The motives will explain the way they use their terms, the assumptions they make, and the way they draw conclusions from the evidence.

**Patrick Timpone:** It is similar to how people have begun to discern fake news in politics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is much better than 20 or 30 years ago, but most people are still gullible. For example, dietitians and doctors writing about statins or other trillion-dollar drugs.

## Current Health Trends: Cancer and Radiation

**Patrick Timpone:** What are some of the subjects that are generating the most interest these days? Are there particular illnesses showing up frequently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Hair loss and obesity are the most common. However, there is an awful lot of cancer recently. Cancer is displacing heart disease in the people I've been talking to. I think the things we are being exposed to are creating cancer in young people. It isn't being publicized because people generally think about age-related cancer, but in the last 10 years, there has been a big surge in cancer in people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it because the air, food, and water are getting toxic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is the combination of lots of PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) in the diet and lots of radiation. Tongue cancer is practically an epidemic compared to what it used to be. We are seeing tongue cancer, tonsil cancer, eye cancer, thyroid, and brain cancer from a combination of cell phones around the head and dental X-rays.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is the source of tongue cancer known?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think oral X-rays are probably the best explanation. They talk about new sensitive instruments that don't make as much radiation per exposure, but then they give you panoramic X-rays that make dozens of exposures. Even though each one is low exposure, the sum is much more than people used to get.

## Thyroid Supplements: Natural vs. Synthetic

**Patrick Timpone:** We have several emails wondering why you were suggesting synthetic hormone replacement rather than the natural desiccated thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't know about every brand, but there are now lots of desiccated thyroid gland products available. A hundred years ago, and up until the 1990s, the Armour company was the main producer of desiccated thyroid. They were testing every batch from beef and pork, and every batch was standardized in potency by testing it on mice.

In the 90s, that stopped. One of the major producers started extracting and selling thyrocalcitonin from the powder. So, you can't tell whether the powder is the entire gland the way it used to be. Now you are likely to get a fractionated extract. Since they don't standardize it on mice, you don't know the potency. In Mexico, I got some thyroid glands from a slaughterhouse and found they had almost no thyroid activity; something in the animal feed had apparently ruined their thyroids.

If you aren't standardizing the product, the only way you can tell what you're getting is to get a good batch and test it on yourself. With the natural product, it takes about two months of adjusting the dose to really know how much you should be taking. With the two or three good synthetic products, they are adjusted to a standard. For example, I've been using Cynoplus, which was based on Armour Thyroid's composition. I've been using this one product for about 30 years and the potency hasn't noticeably changed.

**Patrick Timpone:** So there are no issues with the fact that it is synthetic?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was designed by the Armour Thyroid company itself to imitate their own Armour Thyroid USP. The synthetic is continuing that same composition. With new companies that try to make T3 or T4, if they don't test it on animals, those materials are very hard to keep functional in a pill. If you don't use the well-known products such as Thyrolar or Cynoplus, it is a matter of testing those over a period of a few weeks.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are there downsides to "glandulars"?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I hear stories almost every day of bad results with so-called glandulars. They often put additives in it, or desiccated liver along with the desiccated gland. Chemicals in the liver or additives can alter the effect of the thyroid. Also, if the animals are given fattening diets with lots of PUFA, that blocks the thyroid.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener has a desiccated thyroid product that claims to have specific amounts of T3 and T4 on the label.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** As far as I can tell, those numbers are something the FDA told them to put on the label. Unless you standardize it on an animal, those numbers are fiction. A chemist took a product from Thailand that claimed specific micrograms of substances. He tested for those and found zero in the product. I explained that is normal; the gland *should* contain zero T3 and T4. When we eat the gland, we digest it, and the digestive process creates those hormones. He hydrolyzed the pills with acid, tested it, and they did have exactly what they claimed. But it is simply false—an FDA fiction—to put on a glandular product that it contains free T3 and T4.

## Body Temperature, Heart Health, and TSH

**Patrick Timpone:** We were discussing infrared saunas during the break. How does heat relate to the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Raising your body temperature is one of the basic, essential things that the thyroid hormone does. Broda Barnes, a pioneer in the prevention of heart disease, judged his thyroid dose for his patients on the basis of their temperature. If they woke up very far from 98 degrees and didn't rise to 98.6 by the afternoon, he would adjust their thyroid dose. In his long practice of 30 years, he didn't have any of his patients die from heart disease.

Even just warming up your body with a hot bath regularly does many of the things that the thyroid hormone does. Currently, the medical profession estimates thyroid function based on TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). TSH rises when we are deficient in actual thyroid function. When you correct the body temperature and keep your oxygen consumption up, your TSH goes very low. A healthy population was found to have no thyroid cancer if their TSH was 0.4 or below. The TSH itself promotes inflammation, hypertension, and degenerative processes. Yet, doctors won't prescribe thyroid until you get an extremely high TSH.

## T4 vs. T3 Supplementation

**Patrick Timpone:** If folks have a high TSH, how do they know if they need T4 or T3?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Most men will get along with either. In the 1940s, synthetic thyroid was tested on young male medical students, and they found that T4 (thyroxine) worked just like natural Armour thyroid. However, women of all ages, especially when their estrogen is high, are sometimes extremely insensitive to a T4 supplement. It can actually lower their thyroid function by suppressing the TSH and turning off the conversion of T4 to T3.

I knew of a patient who was brought in comatose because her doctors started her on 100 micrograms of thyroxine and she got worse. They raised it to 400 micrograms, and she went into a coma. Someone in the hospital knew about the function of the liver and T3, gave her T3 immediately, and she came out of the coma. The female liver has to convert T4 to T3, but estrogen blocks that process. That is why women have 5 to 10 times the incidence of thyroid deficiency as men.

**Patrick Timpone:** A doctor suggested that the ratio of Free T3 to Reverse T3 should be about 20 to 1. Does that sound reasonable?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it's probably ideal, but people get along with a lower ratio.

**Patrick Timpone:** Regarding taking pure T3, I've seen people putting it into a powder and taking a little bit every few hours. Why can't you just take the whole 25 micrograms at once?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The liver is the main source naturally. At the very maximum, we are getting about 4 micrograms per hour naturally, but on average, we produce about 2 micrograms per hour. If you take 25 micrograms at once, the liver experiences a tenfold excess and shuts down.

I experimented on myself taking 25 micrograms only in the morning. After two weeks, I noticed my thyroid gland had disappeared—there was a depression where the gland should be. The real problem was that at sunset, my heart began stopping 10 times per minute. I found that if I took 10 micrograms of T3 and chewed it up, within 15 seconds the perfect rhythm would be back. I realized I had activated my liver enzymes to the point that they were throwing off the T3, creating a profound deficiency just 12 hours after the single pill.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you have to dose it frequently?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. A friend had a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital. His enzymes indicated part of his heart was dying. His wife started giving him 1 microgram of T3 per hour with orange juice. That afternoon, his enzymes started normalizing. The doctors said that never happened.

**Patrick Timpone:** How do you dose that small amount?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Some people just nibble a little crumb off the side of a tablet or powder it. It doesn't have to be exact, just so you don't have those gigantic surges.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can taking thyroid help the gland recover?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've seen several people recover their thyroid function just by taking a supplement, but it's fairly rare because it is usually chronic stress that has suppressed the gland.

**Patrick Timpone:** What is the difference between taking T3 versus the T4/T3 combination?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** T4 is only active by conversion to T3, which activates the oxidative heat-producing process. T4 takes a long time to equilibrate in the body; it has a half-life of about two weeks. T3 has a half-life of about one day. So you can get up to normal quickly with T3, but it takes several weeks to find your stable response to T4.

Also, deep venous thrombosis and other clotting problems are usually resolved by a thyroid supplement. When your thyroid is low, your clotting is up.

## Diet and Thyroid Health

**Patrick Timpone:** Other than supplementation, what can we do food-wise to boost the thyroid?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) are the main things that interfere with thyroid production, transport, and response. Also, excess protein—specifically the thyroid-suppressing amino acids tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine—will interfere with thyroid function.

**Patrick Timpone:** I've heard you should eat animal protein in the morning to boost thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You need orange juice first to get your thyroid going.

## Acne, Hormones, and "Rejuvenation"

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener writes that she is eating liver, eggs, and bone broth, and avoiding PUFAs. She feels better, but she is getting painful acne.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** When I first supplemented DHEA, I got acne. One of the thyroid's most important functions is to increase your conversion of cholesterol to progesterone and DHEA. The surge of new, youth-related hormones can give a 50-year-old person teenage acne.

It takes a good balance of nutrients. Too much protein relative to carbohydrate can dip your blood sugar and cause a stress reaction that activates cortisol. If your thyroid is good, the adrenals will make a surge of DHEA, which can make the skin oily. Acne is a sign that the skin is rejuvenating its oil and moisture glands. However, stimulating the conversion of cholesterol increases the consumption of Vitamin A. A Vitamin A deficiency can make the immune system fail and allow bacteria to grow on the skin.

**Patrick Timpone:** Is that why people take cod liver oil?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, but it comes with Vitamin D and fish oil. Young people do well with fish oil because when the thyroid is up, it can consume and excrete the fish oil fats. But when you are under stress, the fish oil tends to accumulate, break down, and produce inflammation and immune-suppressive products.

## Cell Membranes and PUFAs

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks about the cell membrane—is it polarized water?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think it should be referred to as the cell surface, an interface between two phases. Every interface between ionically different substances will have an electric double layer. This creates the microscopic appearance of a membrane, but there is no barrier membrane. Gilbert Ling showed long ago that sodium moves in and out freely, which disproves the barrier membrane theory.

**Patrick Timpone:** How does this apply to health?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the selling points for fish oil was that PUFAs are essential for making membranes. They say our brains are 60% fish oil. But if you look at a newborn baby, their brains are defined as "essential fatty acid deficient" because they contain Mead acids. If you want a newborn, energetic, able-to-learn brain, you don't want it loaded with fish oil. That accumulates during adulthood and increases the risk of nerve diseases by age 50.

## Electrons, Oxidation, and Vitamin C

**Patrick Timpone:** We've been told that toxic substances steal electrons and cause oxidation. Is that correct?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is one idea, but surprisingly, if you cut off the oxygen supply, you get a surge of oxidative damage. If you run an animal at a high rate with thyroid, their free radical production drops drastically. The faster the mitochondria run consuming oxygen, the less oxidative damage there is.

Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) inside cells exists as dehydroascorbate, which is an oxidant. The so-called "antioxidants" work because inside the cell they are pro-oxidative. If a cell is suffocated and can't use oxygen, electrons accumulate. An excess of electrons is what creates destructive, cell-killing oxidation by way of iron.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you recommend extra Vitamin C?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, because milk and meat are very good sources. I experimented by stopping all known sources like fruits and eating mostly milk, meat, and eggs. My urine Vitamin C output was still around 3,000 milligrams per day.

## Cholesterol

**Patrick Timpone:** Is it safe to raise cholesterol levels by supplementing with dried cholesterol powder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There has been research showing it improved autistic kids, but I don't know the source. Years ago, "chemically pure" cholesterol used in experiments was found to be oxidized and toxic. I wouldn't risk taking a supplement unless you knew it wasn't oxidized.

**Patrick Timpone:** Does eating cholesterol raise your levels?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No. When you eat more cholesterol, you shut off your own liver's production. To keep cholesterol up (which protects against dementia), you need thyroid and sugar to keep inflammation down in the intestine. Eating raw vegetables feeds bacteria that create endotoxin, which poisons the liver and stops it from making adequate cholesterol.

**Patrick Timpone:** So you prefer cooked vegetables?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, overcooking actually. Raw vegetables lower your cholesterol because they feed bacteria that poison your liver. A diet rich in non-irritating, easily absorbed foods like milk and orange juice supports the liver.

## Thyroid Dosing and Safety

**Patrick Timpone:** Can the body store too much T4?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If it stores too much T4, that generally interferes with the conversion to T3. The real problem with taking too much T4 is the risk of turning off your brain metabolism. Taking too big a dose too fast can make you short of breath and give you a fast heartbeat.

However, when used properly, it is the best way to prevent heart attacks. I knew a woman with a fibroid tumor who wanted to get pregnant. She took Armour thyroid, gradually working up until her resting heart rate was 110. The tumor shrank, and she had a perfect pregnancy. That was a deliberate overdose to lower estrogen.

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener asks how long she needs to take small doses of T3 to raise her temperature.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you have elevated liver enzymes, small doses can normalize liver function within a few days. T3 acts within seconds. You can see exactly what you are doing, so you avoid overdosing. If you start with T4, you see no results for days, so you might load up and then overshoot.

**Patrick Timpone:** Should people see their pulse rate move up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, very slightly. One or two beats per minute per day is fine. If you get up to the ideal pulse and temperature in four or five hours, you are going to overshoot because T3 has a 12 to 24-hour accumulating half-life. It is best to work up gradually.

## Menstruation and Estrogen

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener says she decided not to have a menstrual cycle in ninth grade and stopped having them.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cycles are governed by the brain. Stress is the main thing that turns off the cycles. It isn't good for an overstressed person to get pregnant, so the body regulates to avoid it.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do women live longer because they stop menstruating?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Iron absorption really begins at menopause because progesterone production fails. Progesterone is needed to cause cells to release and excrete estrogen. Without progesterone, you have intracellular estrogen excess. Estrogen causes iron retention. So in old age, women tend to catch up with men in iron overload symptoms like heart disease.

## Bone Broth

**Patrick Timpone:** Is bone broth as healthy as they claim?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not if it is made with marrow bones, because of the fat and iron in the marrow. The healthy broth is made from the joints—cartilage, tendons, and ligaments—which are rich in gelatin, but not the marrow bones.

## Gut Inflammation and Diet

**Patrick Timpone:** We have a caller, Mike, with severe digestive inflammation. He juices beets and carrots but reacts to fibrous foods.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The main thing is to reduce fermentable grains, nuts, vegetables, and starches. Use foods that are quickly digested and absorbed: milk, meat, eggs, and sweet fruits.

Cooked bamboo shoots, well-cooked mushrooms, and raw carrots are antiseptic. However, carrot juice is very rich in carotene. If you juice it, the carotene will accumulate, turn your skin orange, and suppress your thyroid and testosterone.

**Patrick Timpone:** Mike mentions getting freezing cold after eating broccoli or cauliflower.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is true. They contain goitrogens that suppress thyroid activity.

## Hashimoto's and Autoimmunity

**Patrick Timpone:** You've mentioned Hashimoto's is not really the immune system attacking the thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The immune system recognizes damage to your own tissue and goes in to remove it. Recent theorists have proposed the "danger or damage" theory: the immune system recognizes damaged tissue as foreign. If you damage your thyroid by taking too much iodine or PUFA, that is structural damage the immune system tries to clean up. It is usually an excess of estrogen interfering with stabilizing hormones (DHEA, progesterone) that causes the tissue to look "damaged." Re-energizing the cell stops the autoimmune process.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about the theory that it's the body attacking the Epstein-Barr virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is probably valid as *one* of the causes of tissue damage. But Epstein-Barr goes wild in a hypothyroid person because of low energy.

## Rapid Fire Questions

**Patrick Timpone:** A listener takes aspirin for joint pain. Is that safe?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes. Aspirin activates thyroid function and mitochondrial oxidation. 1mg of Vitamin K per day is adequate to keep the liver making clotting agents, which aspirin might affect.

**Patrick Timpone:** Are potatoes bad for kidney disease due to potassium?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That is mainstream medical mythology.

**Patrick Timpone:** Can a woman live well without estrogen after a hysterectomy?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A skinny person is fairly safe, but the plumper you are, the more risk you have of accumulating dangerous amounts of estrogen (produced by body fat).

**Patrick Timpone:** What causes hot flashes to return?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Increased estrogen and nitric oxide production, often from a change in intestinal flora.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about heart palpitations and a thickened left ventricle?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Traditionally, they blamed heart enlargement on the thyroid, but fibrosis of the heart is actually reversed by T3. Fibrosis is a product of not enough oxygen, too much nitric oxide, estrogen, and stress.

**Patrick Timpone:** My resting pulse is 60. Is that okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think people feel best with an 85 per minute resting pulse.

**Patrick Timpone:** Do you recommend B12 supplementation?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Generally no, because we make it in our intestine. High B12 often indicates bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (SIBO), caused by slow digestion.

**Patrick Timpone:** What about hydrogenated coconut oil vs. virgin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Extra virgin has aroma but also 2-3% PUFA. Hydrogenated has been treated so there is no PUFA left. It is extremely stable. I use the hydrogenated version.

**Patrick Timpone:** Dr. Peat, thank you for being so generous with your time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thank you.
